Cardano commercialization of the platform is already underway. Cardano is getting nation states and bringing millions of users in through that push model. Cardano also decentralized finance, and non-fungible token marketplaces.

No professional trader will ever post their working strategies for the public. If too many people use it it will be countertraded very quickly.

The best way to learn is mostly to collect as much experience as possible. Write down what is going wrong and most important STICK TO YOUR RULES.

&#x200B;

Most newbie trader fail because they are emotionally unstable or fomo and of course cannot calculate their risk until stop loss.

So i will help you with that:

Let's say you want to risk 2% of your total balance until your SL is reached.

Current Balance: 10k USD

Current BTC price: 60k USD

Stop Loss BTC price: 55k USD

2% Risk = 200 USD

(10k:100x2) : (60k-55k) = position size

&#x200B;

You don't need leverage at all in most of the cases.

China can easily modify their ""great firewall"" to identify blockchain servers and refuse to forward their packets.  It wouldn't stop 100%, but it could easily stop 80% and render the network unreliable and unusable.

By the way, China is not ""banning bitcoin over and over.""  They've banned it one time, and they're giving people a chance to opt out before they ramp up more and more enforcement.  They'll continue to crack down more and more over time if people continue to violate their directives.  They have the power and the ability to do so.   

If bitcoin operated on its own autonomous network, it might be different.  But you can't be a parasite on a network that the state exclusively controls, and expect that the state can't stop you.  They absolutely can.  And like I said, they don't need to stop 100% to render it unusable.

Crypto requires a high degree of ubiquity and popularity in order to hold any value.  China as well as most other large nation states, easily have the ability to nullify the ubiquity of crypto if they so desire.  They haven't gone that route yet, but that's just because crypto really isn't the threat people think it is.

It simply comes down to psychology for DOGE as it's the biggest pump & dump scheme going and when you have Elon Musk using his social media power to influence people by touting about DOGE, it's inevitable that it has a big move over a prolonged period of time.

What I find concerning is that DOGE is only powered by the hype, the support of Musk and people looking for a quick and easy win to ""instant riches"".

DOGE embodies everything that holds Cryptocurrency adoption back.  
I am sure this will upset the DOGE lovers out there but hey that's OK, the DOGE holders can have their wins, I will continue to steer clear because DOGE is all FOMO. Yes I know supply and demand can be described as that but I'd probably give DOGE a little more of a nod if Elon Musk shuts up or proves beyond doubt that he owns a substantial bag of it.

1691,2021-06-19,"Guys Titan went from $0.3 to $64 and pumped for weeks. It was a very unusual occurrence, even in defi. I applaud Cuban for having the balls to play around with liquidity pools. In defi these things happen, and if you aren’t devoting half of your waking hours to tracking it, you’re going to run into situations like these. We need some regulation, it would be good for crypto. Anytime a project fails, it hurts all of crypto. Simply having regulated code standards to be listed on Dexes would help to legitimize the entire crypto space and help everyone.

If you aren’t in defi and you’re invested in crypto, you’re getting fucked. Defi investors are able to make much more money than CEX investors and HODLers. It’s just not for the faint hearted or passive investors. All coins continuously pay defi users, while HODLers and exchange users have to watch their coins get devalued by inflation from defi. However, you will run into the occasional rug, but it’s not hard to spot them if you do your due diligence. I’m not surprised he got suckered by this one though, it was a very very rare unique stable coin malfunction, and although the red flags were there, it was tough to figure out what was going on before it went south. 

I will add, for those commenting, Titan/Iron was not a rug pull. It was a fundamental error in the incentives and tokenomics of 2 linked coins.

2229,2021-01-30,"To all the new people coming to crypto! Don't chase pumps!!! Accumulate undervalued assets with real use case! I was once new and was desperately looking for legitimate information. Now is my time to give back to the community!  


The most adopted crypto marketplace project by enterprises and governments around the world is working in the supply chain niche. The best part about it? TOKENOMICS. The token actually has value and will easy 15-20 X from the current price. If you know anything about investing with a value-based strategy, this my friends is THE MOST undervalued asset in the entire ecosystem!

The way this platform leverages technologies — not just blockchain — is entirely unique in this space.

Imagine a supply chain platform that can pivot to EOS, IPFS, Holochain or Hyperledger (very different types of DLT's), the same way it can pivot to an SAP / MS Dynamics ERP system,

or a FedEx / DHS / UPS API, or a SWIFT / AccessPay Payment Platform, or a Customs Border Protection Compliance Platform, or an IoT device like Hanhaa Parcelive attached to an actual container in transit, or an AI / Machine Learning algorithm.... SEAMLESSLY using a simple drag and drop interface — all contained within a fully automated workflow that is 100% reconciled and notarized on the ETH mainnet.

Literally every technology out there - including other proprietary blockchains (like Vechain) - can be integrated within the platform and leveraged in a fully automated and reconcilable workflow.

Once Morpheus.Network reaches a bottleneck with the current way the platform is functioning (literally hashing all these tx's to mainnet as each module completes) the team will launch an ETH side-chain via masternodes that will batch a majority of the tx's together and only hash to ETH mainnet at a cadence which the customer needs (hourly, daily, etc.).  


You will be amazed in Morpheus.Networks growth that will take place over the next 2 years. They already have 25+ resellers worldwide who are all highly incentivized to sell the tech! Your most solid 30-50 X if you manage to hold it for 9-18 months!

FUD is what YOU create in your own mind based on your perception/assumptions of some news event or outside stimuli.

Its your EMOTIONS that fuck you over, and that emotional response is happening in 90% of all the other retail traders at the SAME time as you are experiancing it..... EVERY SINGLE TIME! This is such a well know psychological response in people that institutional traders can BANK on retail traders doing ""X"" if institutional traders push emotional button ""A"" in retail traders!  

When you are basing your trading decisions on news and interpreting that news by jumping to ASSUMPTIONS and reacting with EMOTIONS, is it any wonder you end up on the wrong side of the market move? Is it any wonder that this automatic response in people can be used by institutional traders to manipulate retail traders? 

This is trader psychology 101!  

Institutional traders know this 100% and use it to manipulate YOU, the retail weak handed investor in and out of your positions as THEY need you to act!

If the exchange rates were as close to market as Coinbase, Kraken, Gemini, Binance, etc are when you convert fiat to crypto, except now you get the crypto on payday rather than the normal like 7 day waiting period before you can move your funds... how is that so horrible compared to getting a check and buying crypto with it?

Watch out for anything higher than 45% up and 35% down.""

It's not as consistent here, but the common stuff will be better to watch. Allow up to 10% correction on 3+ day avg value increases.

It’s really ETH’s game to lose, they have to keep innovating and keep up with services for users and customers, and I honestly don’t think they can.

Just like using stone wheels for a store of wealth, it might work for a while but then the next best thing will come out and your wealth will disappear (if you do not act fast enough).  I will say Ethereum migrating to proof of stake will possibly cause it to miss the proverbial iceberg that governments want to throw in front of the titanic of crypto.   Energy based mining may come to an end or a severe disruption due to carbon emissions restrictions and 'going green', new schemes of low energy mining are going to have to be adopted (which of course Ethereum already is going that route).

In 2020 we went from a dual income to single income household, my pay took a significant cut, and we moved to a much more expensive city due to my work. We were by no means living on the streets but we definitely had to pick and choose what we spent money on. In early 2021 I decided to use what little savings I had left to start investing in stocks and crypto. I started with diverse portfolios for stocks and crypto but a particular memecoin I invested in rapidly made my investment worthwhile. Then I decided to sell everything else that was in the red and invest more into the memecoin. In just a few months and with a few thousand dollars I made about a third of my annual salary. I sold half of my coins and used it to pay off my car and pay down my credit card debt. Whatever cash was leftover got reinvested into stocks. All I’m saying is there’s no way I could’ve achieved that so fast with most other coins. While I understand why some are so heavily invested in more established blockchain coins, I think a large portion of people in meme crypto are invested to supplement their income and they see it as hopeless to invest into something that they’ll only be able to own a fraction of a share. I’m sure I left some stuff out and probably have some errors but I’m typing this while I get up and get ready to start my day lol.

3931,2021-03-04,"He's right.

I've tested my own strategy with a small live cash trading account. My strategy basically turns the stock market into a risk-free factory production line. Long hours (40-50 hrs per week), and those hours are intense, no half-measures. Here it is:

\- NEVER EVER use leverage, margin, options, calls, puts, any of that crap. Spot trading only. Only ever go long (buy low or sell high - those are both exactly the same thing). If you're trading with any kind of borrowed money, you're doing it wrong.

\- Trade between exactly 4 tickers that ALL pair with each other (so there should be 6 pairs: AB AC AD BC BD CD). One is your home currency (USD, GBP, EUR, etc), another is probably the exchange's in-house currency, and two cryptocurrencies (probably BTC and ETH, but any two will do). Forex is a time-bomb, when a hedgie farts sideways you lose everything. All four of your tickers must be paired with each other and all have a large volume of movement.

\- Learn how to read a 1-minute chart. If you can't predict with 80%+ accuracy when a stock is changing direction, you need to go learn that first (Look up ""Raynor Teo"").

\- When you get it wrong (it happens), look at the other charts for that commodity you hold and see where else you can take profit from the time of your last trade. If, worst case scenario, your stock is losing value everywhere, then just wait it out - This ""lockout"" happens occasionally, but it's rare - NEVER SELL LOW, NEVER USE A STOP LOSS. This ""agility"" to change chart or wait it out is only possible with spot trading. NEVER EVER BORROW MONEY OR BET IN ANY WAY AT ALL, ONLY TRADE WHAT YOU PUT IN.

Doing this in my testing, and going at it hard, I make about 5-10 trades per hour at 0.1%-0.2% net profit each (after broker and tax fees deducted), giving me total of up to 1% profit per hour, every hour, consistently.

This only works with small amounts up to around £8,000 ($10,000) maximum. When you hit that limit, withdraw 75% to your savings account and start the process again. Trying this quick-fire strategy with larger sums of money doesn't work because your orders take too long to fill before the price jumps up your arse. THIS WILL NOT MAKE YOU A MILLIONAIRE, but if you put in the 40+ intense hours it can make you a few grand per month, better than flipping burgers or delivering pizza.

*(Legal disclaimer: It works for me but please don't go blindly risking your money on my advice, I'm not responsible for your losses. Do your own testing and research. If you lose money with this strategy, you're 100% to blame because you didn't do it right.)*",positive,0.8977734,37

Day-trading can be a lot more profitable than hodling. If for example bitcoin goes up 50 % in one year, you could make 50 % with hodling. Great. But since crypto currencies tend to fluctuate a lot, you can make profit between two price levels several times before the currency drops below a certain point or gets very bullish again. 
If the bitcoin price just increases monotonously the whole year, you make just about the same as a hodler. If it fluctuates a lot, you make considerably more money.",positive,0.7937208,2

But this is not what the simulation predicts. The most likely scenario is that, by the end of the week, the price remains between the range 30-40k (80.5% chance). I hope that this helped clarify this aspect.

Why is this type of simulation useful? Risk management. Since the odds of prices falling below 30k is higher than prices going over 40k, investors/traders can obtain a number, a parameter that tells them how much risk they are exposing themselves in a given operation (long/short) and aids them in the decision making.

I did more research and found out that there is malware present on my computer that scans copy-pasted info that seems like BTC address (and/or Ethereum, but I haven't tested it out) and replaces it with their own BTC address. (The address I put in above was the scammers)

Apparently, this is a common occurrence. This is probably the reasoning behind every exchange asking you to double-check the recipient's address.

You might not even be aware that this malware is present on your computer. You might just be sending small amounts of crypto comparatively to your whole portfolio and didn't realize it never made it to your own address.

My Freiexchange BTC address is ""396SqVuKMZ5LSN2XYhAtvP9LQEDQWdAyAS""

but when I copy-pasted that into my BTC withdrawal section on Binance, it pasted the scammer's address. I only realized what happened when I checked my email and noticed it didn't match my Freiexchange address and thought I must've copied a different crypto deposit but networks can recognize if a specific deposit address only accepts BTC. So as I searched around Reddit and google, I found out that Trojan Malware exists on my computer :(

So now I lost all of the BTC that I bought from Binance and if you keep refreshing the scammer's address, they have taken a lot more than $500.

[blockchain.coinmarketcap.com/address/bitcoin/3KniJQ6YQyNAp3UW6ggYsoCtWjk9FyjUUC](https://blockchain.coinmarketcap.com/address/bitcoin/3KniJQ6YQyNAp3UW6ggYsoCtWjk9FyjUUC)

If you check their BTC address, you can see how many BTC deposits they've accumulated and transferred to their own personal wallets.

Be careful guys, now I know why every big market exchange has a warning about copy-pasting the correct address, a painful lesson for me but even worse for those who tried to transfer more than $10,000. :/",positive,0.5857174,257

1.) Every single program/software is essentially a attack vector, keep your OS updated, keep your software updated, and uninstall ANY thing you don’t use anymore. Just look up the SolarWinds hack and see how supply chain attacks work.

2.) Don’t download random stuff from this site or any other. If you want to, check the hash of the software. This can be done using “Certutil -hashfile ‘filename’ sha256” in the windows cmd (Linux you can use “sha256sum ‘filename’”) you can then enter the hash into VirusTotal.com to see if it comes back malicious.

3.) Keeping your seed phrase safe, I personally store it in a KeePass database file (encrypted) then put that file on 2 USB drives and store it in 2 different secure locations.",positive,0.9375837,2

4232,2021-03-02," Goldman Sachs Group is restarting a trading desk for cryptocurrencies amid a surge in the value of Bitcoin.

[Click here to read the original source.](https://mosttraded.com/2021/03/02/goldman-sachs-into-crypto/)

Crypto was once shunned at elite firms like Goldman Sachs, but is now gaining credibility as other banks and financial institutions outline their efforts. BNY Mellon said in mid February that it will hold, transfer and issue digital currencies, a step it called the first by a global bank to provide clients with such services. Mastercard Inc. has also said it will allow cardholders to transact in cryptocurrencies on its network. The firm is “actively engaging” with central banks around the world on their plans to launch new digital currencies, it said last month.

(That it may not materialize is almost beside the point; that the local mayor may be willing to facilitate crypto usage is the larger takeaway.)

Listening carefully, the residents of Cool Valley can hear the shrieking in the White House, Washington D.C., from over 800 miles away.  Interestingly, the same sort of shrieking sounds were reported to have been heard being emitted by U.S. Congress from far away at the time that El Salvador adopted its new monetary policy making bitcoin legal tender and giving all residents in El Salvador access to a small amount of bitcoin.

In other news the failing U.S. administration is not taking well, people across the U.S.A. appear to be rejecting the ""infrastructure bill"" that would (if passed into law) literally cut the country's GDP in half while also wiping out opportunities for crypto innovation in the USA, and most people are broadly opposed to basically everything that's in the bill:

They're introducing a way to encourage people to use their BTC and increase adoption. They started by giving it away. A lot of people will figure ""let's just turn this in to fiat"" so they put restrictions on its use to start.  Then people are incentivized to enter the ecosystem.

This next step incentivizes them to further keep using BTC for fuel savings.  No one is ""giving their BTC back to the state,"" they are ""paying the state for state supplied commodities using a new state-backed currency.""

I am not defending the integrity of the government nor suggesting there is absolutely nothing wrong with this system.

5720,2021-03-25,"I think those that are scared that they missed out don't understand that most of the people who invested when it was at around $3.000 and waited for it to get up to $10.000 - $11.000 withdrew the money when it hit that big number. A lot less people understood the way crypto worked back then, so it was an actual rush to sell while the person was still in profit, without even imagining it could reach the amount it has now. So, don't worry, such a small number of the people that bought at the lowest point stuck with it to reach $61.000.   


I first bought when it was around $8.500 back in 2018, but just for fun, because as I said I was one of those people that had no idea what it was back then, just that it was growing super fast and magazines were writting about it. I sold when it almost reached $10.000 and that was all. Do I regret not holding on to the little piece that I had? Maybe a bit, as anyone would, but could have I imagined back then the course it will have in 3 years? I don't think so, only if I were some expert, but even then I'm not sure. Anyway, I did what was obvious for me at the time, because what would have been the logic back then to lose the money you invested?  


Fast forward to a few months back, I bought a little sum while it was at around $42.000, so at a high price you could say. What's different this time is my knowledge on the subject, so I don't intend to sell everything I have like I did 3 years ago, even if it means being on the minus side. I'm just interested in being part of the journey and see where it's going from here.  


A few weeks ago I've seen a video on scalping ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F3mdBtygzQ ), that techinique used in forex trading and it seems like an interesting approach to crypto as well. Especially while bitcoin is quite unstable at the moment and unpredictable. I'm still in the free trial of using this terminal https://bittrade.one/ but for now I've been able to avoid some small losses, I think, or at least get a better view on the patterns that the currency follows.

The dynamics of this transition are fascinating to watch because BTC still moves the market, so if whales move their BTC to ETH too quickly and BTC falls the whole market will drop.  But it seems clear that BTC money is transferring to ETH.

I wonder whether this transition could be the catalyst for the next crypto autumn/winter.  At the moment crypto algorithms are programmed to track BTC, so the 60% of trading carried out by computers is still sensitive to BTC price.

When it becomes clearer that the ETH bullrun is happening while BTC is moving sideways or backwards, manual traders will move over to ETH because why would you stay in BTC dropping the BTC price and potentially causing an algorithm induced mega crash.

6069,2021-09-14,"I am prepared for the downvotes, but let's speak TRUTH to what happened.

Solana was NOT SHUTDOWN on a WHIM. It was overloaded! Very similar to a DoS attack. What is a DoS attack? It is when a server is bombarded by requests so that it cannot function. This happens because servers are limited by their hardware. (think of what happens when you try to run a computer game on max graphics on a crappy computer, it becomes so laggy and your computer might even crash.)

The reasons why SOLANA stopped working is because of some DeFi project that was spamming transactions on the main chain. Solana has a max TPS of 46,000. But this DeFi project triggered a bug that was creating transactions past that limit. All the validators failed because of their inability to process the sheer amount of transactions that was occurring because of this bug.

Also think about this logically, why would SOLANA shut down their own network on a whim? That's a nightmare. Also how would that even work? The blockchain has open source code, if this was true, please point to the code that allows this functionality.

I'm not saying this was a NOT a bad event. But SOLANA is in Beta. The dev team of SOLANA has owned up to the bug in their code. It is what it is. Shit goes wrong. People have every reason to sell their SOL because of this issue, it looks bad. It is bad. But they found the bug and they are fixing it.",neutral,0.8684001,51

6269,2022-01-26,"It’s decided about every 10 minutes and the difficulty will adjust up or down to try to keep it at that time allotment. If it takes longer difficulty lowers and if it takes shorter next time it will be harder to solve. A miner is generally more likely to win when the network is smaller (and the network difficulty is lower). The person whose mining setup submits the lowest hash value to solve the equation wins the block. Each mining setup can keep submitting hash values as it calculates them as long as the block is still live (about 10 minutes). Generally the more processing your setup has the more likely you’ll get a lower hash value. This is why people pool together and also why BTC has become a bit of an arms race despite the fact that you used to be able to mine in your browser. If less people had giant mining farms the network difficulty would adjust and people could mine from their laptops again (and it would save a lot of electricity). BTC does not need the massive amount of mining power it has.

Back to your question, let’s say your browser miner happens to calculate an insanely short hash rate, flying in the face of probability. (Remember, technically you could flip a fair coin 100 times and get heads every time, it would just be very abnormal). If this happens and no one else’s setup submits a better hash value the browser miner wins the block reward! Right now that is 6.25 Bitcoin plus any transaction fees occurring on the block you’ve just mined.",positive,0.6596219,10

Does that not depend on what you are trying to accomplish?  And to make money is not an acceptable answer.

How does ""Government"" feel about abortion rights or gun control?  Or social welfare programs? Or this war, or that conflict? Turns out there's more than one ""Government""!  And even schisms within each ""Government"".

One government bans all crypto outright while another unilaterally ""buys the dip"" completely agnostic to the will of the governed.  Another still issues grants and funds initiatives to leverage crypto to ensure data security while protecting the privacy of its citizens.  Many more will deputize VCs and gatekeepers the same way that they deputized data-center operators and monopolistic tech firms for the past 3 decades for the express purpose of surveillance and control.

The dumbest among us have succumb to the increasingly intentional, concerted efforts to propagate the ill-considered, unthoughtful, over-simplified sentiment: ""government bad"".

Government can be bad, and will always become bad left to it's own devices, much as how naked iron must become rust when exposed to oxygen.  We don't declare: ""iron bad"".  We iterate, we innovate.  We select for the properties we want and supplement where they are weak.

No the government is the one ripping them off, the point of forcing you to use their paper currency is so they can print more to indirectly steal your wealth.

https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/2023891/lightnet-aims-to-break-barriers

>Lightnet raised $31.2 million in Series A funding from large Asian financial institutions including UOB Ventures and Seven Bank. It has 10 bank partners, with Siam Commercial Bank its largest Thai partner.

>...Lightnet will soon have its first transaction from a 7-Eleven store, likely a money transfer between Japan and Taiwan.

>The company is waiting for the Bank of Thailand to issue a licence to 7-Eleven Thailand, owned by a CP Group subsidiary, to allow customers to make remittance payments at the convenience stores.

Note: their first transaction already occurred late last year, announced via Lightnet's partner Velo Labs

And each transaction removes a predictable 0.00001 XLM from circulation and locks it into a currently inaccessible account (inaccessible unless the network votes on a protocol upgrade that does so...we can discuss the history of that if you want, but for the foreseeable future, they are unreachable).

No more XLM will be created, though there is a large supply held by Stellar Development Foundation. There are specific goals that this amount is earmarked for, such as distribution to large scale adoption initiatives like Velo Labs, Circle (I assume), Abra, SatoshiPay, Ukraine (I assume), etc.

6984,2021-10-22,"After almost a whole year of working on this project, I am so proud to say that it is finally complete! I’ve created an ultimate, all in one, LED ticker that can display all kinds of information! This project was highly inspired by my visit to Times Square NYC. Seeing all the giant billboards was so exciting and fun to watch. I wanted to recreate that atmosphere in my own home so I decided to start this project!

  
As of now, the ticker can display real time stock, crypto, forex prices, news headlines, sports games, weather info, daily forecasts, custom images, GIFs and messages. All these features can be controlled via a custom made web server using Flask (simple GET and POST requests). The main display mode is the old school style scrolling ticker but there is also another option to split the display into two rows, and display different features simultaneously (as you can see in the last part of the video).

  
While I say it’s complete, of course there are plenty of things I want to add in the future. After all, the things you can make with the Raspberry Pi are endless!

Ethereum is very healthy as we see the implementation for EIP-1559 finalised for July via conference call on the weekend past, this upgrade will transition out of the high gas fees to a system of eth fees being burnt in the network- literally burning eth- thus causing it to become a semi/ or entirely deflationary asset, from an economics standpoint this comes with words of caution as deflationary assets can become a horded and protected asset thus stifling the economy, however in the crypto economy this is fantastic- Bitcoin is considered deflationary as a point of reference. 
This is fantastic news for the future value of ethereum. 

However, with that said, the mining community is furious as they will no longer receive their average rewards of 3 ETH per block they transact, there is varying sentiment in the community, with the more extreme and disgruntled attempting to organise a systematic strike of sorts for April 1 in response to the developers decision. 

While this group represents a select few in the community, it represents the loudest, as we have seen in crypto buy the rumour sell the news, in this case we have the inverse situation. And might be able to expect some fantastic buying opportunities with ethereum as April approaches. 

My personal inkling is the miners will make a lot of noise, but fail miserably to consolidate any where close to the required hashing power to evidence to the eth developers and team alike that they pose any threat. It is also highly illogical to do so as it represents semi-centralisation and it is entirely inimical to the network they support. 

In summary, I believe it is very small minority of the mining community, making a lot of noise, and the transition should occur without issue.

That why we plan ahead, we know hey don't invest all that money in equipment we only have X long to mine for and we will lose money.

All the hate for miners is rediculus. You know what else would lower the fees? How about we hyper inflate ETH by 10* x the block rewards? This would lower fees way more then 1559.. no? Why? Because you care about your holdings, what happened to putting the chain first? You put money into ETH with the expectations certain rules would be upheld.

7447,2021-05-01,"Ladies and gentlemen. Boys and girls. Salt and pepper. 

Story time: so nearly three years ago (end of May 2018), I invested NZD $10,000 into the Top 50 cryptos as shown on Coin Market Cap, with the intention of holding until... well, until some time in the future. However, my chronically weak hands lead me to sell it all off a few months into the experiment. Like an absolute idiot, I know (or was I? Read on...) . 

But I've had a few people recently ask how I'm doing, so I've re-drawn the table of my results, and it shows how I would be doing if my hands were made of diamond instead of weak, pathetic flesh & bones. 

Here's a bit of a breakdown: 

Overall, we’re up 230%. 

Top Gainers: 1st - Doge (6500%), 2nd - Binance (3940%), 3rd - Bitcoin (530%)

As you’d expect, Dogecoin has (inexplicably) by far and away taken first place, up an incredible 6,500%. If you’d have told me this back in 2018, I would have laughed in your face but then secretly bought more behind your back. Second is BNB, at nearly 4,000%. Also incredible. And third, our old faithful friend, Bitcoin, at just over 500%.

If we take away these three outliers, and calculate the rest of the results, I’m only up $1,200, which just covers a modest 3% per annum inflation rate of the dollar. The majority of what I’ve tracked have lost close to, or more than half their value which is crazy. This clearly shows the importance of research for each coin or token you invest in, and the importance of knowing when to get out - especially if you’re doing so with the intention of turning a profit. All but six of the tracked cryptos have dropped down the CMC ladder, as all these fancy new coins have arrived on the scene. 

But, you say, a 230% return seems great, right? Consider though, my friends and lovers, the combined market cap is up 665%, so the market has outplayed us. However, we have won against the traditional investors, in that the S&P 500 is up a mere 160% over the same period (that said, Tesla is up 1,300% so take from this what you will). 

In the end, I’m glad I sold up so early, but it is interesting to look back and see all these weird altcoins that never quite made it... RIP (rest in profit). 

I personally still hold a bunch of coins & tokens mentioned on this list, all thankfully in the green (for now, I suppose).

This project has a real life utility and is something trully amazing.  
  
  
  
The Science DAO solves several problems for retail investors, institutions, and inventors. Profound scientific startups are generally not available to the public due to high barriers of entry and non existent deal flow; geography and accreditation sometimes present issues as well. For institutions, many early stage funds deal with an illiquid seed investment in which they are married to a company for many years before any liquidity event. Inventors with promising ideas are in need of expert advice, mentorship, licensing or corporate guidance, and lastly risk capital prior to proof of concept. The Science DAO will enable crypto investors to put their crypto value into a new asset. It will help funds gain access to new deal flow with the opinion of experts in those related industries without having to seek consultation. It would foster growth for inventors and entrepreneurs that are still in need for risk capital. It would take the pressure off single investors by mitigating risk through decentralized governance and fundraising.  
  
  
  
Don't miss out on this project as it will be HUGE!

[Note: this isn’t knocking Monero. Monero is awesome. Just not using the latest tech, y’know?] 

And it adds another layer of security (security-in-depth) by using Intel SGX secure enclaves. Another big difference: it uses a Stellar-based consensus protocol rather than Monero’s PoW, which obviously makes it a lot more performant and scalable. (But also less decentralized, of course... the classic tradeoff.)

So, basically a more cutting-edge reimplementation of Monero with another layer of security, and more performant and scalable, but less decentralized.

It’s really cool stuff, but I really wish they had given Monero more credit. It was kinda asshole-y of them to pointedly credit CryptoNote rather than Monero. I’m guessing they didn’t want to be associated with Monero for regulatory reasons.

The author is happy to provide multi page discussions, perl code and an appendix of how a playing card based cypher works but gives absolutely no clue how his gold backed cryptocurrency works.

The ETH community needs to decide if they want a decentralized store of value, a cheaply tradeable currency, a centralized store of value, an NFT infrastructure or a zillion other things.

Btc went through this maturation phase. It wanted to be a money, and IOT platform, a new internet, an astronaut and a Disney Princess before it settled on digital gold.

Early NFT Confusion:

It's sad but true, early nft sellers didn't realize they were selling the rights to themselves and their decendants via virtual contracts. This accidental nft slave family was bought for the low price of 1m dollars and used to plow fields for the rest of his and his children's lives going on for fifteen generations. One of the best investments of history for returns over generations. At first disregarded as money laundering and jpeg ownerships, later courts ruled the nft contracts were legal binding contracts and proof of sale of pictured item and likeness. This man refused to answer questions after his court ruling and his wife's boyfriend also agreed that he was indeed one dumb ape.

During the bull market people just throw money at everything and a lot of it actually sticks and makes them more money.

It's all just for shits n giggles. Same as shitcoins/memecoins.

Everybody knows it's a sandcastle built on nothing. But everybody wants to get in and out before the castle falls apart.

That's not money laundering. It's more like gambling

The US convinced everyone to stick to gold standard and follow it as the new world leader in the 1940s. 

As much as I would like to think of a world economy based on Bitcoin for global exchange, it would take something like a unilaterally backed AI program to keep things running smoothly. It would constantly have to factor the global GDP vs assets on hand vs Bitcoin in circulation to determine a fair price to every currency, and every government would have to agree to follow it.

The article claims the USD has lost 98% of isn't value over the last 100 years. This shows a fundamental misunderstsnding of how currency actually us used. Over the last 2.5 years of global stress testing all currencies, the USD has dominated. Check out the DXY for a citation of that. Cash isn't designed to be a store of value over 100 years. The argument the author makes is a strawman.

Also, whether or not they are moderating the business cycle well enough is completely subjective and  hypothetical. The counter-factual argument around the mishandling the pandemic by increasing the money supply is easy to criticize and would have also been arguably even more impactful. Often spending more on the front end of these types of disasters pays off and being able to manipulate the supply of money is a feature of the economy.

But to say the FED has failed in EVERYTHING they have set out to accomplish is silly... who is it doing better on the scale and with the use cases of the USD? Nobody of course.",neutral,0.63408244,1

Brazil simply expanded existing regulatory frameworks to also include ""payment systems"" like virtual currencies and corporate coupon points like frequent flyer miles, that some people treat like commodities that have also been vectors for fraud and exploitation.

The European Central Bank just [issued this statement today](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/blog/date/2022/html/ecb.blog221130%7E5301eecd19.en.html)

>**Regulation can be misunderstood as approval**

>Large investors also fund lobbyists who push their case with lawmakers and regulators. In the US alone, the number of crypto lobbyists has almost tripled from 115 in 2018 to 320 in 2021. Their names sometimes read like a who's who of US regulators.

>But lobbying activities need a sounding board to have an impact. Indeed, lawmakers have sometimes facilitated the influx of funds by supporting the supposed merits of Bitcoin and offering regulation that gave the impression that crypto assets are just another asset class. Yet the risks of crypto assets are undisputed among regulators. In July, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) called for crypto assets and markets to be subject to effective regulation and supervision commensurate with the risks they pose - along the doctrine of ""same risk, same regulation"". 

In short, countries like Brazil are not endorsing crypto.  Not at all.

Memecoins have kinda been around ever since altcoins became a thing.
In the beginning the crypto space was filled with people that had more then half a brain thus memecoins, that are on paper even worse then scamcoins, didn't get much of a podium.

Now that more dumbmoney is flocking into crypto; these type of investors can only understand memes and for all they know a token on BSC is the same as a coin that is being mined and is decentralised.

 I know the term Web 3.0 is cringy, but it fits.  Web 1.0 was static web pages, back in the 90s.  I had one.  I wrote my html by hand in a text editor.  Web 2.0 was user generated content, like facebook and instagram, but also blogging and the many forms of modern information sharing.  We all use it now and we take it for granted.  Web 3.0 is all about data, and someday, things like proof of work & proof of stake blockchains (and other forms?) will be so commonplace that people will take them for granted just as we take email for granted today.

> Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer digital currency that can be transferred via the bitcoin network. Bitcoin transactions are cryptographically verified by network nodes and recorded in a public distributed ledger known as a blockchain. The cryptocurrency was created in 2008 by an unknown individual or group of individuals using the alias Satoshi Nakamoto. ([1](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf))

> 
> **It's Decentralized**
> 
> * Decentralization is the process through which an organization's operations are disseminated or delegated away from a central, authoritative location or group, specifically those related to decision-making and planning ([2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#Decentralization)). One of the core assets of Bitcoin is that it is decentralized meaning:
> 
> 1. No need for a central authority
> 2. No need for centralized servers (peer to peer network)
> 3. Ledger is distributed and public
> 4. Anyone can be a bitcoin miner
> 5. Anyone can create a bitcoin address
> 6. Anyone can do a transaction without needing approval from a centralized source
> 
> **Provides Privacy**
> 
> * Bitcoin is a pseudonymous currency, which means that funds are not connected to real-world entities but rather to bitcoin addresses. If you were to own a bitcoin address, there would be no known connection between your identity and that of the address but all transactions will be public. Although it is possible (but hardly) that bad actors may identify your address via correlating the transactions you made, you can increase privacy by creating another address.
> 
> **Security**
> 
> * Bitcoin operates through what is called a Proof of Work algorithm which is a type of cryptographic proof in which one party (the prover) demonstrates to others (the verifiers) that a specific amount of computational effort has been expended. In Bitcoin, miners compete to append blocks and mint new currency, each miner experiencing a success probability proportional to the computational effort expended. Miners in Bitcoin are tasked to validate a transaction by solving a complex problem. The total combined total computational power of these miners combines is what's called a Hashrate. The hashrate is an important metric for assessing the security of the network. The more machines dedicated to discovering the next block by honest miners, the higher the hashrate rises and the more difficult it becomes for malicious agents to disrupt the network. ([3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_work), [4](https://etherplan.com/2020/03/21/why-proof-of-work-based-nakamoto-consensus-is-secure-and-complete/10509/), [5](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/02/05/what-does-hashrate-mean-and-why-does-it-matter/))
> 
> **Scarcity**
> 
> * There will only be 21 million Bitcoins in existence, once all of Bitcoin has been mined there will no more issuance of new Bitcoins and this give it this certain trait of scarcity like precious metals without the difficulty of portability and also the same traits of durability. ([5](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/100314/why-do-bitcoins-have-value.asp), [6](https://www.investopedia.com/tech/what-happens-bitcoin-after-21-million-mined/))
> 
> **The Coin that Started it All**
> 
> * By this time everybody knows why and how Bitcoin, how it's mysterious maker just vanished from the scene and how it's purpose still echoes as a reminder that power of self-custody is never too late to remove ourselves from being too dependent of centralized bodies that often times go beyond what we allow them to do. To this day, Bitcoin still stands as number one coin (by marketcap) and will probably stay that way for a very long time.

> **Early Buyers have the Higher Ground.**
> 
> * Those who bought BTC in it's early years have a great advantage over the recent ones. One thing is that they won't have to worry much about it's price dropping now since they're still much likely in the green in terms of percentage gains. Most of these early investors are also capable of manipulating the market via wash trades not giving the true traded volume within the market and thus deceiving most novice traders/investors into believing fake signals ([2](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-24/bitcoin-manipulation-is-said-to-be-focus-of-u-s-criminal-probe), [3](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-regulators-demand-trading-data-from-bitcoin-exchanges-in-manipulation-probe-2018-06-08)). There is even a possibility that Satoshi Nakamoto himself/herself/themselves will suddenly access the wallet he/she/they own/s and proceed to sell the large amount of BTC they have which would greatly cause a crash in Bitcoin's price.
> 
> **Attracts Illegal Transactions and Criminal Activities**
> 
> * Bitcoin's innate trait of being publicly available and pseudonymous not only attracts those who seek independence but it also attracts those engage in illicit activities and perform illegal transactions. This is one of the downsides of giving back the power of choice to people, not all of them will do the morally right thing to do and as a result, economist, lawyers, and even countries will label Bitcoin as just another medium for buying/selling illegal goods/services.

> **It still Affects the Environment**
> 
> * Bitcoin accounts 0.1% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions this year. The waste from it's parts also affect the environment as it's equipment only last an average of 1.3 years, especially, ASICS that aren't really reusable after their expected wear and tear. Although efforts have been made to address this energy and waste problem such as using green energy for Bitcoin mining, there is still a need to further improve this so as to avoid future problems in the environment ([10](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/sep/17/waste-from-one-bitcoin-transaction-like-binning-two-iphones), [11](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-58572385), [12](https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-electronic-waste-monitor/), [13](https://www.business-standard.com/article/international/going-green-how-to-ditch-fossil-fuels-powering-the-bitcoin-network-122042100219_1.html), [14](https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/insight/2022/a-deep-dive-into-bitcoins-environmental-impact/), [15](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9385063)). Regardless with how small its effects are compared to other industries, it still should be a unified act to preserve the environment for as long as humanly possible for the future of humans and the world itself.
> 
> **The Requirement of Being Responsible and Disciplined**
> 
> * The constant triple-checking of addresses making sure that it's yours and not some dead end address or the fact that you need to keep your passphrase safe physically and never keep them in any device connected to the internet as to avoid any possible hacks/scams. The decentralization that Bitcoin gives you the freedom to finally be your own bank, but it comes at a cost. You need to be responsible and disciplined enough because unlike traditional banks, being your own bank doesn't give you any protection or safety nets like FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other deposit insurance corporation) when things go south.

If we are lucky and everyone sells grossly in the same period of time i'm guessing it could be very good for the sales price as well.

Now, I'm gonna speculate even more and say that btc will probably be less affected by the crash. I'm mostly in btc/eth/iota {well I had to start again because I cashed out everything a few months ago}. I bought miota at 0.6 a month ago it is now at 1.5 if i am not mistaking. I'd say if you start investing with the stimulus check, you'll probably go for the cheapest option. I'm thinking iota will tank more than btc or eth. All in all, if btc could lose 10k this would be extremely good but I'm not sure it will go that low? Eth i could see it going under the 1000 euros mark, I'm not sure. I'm just sure iota is gonna go under 1 again.

Then again, last year's crash was pretty beautiful to watch so who knows, I'm keeping my hopes down so I'm not disappointed.

But btc is like a money printing machine at this point, you put money in btc and take it back even a few hours later you're almost 100% sure of making profits, this is due a massive correction",neutral,0.461212,6

There are a variety of ""attestations"" they've done over time.  It's important to note that these are not audits.  They don't identify the source of the money, how long it's been there, etc.. they just say, ""x amount is in account y as of date z"" - so the cash may not even be owned by Tether and just moved into the account in preparation for the attestation.   Even so, their earliest attestation showed about 3% in cash, then 7%, and the latest claims approx 12% in ""cash and bank deposits"" but that's all that's known.  It can't even be verified that this cash actually belongs to them.  They've been moving money back and forth between their reserve accounts and the working accounts of their sister company, Bitfinex.   The whole thing is one shady mess.

NOTE - that every criticism you can levy against Tether, can also be said for other stablecoins like USDC/Circle.  They too, have been doing attestations in lieu of actual full, formal audits - the latter of which is the industry standard that all banks have to submit to.  The fact that these entities refuse to submit to formal audits is basically all you need to know.

After all, what would happen if America cut off access to SWIFT for the more than 400 Russian institutions that use the global payment system? Russia cannot close the door to an open payment system like Bitcoin that is not controlled by anyone.

Russia is also well aware that a race to the Hash Rate is launched and that if America dominates, it can play an important role because of its energy assets.

So Russia is choosing the most pragmatic path here by deciding to treat Bitcoin as a foreign currency in order to take advantage of this monetary revolution.

Game theory is in full play here, and we'll have to see how America reacts in the future if Russia goes further in its adoption of Bitcoin.

> Federal Reserve officials won&#039;t be able to trade a slew of assets including stocks and bonds - as well as cryptocurrencies - under new rules that became formal Friday.

> Central bank officials acted after disclosures last year that several senior Fed officials had been trading individual stocks and stock funds just before the time the central bank adopted sweeping measures aimed at boosting the economy in the early days of the Covid spread. Regional presidents Eric Rosengren of Boston and Robert Kaplan left their positions following the controversy.

> Under the regulations, officials still holding market positions will still have 12 months to shed prohibited positions.

5 - Ada will be on Coinbase, our aunts and uncles can buy.

6 - Ada will be on PayPal, millions of users.

8 - Goguen smart contracts, lots of dapps going to be built on Cardano.

9 - Ouroboros Omega (self healing against 51% attack!!! just wow).

10 - Grayscale institutional investors $$$$$$$$.

First:""A Wells notice is the official way a regulator tells a company that it intends to sue the company in court."" 
Actually, a Wells notice is an SEC-specific process. Not all agencies have such a process, and it has another name if they do (NORA for CFPB). 2/

Not a material error, but it shows that the blog post wasn't vetted by someone with a lot of experience. 3/

But then there's the biggie: 
""They have only told us that they are assessing our Lend product through the prism of decades-old Supreme Court cases called Howey and Reves...These two cases are from 1946 and 1990."" 4/

I get that 1990 seems like the dark ages to crypto bros, but there's a reason these cases have stood the test of time. They are a cornerstone of SecReg 101 and shouldn't surprise anyone. Whinging about them is not a good look for a public company. 5/

Grewal continues: ""Formal guidance from the SEC about how they intend to apply Howey and Reves tests to products like Lend would be a big help to regulating our industry in a responsible way."" 6/

Um no. There's absolutely nothing about Coinbase's Lend product that is crypto-specific. It's just an old fashioned investment contract:  you give us your money to play around with now, and we'll promise to give you 4% APY later. 7/

The SEC doesn't have the obligation (or the resources) to issue guidance about things that should be obvious to a baby securities lawyer. It's really astounding that Coinbase thinks its entitled to anything more. 8/

It also shows that Coinbase doesn't understand the Wells process. A Wells hearing is when Coinbase gets its chance to make its case to the SEC to explain why the SEC has it all wrong. Only if it fails to meet its burden will the SEC sue. 9/

But Coinbase seems to think that it's entitled to at least an extra round of formal process beyond the Wells process. That's not how it works. 10/

I'll just say this:  ""Is there a securities lawyer on this flight?""  Because it sure as hell looks like there isn't.  11/11

I don't live in New York anymore, and I don't miss the BitLicense. But I still appreciate Coinbase for all they do in terms of regulative up-frontness! I tried to trade my STX tokens anywhere for literally years after the SEC approved the Stacks ICO, the first ICO of its kind to be approved, and later after the Stacks ecosystem received clarity about how they could consider their STX tokens as ""not securities"" anymore.

This meant that US people could trade them and it would be legal. For a solid year after the SEC approved the ICO, it was not possible to trade these ICO tokens that you had bought legally, except via private (1-on-1) personal exchanges, because of regulatory hurdles. (Because crypto exchanges universally, across the board, all aren't licensed for securities trading.) This is also somehow only a problem for US citizens and residents, there were lots of places you can trade STX, deposit and withdraw, but so long as it remained listed as a security, there were seemingly none who would actually process your trade if your IP was in the US, because of the SEC.

The field of land-mines around this touchy area with respect to US regulatory authorities meant that there was nowhere. Not one exchange. Not even one! Where I could trade those tokens on launch day of Stacks 2.0, after all that effort from STX to comply, and receiving regulatory approval, and securities de-listing and re-classification, Stacks' only US launch partner had hazy coverage of some states, and my state was on the ""no-go"" list. We're not an especially big or heavy regulatory state. No idea why.

> **First-Mover Advantage and The Network Effect**
> 
> Bitcoin is currently the most popular cryptocurrency and market cap leader by a long shot. The [Bitcoin dominance chart](https://www.coingecko.com/en/global-charts) shows that Bitcoin represents 60% of the entire cryptocurrency market cap. This has increased from 40% in 2020.
> 
> Bitcoin is the **gateway**. People start out with Bitcoin before checking out other cryptocurrencies. They're likely going to keep holding any Bitcoin they bought along the way.
> 
> People will flock to whichever product has the largest user base. For half a decade, Bitcoin was almost synonymous with cryptocurrency. The Network Effect creates a **positive feedback loop** and makes Bitcoin's lead grow even more.
> 
> If Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin were all released simultaneously, Bitcoin would lose to its PoW competitors because its competitors have cheaper fees with higher throughput. But the reality is that Bitcoin's first-mover advantage gave it such a huge head start that the others can't catch up.
> 
> **Has the largest block reward for security**
> 
> Due to its high price, Bitcoin has a huge [block reward of 6.5 BTC](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin/bitcoin-halving) (halves every 4 years) or ~$180k per block. This gives it the security lead because its block reward is so much bigger than other PoW cryptocurrencies, which attracts more miners.
> 
> **Anti-censorship**
> 
> Bitcoin provides partial censorship-resistance against sanctions and totalitarian government restrictions. It's much harder to prevent Bitcoin transactions than it is to prevent financial transactions at a centralized bank. [Legal sex workers](https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/24/22639356/onlyfans-ceo-tim-stokely-sexually-explicit-content-ban-banks) (e.g. Onlyfans) and [marijuana industries](https://www.leadingretirement.com/blog/cannabis-banking) are blocked from using traditional financial services due to social stigma. Even though they can operate legally, many TradFi banks avoid operating with them. Bitcoin provides those workers a way to transfer funds around that censorship.
> 
> **Avoids Hyperinflation**: As long as governments keep causing high inflation through money-printing, people will run to Bitcoin for safety, which pumps up Bitcoin's price.
> 
> **Considered a commodity by both SEC and CFTC**: Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency that both the SEC and CFTC have openly agreed is a commodity. And the CFTC is much less lawsuit-happy than the SEC.
> 
> **Legal tender**: El Salvador has shown (despite some technical mishaps) that Bitcoin can be successfully used as legal tender for a country.
> 
> **Ordinals provide utility**
> 
> Even though Bitcoin Maxis hate Ordinals, this new protocol gives utility to Bitcoin and adds demand. NFT bros are using it as an **on-chain data storage layer** for their own blockchains (e.g. Ethereum, Stack). This has an advantage over IPFS since IPFS is stored in centralized databases instead of on-chain.
> 
> This generates more fees for Bitcoin miners. Transaction fees have finally [risen to ~20 sats/vByte](https://mempool.space/graphs/mempool) on days with high Ordinals activity like Mar 22-24. This gives hope that there may be sufficient demand for Bitcoin as an on-chain data-storage layer even after the block subsidy eventually disappears due to halvings.
> 
> **Pseudonymous**: Bitcoin's UTXO transactions can provide moderately-high levels of obscurity. A single wallet can produce a near-unlimited amount of addresses, and there's no way to link them unless they interact with each other. It's much harder to trace UTXO-based wallets than Account-based wallets because the former creates new UTXO addresses with each transaction while Account-based blockchain wallets typically reuse the same account.
> 
> **Lightning transactions are near-instant and cheap**
> 
> As long as you're spending small amounts of Bitcoin, you can use the Lightning network to make near-instant, sub-$0.01 transactions. Many Lightning nodes for merchants are connected to 3rd-party services that convert between cash and Lightning, making it easy to transfer Bitcoins. Consumers usually don't have to care about rebalancing issues since they're only spending small amounts.
> 
> And the [total capacity of the Lightning Network](https://bitcoinvisuals.com/ln-capacity) in BTC keeps increasing steadily.
> 
> **Cannot be counterfeited**: Cash can be counterfeited, but you can't fake Lightning transactions. Merchants have to deal with counterfeit cash in many markets around the world.
> 
> **Bitcoin has a very strong community of die-hard supporters**
> 
> A huge portion of Bitcoin supporters have become Bitcoin Maxis who will keep spreading their arguments, regardless of accuracy. Because Bitcoin is a gateway cryptocurrency, crypto newbies will encounter it first and gobble up these narratives because they don't have the experience to know their flaws. And they're very convincing when you keep repeating them in an echo chamber:
> 
> * Maximum supply cap of 21M BTC vs Fed's money printer
> * Amazing past-performance gains vs fiat
> * Works as Store of Value (despite volatility)
> * Had a ""fair launch"" without an ICO
> * Is not a risky altcoin
> * Is decentralized (based on largest number of miners)
> * Has instant payments via the Lightning Network
> 
> **Ultimately, people are mainly using crypto for speculative investing and long-term Store of Value. Most people don't care about technology, Defi, or utility. Thus Bitcoin is sufficient for their investment needs.**
> 
> And since cryptocurrency value is largely based on a Keynesian Beauty Contest (i.e. you buy not based on your own value, but on what you think others are going to buy), people are going to keep buying Bitcoin as long as the investment narrative holds.

> Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer digital currency that can be transferred via the bitcoin network.

> **Early Buyers have the Higher Ground.**
> 
> * Those who bought BTC in it's early years have a great advantage over the recent ones. One thing is that they won't have to worry much about it's price dropping now since they're still much likely in the green in terms of percentage gains. Most of these early investors are also capable of manipulating the market via wash trades not giving the true traded volume within the market and thus deceiving most novice traders/investors into believing fake signals ([2](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-24/bitcoin-manipulation-is-said-to-be-focus-of-u-s-criminal-probe), [3](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-regulators-demand-trading-data-from-bitcoin-exchanges-in-manipulation-probe-2018-06-08)). There is even a possibility that Satoshi Nakamoto himself/herself/themselves will suddenly access the wallet he/she/they own/s and proceed to sell the large amount of BTC they have which would greatly cause a crash in Bitcoin's price.
> 
> **Attracts Illegal Transactions and Criminal Activities**
> 
> * Bitcoin's innate trait of being publicly available and pseudonymous not only attracts those who seek independence but it also attracts those engage in illicit activities and perform illegal transactions. This is one of the downsides of giving back the power of choice to people, not all of them will do the morally right thing to do and as a result, economist, lawyers, and even countries will label Bitcoin as just another medium for buying/selling illegal goods/services.

> **It still Affects the Environment**
> 
> * Bitcoin accounts 0.1% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions this year. The waste from it's parts also affect the environment as it's equipment only last an average of 1.3 years, especially, ASICS that aren't really reusable after their expected wear and tear. Although efforts have been made to address this energy and waste problem such as using green energy for Bitcoin mining, there is still a need to further improve this so as to avoid future problems in the environment ([10](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/sep/17/waste-from-one-bitcoin-transaction-like-binning-two-iphones), [11](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-58572385), [12](https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-electronic-waste-monitor/), [13](https://www.business-standard.com/article/international/going-green-how-to-ditch-fossil-fuels-powering-the-bitcoin-network-122042100219_1.html), [14](https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/insight/2022/a-deep-dive-into-bitcoins-environmental-impact/), [15](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9385063)). Regardless with how small its effects are compared to other industries, it still should be a unified act to preserve the environment for as long as humanly possible for the future of humans and the world itself.

> **The Requirement of Being Responsible and Disciplined**
> 
> * The constant triple-checking of addresses making sure that it's yours and not some dead end address or the fact that you need to keep your passphrase safe physically and never keep them in any device connected to the internet as to avoid any possible hacks/scams. The decentralization that Bitcoin gives you the freedom to finally be your own bank, but it comes at a cost. You need to be responsible and disciplined enough because unlike traditional banks, being your own bank doesn't give you any protection or safety nets like FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other deposit insurance corporation) when things go south.

People like to say how [""""history will repeat""""](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BLX/QjPAbstD-The-Death-Of-Bitcoin-Cycles/). That's not really the case. It rhymes at best, BUT it's not possible to tell exactly what period we are rhyming with and not insert your own bias with that selection. You could throw ANY chunk of price action onto this chart and pretend that is what will happen next. If you take Bear Markets with <50% correlation, you find that we are actually due for a rally over the next 1-2 months on average. Which is in line with my latest Elliott Wave count.

This system is flawed and cannot be fixed. Its original sin is obviously the ability given to a minority of unrepresentative people to print as much fiat money out of thin air as they deem necessary.

The superior characteristics of Bitcoin were thus highlighted in opposition to this flawed system.

It was in some ways the best marketing campaign for Bitcoin to see the Fed or ECB constantly printing more fiat money.

If passed, the bill introduced on January 25 would make Arizona the first state in the United States to recognize Bitcoin as a legal form of currency officially. The bill has been co-sponsored by other Republican Party leaders from Arizona.

In announcing the bill’s launch, the lawmaker cited a recent report by banking giant Goldman Sachs indicating that Bitcoin is the best-performing asset in 2023.

Below is an argument written by Laughingboy14 which won 3rd place in the Regulation Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

> Crypto is currently a lawless wild west. In the last year alone, we have seen Luna's spectacular collapse, multiple bankruptcies, and countless scams. This, among other reasons, is a product of a lack of regulation. If anyone can create a project, the project can be entitled anything and promise the world, it leaves the potential for scams and nefarious entities. This ultimately is a hindrance to adoption. The non-crypto-enthusiast sees these scams and lack of regulation and is put off crypto. 
> 
> Note, government regulation does not need to be stifling. Government regulation can be, in the right hands, a needed guiding hand to aid the crypto market. It will provide reassurances to the masses, reduce the number of bad actors in the space, and reduce the chances of you losing your hard earned crypto.

> 
> **The opposite of what crypto stands for**
> 
> Crypto deprives the banks and companies of their authority and gives people the freedom to manage their finances independently. Regulation runs counter to this notion.
> 
> **Negatively affect prices**
> 
> Prices would probably decrease instantly in the short term as a result of tougher control, in part because so many people are afraid of it. In the world of cryptocurrencies, regulation itself has taken on a certain specter. 
> 
> **Kills Innovation**
> 
> The adaptable fundraising models are the reason the sector is flourishing. Companies that use cryptocurrencies have been able to raise money fast without being constrained by onerous security regulations. Additionally, small-scale investors have had access to projects that they otherwise would not have had.

11272,2021-03-23,"That's a good point.

I guess if Month B is a larger dip than the Month A, I could advance my purchase from Month C to buy the dip that happened during month B?

Basically I'll just advance my purchases to make sure I buy during the dips. To make sure I still follow DCA, I'll limit my purchases to 12 purchases in a year so that it will be like I bought BTC ""every month""? What do you think the negative side would be for this one?

I think with this method you are basically removing the ""stress free"" investing that comes with DCA, since you are watching the market for dips. Unlike in the conventional DCA where you just purchase X amount at Y day per month.

Edit1: What you said is correct, we can't time the market. I guess that is one flaw with this method, how do I know the dip I bought into is ""the dip"".  


Edit2: This method is dangerous to do if the market turns bearish since I might buy during dips that I thought was the ""dip""  for that period, and then suddenly the real dip happens.

> Understanding the benefits and drawbacks of the bitcoin blockchain is essential if you're considering investing in bitcoin. Let's start off with the positives of BTC. 
> 
> **21 Million Fixed Supply**
> 
> Bitcoin cannot be printed by governments at will, unlike fiat money like the US dollar. There are only a total of 21 million bitcoins in existence. An estimated 3.7 million bitcoins have been lost, which means they will never be found without the private key. Citizens all over the world are using bitcoin as an inflation hedge due to the continued money creation by central banks around the world.
> 
> **Decentralization**
> 
> The ability to conduct financial transactions without a third-party intermediary watching over the transaction is referred to as decentralization. The nodes, or individual computers that make up the Bitcoin network, are numerous. Decentralization is crucial because it precludes an attack on a single point of failure, making it nearly impossible for any government or organization to bring down the BTC network.
> 
> **25/7/365**
> 
> Bitcoin doesn't have afternoon or weekend closing times like conventional financial markets do. Bitcoin can be traded 365 days a year, around the clock. Furthermore, sending bitcoin is quicker than making a bank transfer. The Bitcoin network is accessible to everyone. It is an open peer-to-peer network that everyone can utilize, regardless of where they reside or how much money they have.
> 
> **Self Custody**
> 
> Self-custody is vital for cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. You don't have to rely on a single corporation, a bank, or legal documents to acquire full ownership of your possessions. In nations around the world with weak property rights, this has a huge impact and gives people more power and control over their finances.

Below is an argument written by Maleficent_Plankton which won 1st place in the Bitcoin Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

> ##CONs
> 
> ####**Intro**
> 
> Overall, Bitcoin's conservative blockchain has failed to keep up with other blockchains technology-wise, which have evolved features and efficiencies way beyond Bitcoin. If all the cryptocurrencies were re-released today simultaneously, it is very unlikely Bitcoin would make it into the top 100 by market cap. It's currently #1 because it had a first-mover advantage and has enjoyed the network effect.
> 
> ####**Much too slow**
> 
> Bitcoin is now a **[3 TPS](https://blockchair.com/bitcoin)** blockchain with a **30-60 minute probabilistic finality**. It used to have a maximum of 7 TPS, but that has gradually fallen over the years after the Segwit update. It's much too slow to be used for point-of-sales merchant transactions. No one is ever going to want to **wait 30-60+ minutes** at cash register for a transaction to go through that's not even guaranteed to succeed. Block times average 10 minutes, but they are very variable. 14% of blocks take longer than 20 minutes, and 5% are longer than 30 minutes [[Source](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/25293/probablity-distribution-of-mining/43592#43592)], causing stress for those waiting for confirmation, let alone finality. Some transactions get stuck in the mempool for weeks when there's congestion.
> 
> **Competition**: It's orders of magnitude slower than newer networks like Avalanche's X-Chain and Algorand, which can process 4000+ TPS with sub-5s of deterministic finality, with transaction fees under a penny.
> 
> Competition from Traditional Finance has also skyrocketed as payment systems like M-Pesa in Africa, UK's Faster Payments, Australia's NPP, Clearinghouse's RTP now provide near-instant payments and peer-to-peer transactions **without fees**.
> 
> ####**Batch UTXO transactions have scalability limits**
> 
> Some Bitcoin proponents have argued that TPS is a misleading metric due to UTXO batching. However, you can't just increase useful transfers 100x by batching 100x transactions. This is because UTXO addresses take up space, so there is a limit to batched storage savings: ~40% (160 vbytes vs 258 vbytes when batching 2 basic transactions of 3 UTXO each) [[Source](https://blog.coinbase.com/reflections-on-bitcoin-transaction-batching-b13dad12a12)]. **Even if each block were a single batched transaction, Bitcoin would only increase from 3 to 5 effective transfers per second.** Also, this isn't unique to Bitcoin. Account transactions can batch using smart contracts to save fees and space.
> 
> ####**Difficult to achieve widespread global adoption**
> 
> At 3 TPS, Bitcoin can only make ~260K transaction/day. **If Bitcoin grows to the size of 1% of the 8B global population, each person can make an average of 1 on-chain transaction every 300 days.** Imagine 10% of world using Bitcoin, and each person being able to make a single transaction once every 8 years.
> 
> **Not even the Lightning Network could save Bitcoin** because opening and closing a channel requires 2 on-chain transactions. Each Lightning channel has directional capacity, and whenever that gets exceeded, it will need to be closed and reopened with new capacity. You can't expect people to store months of funds on a single channel. Half of the US is living paycheck to paycheck and would unlikely be able to keep channels opened for long periods. If even 1% of the world used the Lightning Network and opens/closes their channels twice a year, the Bitcoin Network would become completely congested.
> 
> ####**Extremely inefficient and wasteful**
> 
> To protect against Sybil and 51% attacks, Bitcoin's PoW consensus achieves greater security through greater **redundancy**. Out of a million miners, only one of them is producing the actual block while the rest of them are just wasting energy and electric waste. Full nodes also hold redundant copies of the blockchain ledger, leading to wasted storage.
> 
> In 2021, each block cost roughly $150-300K in energy to mine, which is equivalent to $100-150 of fees per transaction. **A single Bitcoin transaction uses about the same energy as a typical [US household over 2 months](https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption)**. The total Bitcoin network energy consumption of ~150 TWh/yr is equivalent to [**18-24 US nuclear power plants**](https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/5-fast-facts-about-nuclear-energy). Another way of looking at this is that Bitcoin consumes about as much energy as all datacenters globally [[Source](https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-may-consume-as-much-energy-as-all-data-centers-globally)].
> 
> In comparison, other distributed consensus methods such as BFT are [10^7 x more efficient for energy use](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12599-020-00656-x). There is a silver lining: the energy waste (and security) will slowly decrease with each block subsidy halving, at the cost of decreased security.
> 
> ####**Mining Pool Centralization**
> 
> **The top 3 mining pools own 60% of the network hash rate** [[Source](https://btc.com/stats/pool)]. Individual miners have no financial incentive to run full nodes, so it's rare for them to be auditing their pool operators and won't notice attacks until it's too late. (To prevent miners from stealing block rewards, mining pool servers do not provide enough info to miners for them to be able to see attacks ahead of time.)
> 
> ####**Moderately-high transaction fees**
> 
> Transaction fees have risen over time. Layer 1 transfer fees are currently $1-2 USD and even briefly rose [past $50 in May 2021](https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_average_transaction_fee) during congestion. That's way more than [its competitors](https://blog.nano.org/cryptocurrency-fee-comparison-which-crypto-has-the-lowest-fees-4e9118590e1f) (e.g. XLM, XRP, Nano, BCH) that have average transfer fees under 0.5 US cents.
> 
> Currently, revenue from the transaction fees are only [1-2% of the block rewards](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-fee_to_reward.html). Thus, when the block subsidy eventually disappears, transaction fees would need to be much higher to make up for the subsidy.
> 
> ####**Chance of reorgs and invalidated blocks**
> 
> Bitcoin's PoW has probabilistic finality, and there's always a chance a previous block could be orphaned and invalidated. This is known as a reorg, which is when the previously-longest chain is overtaken by a new longest chain. **There have been at least 2 reorgs longer than 20 blocks**: 51 blocks in Aug 2010 and 24 blocks on Mar 12, 2013 [[Source 1](https://coingeek.com/what-the-fork-happened-to-bitcoin/), [Source 2](https://blog.bitmex.com/bitcoins-consensus-forks/)]. The 2010 reorg actually caused Bitcoin to mint 184.4 billion Bitcoins, way past its 21 million cap. There have also been at least [three 4-block reorgs prior to 2017](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/3343/what-is-the-longest-blockchain-fork-that-has-been-orphaned-to-date). So the typical 3-6 block confirmations are not guaranteed to be safe.
> 
> ####**Possibility of 51% attacks in the future**
> 
> Bitcoin has a long-term economic incentive issue known as the [Tragedy of the Commons](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_Commons), and here is one realistic example of how it could happen. Unlike some smaller PoW networks, Bitcoin lacks finality checkpoints. **It only takes $5-10B of mining equipment to compromise the Bitcoin network**, and this is a drop in a bucket for many billionaires and nation states.
> 
> What's preventing others from attacking Bitcoin isn't the monetary cost but the difficulty of acquiring sufficient mining equipment. But as halvings continue, if the price of Bitcoin doesn't double every 4 years, miners will eventually sell their equipment. Some nation state or billionaire could acquire them at a discount, short Bitcoin, and then 51% attack the network. **All they would have to do is produce empty blocks, and the network would halt.** The brilliant part of this is that producing empty blocks does not break any Bitcoin protocols, so they would still earn the block rewards. (In fact, during several months of 2015-2016, about 10% of blocks were empty due to selfish mining. After all, why bother waiting to package transactions when only 1% of the reward is from transaction fees?)
> 
> ####**Negative-sum investment**
> 
> Stock investments of profitable companies are a positive-sum investments. Investors buy and sell from other investors. In addition, money flows from customers to the company, and then to the investors in the form of capital, stock buybacks, and dividends.
> 
> In contrast, Bitcoin investors pay massive block rewards (subsidy + fees) to miners, so it's negative-sum investment for everyone but miners.
> 
> ####**Transaction Backlog**
> 
> Because of Bitcoin's low throughput, there is often a backlog during busy periods. The backlog, as shown via the [Mempool](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/mempool-count), has gotten as high as 100K+ transactions several times in 2021, which is equivalent to waiting 7-9 hours for settlement on average. Transaction fees for confirmed transactions also rise greatly during these periods.

I mentioned this in my first comment, but I'll say it again here, the extension explicitly DOES NOT require giving access to your Twitter account. Whether you are logged in to Twitter or not, it works the same (minus the sharing aspect, which is a Twitter requirement, not extensions - explained further below). 

If you don't believe me, download the extension, go to incognito, enable to extension to run in incognito, go to Twitter (without logging in) and search any cashtag and hover over it...it will work the same. 

For transparency, where login is required is if you click the ""Share"" button on the preview card, which makes the price preview card into an image for tweeting...now the same reason you can't tweet without logging in, is the same reason you can't share the preview card into a tweet without logging in.

Crypto will be a natural place for criminal activity to operate in until governments have more tools to investigate, track down crypto owners - which they will, in time. It shouldn't be a criticism of cryptocurrency - its a redistribution of criminal enterprise and while it offers a new opportunity, or way of committing certain crimes easier, innovation has been at the heart of every enterprise - legal or criminal - forever so 'new tech makes doing X easier' is no reason to ban X in most cases, rather it is a reason to create obstacles to X or ways to investigate the new tech.",positive,0.905008,4

11817,2021-12-03,"In the 1920s and in many previous decades, gold was the standard international currency, as it contained universal value understood by all nations, banks, and governments. But Ford saw gold as the root of all evil, for it made people voracious, avaricious, and cruel. So, he proposed that a new ""energy currency"" be created and transmitted via airwaves to the world. Many people see this date, 100 years ago today, as the first suggestion of something resembling cryptocurrency, which presently rules alternative currency markets around the world. Ford was prophetic in his prediction.

Henry Ford one of the wealthiest men of his time understood that ""capital""  was the ultimate weapon of ""power"" (at that time it rested in the hands of the controllers of the monetary metal of last resort: gold). 

This was before the weaponization of fiat currency.  Ford never would have dreamed that ""paper"" could be used as a reserve currency of the world (like the US dollar has been since Bretton Woods agreement in the late 1940's). I believe he would have thought that ""paper"" having the same value as gold would be a silly proposition.

His views were spot on if you consider all the wars in the last hundred years were ""simple transactions"" to create profits on loans directed to the engagement of those events.

He matter of factly says that in the article (which is astonishing). Korea, Vietnam, Gulf Wars, etc. now in hindsight were continued with this financial incentive of profits.

Smedley Butler (the late commandant of the Marine Corps) essentially said the same thing in his book ""War is a Racket"" written in the 1930's.

Clever I follow for a while now, their protocol uses an automated interest payment and can give users 11% interest on their tokens every 14 days, It's a lot more than what the banks give you. More people need to know about that one.

Gravis Finance- decentralized exchange for NFTs sounds intrensting, not sure a much future we have in it but it is defiantly an intrensting idea.

Hybrix- they working on building digital assets across multiple blockchains. Unfortunately, today blockchains built on different protocols, making it hard to blockchians to communicate with other blockchains. Hybrix trying to fix it, and combine several blockchains, I think its an issue that needed to be solved before mainstream adoption

12096,2023-02-27,"Block size capped means only 4 tx/second which means transaction fees must increase to replace block reward as Bitcoin reward halves every x years, essentially making it so only criminals and the ultra rich will use it, and unnecessarily increasing cost to use. An increased blocksize inversely means more transactions/second and transaction fees stay low as more users use Bitcoin like cash. (Hence the name “Bitcoin cash”) this was the first fork on Bitcoin. The block size cap people took the ticker BTC when they changed the protocol, even though BCH (Bitcoin Cash) stayed true to the original design. Zero conf was a method of instant transactions. BTC’rs stripped it along with the signature blocks to make room for more transactions (still 2mb/s which is basically trying to use dialup to replace Visa/Mastercard) Essentially BTC is a stripped down hobbled version of Bitcoin, which is why no-one uses it anymore in favor of utility coins. Most OG developers migrated from BCH to BSV which is aptly name “Bitcoin Satoshi Vision” because it adheres to the original design of bitcoin as a cash equivalent p2p layer 2 protocol. Check out https://coin.dance/ for usage comparison. BitcoinSV is something like 4,000 times cheaper to use than BTC. Does something around 50k transactions/second on .15% the hash power of BTC.

12419,2022-11-27,"Wow crazy how there's so much pushback to this after PoW advocates assured us that it was totally green and good for the environment!

In market terms, pollution is an [externality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality). Everybody is harmed and the polluter has no economic or legal incentives not to pollute. Pollution and climate change are serious problems, but laws like this to regulate it are too sparse, weak, and costly to enforce. 

The big missing piece is of the puzzle is a Carbon Tax. Yeah I said the T word but bear with me because you would probably actually profit from this system.

A carbon tax taxes the pollutants at their source according to the amount of pollution and harm they are expected to cause. This added cost then affects the rest of the supply chain, making dirtier products and services more expensive which incentivizes greener options. On it's own, that is effective, however it is a regressive tax. To avoid this, we could do something clever [like Canada who redistributes Carbon Tax funds to everyone as a UBI](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/oct/26/canada-passed-a-carbon-tax-that-will-give-most-canadians-more-money).  As you may note from that article, most people actually profit from this system. Meaning, if the carbon tax meant they paid $100 extra that year, the UBI paid them back more than that amount.  Someone who was a top polluter might have had a much more expensive year with the tax, but not fully make up the difference with the UBI payment.

Its a more free (free as in use AND free as in beer) type of opensource license when compared to more restrictive licensee types like the GPL.

12559,2021-01-26,"You don't understand, the license itself is just some text, the phrase ""MIT License"" is short hand for this license type which is just a copy and paste of a license MIT used originally in the 80's.

software developers are not lawyers and open source developers are often running on next to 0 budget. so rather than have a lawyer write up a copyright license that they will issue to users they generally just copy one of the common opensource license types that have been vetted by the industry for years. There are many license types a content author can choose from and they span the range from extremely restrictive to completely loose. The MIT License is on the loose side due to MIT being an educational institution first wanted to license work in a way that allowed their students to share and be free to use what they learned in the real world. 

The MIT License in particular is simply short hand for ""this is my code, you are free to use it as you please with or without attribution and even make money off of it without paying any fees"". The only restriction it has is that any code you take from an MIT licensed project must remain MIT Licensed, you are not allowed to release the work under another license type.

Gas fees average 0.006*2 (0.12) Its better when there is no burn, If you fund the contract with 0.2 BNB and the contract targets another token with high burn fees the contract will basically waste in fees more than make profit. 

I recommend funding the contract with at least 0.4 just to make sure that won't happen. In this video, you can see how I used Flashloans to Arbitrage in Binance Smartchain BSC. We deploy our own contract on BSC to swap between Pancake-Swap and Bakery=Swap. We keep profits in BNB and this can be repeated at times. Higher the volatility, higher profit due to price change.

From my limited understanding of the lightning network, the node operators open a state channel with the Bitcoin network and only have to publish the first and last transaction before closing the channel to the BTC ledger. Again my understanding is limited, but I guess that means the node operator itself would only have to pay two transaction fees to open and close their state channel.  So divide however many transactions are processed on the state channel by your cost to open and close the state channel and you have your OPEX for the node operator. I’d imagine they would have some profit margin for their troubles as well. Again, very new to how this all works. Trying to learn. Could be very wrong.",positive,0.794659,1

The cycle is options expiration.  
https://www.marketwatch.com/tools/options-expiration-calendar   
I've been watching this cycle for 18 months now to time my buy/sells, it's only shafted me in 4 of those months giving it an overall accuracy of ~77%
In general, good buy days are around the 21th of each month and sell days are roughly the 1st week of the month.  

I'm expecting up to 20% drop in the next week based on this cycle. Expiration is this Saturday, 16th. We're currently in expiration week which correlates to the gradual drop that started this past Sunday. The first banking day following expiration day is the 18th, add +3 banking days to account for funds being shuffled around to arrive at the 21st.  

This makes the 22nd the first safe day to semi-accurately make an assessment for the coming month. The best buy days are likely to be 17-18th, but you won't really find out if it was actually a good buy until the 22nd.

13326,2021-03-22,"Well, it’s this simple.
What you see there are the buy LIMIT and SELL LIMIT orders. And those are those orders at that precise time you took the snapshot. Looking to the chart you can clearly say that the selling “pressure” is much higher than the buying “pressure”, therefore the price is going to drop.

There are two things you have to consider:
1 - this is the snapshot of the exact moment you looked at it. 1 minute later it maybe completely different as people place or remove limit orders all the time.
2 - and MOST IMPORTANT. You can’t see there the MARKET orders, this is, the buys and sells people are willing to make with no limit price. And these orders TAKE PRIORITY over the limit orders. So basically if a bunch of people are market buying massively, those order will “eat” the limit sell order you see there on the right and the price could easily increase instead of decrease even if you see that huge wall of sell orders.

In my opinion of several years trading these charts are useless, as they do not reflect instant market orders being placed and secondly as I explained the limit orders may change quickly so this is just a picture of a moment in time that may change completely 1, 2, 3 or 5 minutes later.",positive,0.64326984,30

It depends on a lot of factors, but if you have more gradual curved buying and selling power the larger volume side will pretty much always push the price.

&#x200B;

Here you can see that for maybe 5-10 dollars worth of price there are few willing to sell that low, represented by the tiny red foot right next to the market price. The price will certainly increase to the first small wall. Based on the volume of the green side it is unlikely it will pass that first wall. Basically this is why we are fucked at the moment, so join the wall or buy the fucking dip.",positive,0.5558471,1

It's best when trading near big walls or significant resistance to have tight stops and know when you are on the wrong side of it. Get out straight away. But those sell walls can vanish instantly if a lot of buy orders are triggered and price can rocket up as traders reposition sell orders higher.

The United States enjoys massive influence over the entire world by controlling the world reserve currency (USD). If the US decides to impose financial sanctions on another country, they are effectively cut out of world trade - or at least have to go through extremely costly efforts to comply with those sanctions. Controlling the world reserve currency is probably the single most powerful tool any country has when it comes to exercising international power. Even if you are very bullish on crypto (which I assume everyone on this sub is), you have to see how this scares the shit out of the US government, and to a lesser extent, US businesses. Without the control of the world reserve currency, it's likely that countries that do not share the US worldview like China, India, and Russia take a big step forward on the world stage. I'm not going to try to say what is good and bad - who knows what the second and third order effects would be of the world reserve currency being destabilized - but I do feel like people in the crypto community don't really think about these things in their fervent support for the technology.",positive,0.78142345,74

There's a reason people who've been here for a while don't like this, there is no development whatsoever around 99% of the tokens out there. ""Developers"" have most likely never even seen a line of code. 

All they are doing with their funds is marketing, Shiba  for example is such a project with  one of the most extensive marketing efforts I have seen in crypto. 

It's a copy of a copy that's now centralized with a crazy supply that at 0.000000001 cents instantly pops it into top 50 on cmc. It has no value whatsoever. 

The only reason there is a market for it is because people are buying into it after seeing an add, or reading a tweet from a bot hoping it'll moon someday.

There will come a moment when there are no longer people joining these communities and the project will crash, untill then creators slowly sell their tokens and become filthy rich off it. 

The cryptomarket as it is today is a joke, there is so much rubbish to go through before you find legit decentralized communities that managed to survive the bear market and are still building.

Btw, you are correct abouy r/cc, mods there allow vote manipulation from projects they like and ban anything else if they have the slightest hint of manipulation.

There used to be a post on r/cardano asking to upvote a post in r/cc. Mods did nothing about that, while in the meantime I got banned for creating a post about Navcoin and sharing it on discord.

13422,2021-10-15,"Saying ""nobody has the answers"" is actually an extremely unhelpful mindset to spread around and isn't even true. People do know the answers, they just aren't on reddit and have no incentive to share verifiable information with YOU. People who are on reddit have some of the answers, just not the entire answer and certainly not without a good amount of spin.

What is true, is that the metric ton of misinformation and bad interpretations that lead to a lot of bad or circular arguments where no one can verify anything is a symptom of adoption and democratization of the industry. More participants always lead to less truthful consensus and a gravitation towards polarized, reductive conclusions that only get some of the information right while the rest becomes propaganda.

What is true, is understanding that reddit and the internet at large isn't a place to receive information about anything. It's a giant billboard and advertising platform.

What is true is that anyone doing anything real with regards to TA is making money and not sharing their information about it. Anyone making a truly informed decision about what coin to invest in is more likely to spread bad info in order to position themselves better. Anyone who isn't interested in the ""my team is best"" tribalism isn't posting about ""all coins are good actually"" because there's no point for them to do so.

Even doing your own research relies heavily on whether or not you even know what to research and where to get good information from.

The internet isn't a greek forum where great minds come to discuss the finer things in life, it's a big game of telephone where some people desperately try to keep the truth alive while others are having fun making sure information becomes as perverted and useless as possible because they think it's funny or nets them profit.",positive,0.62565804,9

Regulation does not need to be [the 'death' of crypto](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/15/ray-dalio-says-if-bitcoin-is-really-successful-regulators-will-kill-it.html) but rather some growing pains on the road to mass adoption.

>     - I hope to see more regulation aimed at protecting consumers from fraud and manipulation, like the [recently proposed U.S. Virtual Currency Market and Regulatory Competitiveness Act and the Virtual Currency Consumer Protection Act](https://soto.house.gov/media/press-releases/soto-introduces-bipartisan-bills-encourage-consumer-protection-and-regulatory).

Below is an argument written by roberthonker which won 3rd place in the Regulation Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

> **Regulation - Cons**
> 
> - Crypto will centralize if it's regulated harshly. If a government can control which coins operate, and how, then the market is no longer decentralized. We would be back to where we started with the government controlling the monetary system.
> 
> - Many valid projects will be excluded if governments have control over the industry. 
> 
> - Along with the increase of institutional investment, we will also see an increase in the inequality between rich and poor crypto investors. Rich investors already have a benefit in the stock market through their exclusive hedge funds, they haven't gotten to the crypto market yet.
> 
> - If crypto is regulated there will be an excessive amount of KYC. KYC is an absolute pain, and a complete breach of personal privacy.
> 
> We can see that an excessive amount of regulation would seriously harm crypto. Regulation would remove a lot of the things that make crypto decentralized, and if it's not decentralized, then there's no point.

13505,2021-02-14," Initially I was also not a friend of banks joining the market, but look what they are building:

1. a platform for institutional clients and their digital assets

2. a intitunal regulated hot/cold storage

3. a bridge between traditional banking services and digital assets

All of these things are definitely needed if we want to bring cryptocurrencies to the next level. How many people do not understand the concept of a wallet, tokens, seeds, encryption and so on? 

For developing any cryptocurrencies to a global currency we need banks or trusted players that  take care of these services... not everybody has time/knowledge to set up their wallet and store a key securely. 

Right now the biggest differences between fiat and crypto is convenience. If I make a wrong transaction my bank will in 95% of the cases take care of that. If I put a wrong address in my transaction, my cryptos are gone.

The 3. point could bring the option to purchase stocks with crypto. If a central bank could offer this service, the use cases for cryptos and prices would skyrocket. Maybe they would take a fee, but it would bring adoption to the next level. And if we have adoption, maybe some smart people find a way to offer these services decentralized.",positive,0.91271365,8

- businesses in several countries may start holding crypto, leading to an increase in price. For instance an ecommerce in Russia or Thailand that accepts Paypal may prefer to hold the bitcoin and cash out to their national currency only a fraction just to pay costs and taxes, and cash the rest years later for a bigger profit.

I personally believe cz is keeping do Kwon safe for now, and is making sure lunc and ustc get back to the prices they were at.    By doing this,it will pay back initial investors and restore faith in crypto. And get the government off their asses.

GMI PAC which PRIMARILY backed Republican-ALIGNED crypto innovation pac. So FTX donated to a pac that supported dems and republicans.

14467,2021-11-25,"The metaverse allows people to play games that they have control and ownership of the items in the metaverse.

If you play your favorite game 12 hours a day and gain abilities and tools to make you a very powerful player, you can actually sell for instance a sword to another player and make real money to pay for your real world expenses.

This is vastly different from the olden days of centralized gaming where only the top top players could make some money at tournaments.  And the centralized game owners f(or instance blizzard) can change the rules on you or to shut down the servers. This can't happen in a decentralized metaverse gaming system.

Play to earn and buy to play is going to be an ecosystem that will be mutually symbiotic for people who play the game as a career and for people who have an interest and the ability to buy the tokens or tools to allow them to become a better, more effective  player.

As an example I had a roommate who played world of Warcraft 20 hours a day and all he did was pay blizzard for the privilege to play and he never made any money from his work and he was frankly addicted.

The next world of Warcraft game, whatever it might be,  will allow the players to have control of their characters, tools, weapons and be able to buy, sell, trade & upgrade all the items in their control (NFTs) in a decentralized way on a marketplace and the centralized companies like blizzard can't pull the rug on the users.

We can all thank the creator of Vitalik for starting this after his experience with world of Warcraft:
(Quote from the web);

Vitalik Buterin created ethereum, the technology behind the cryptocurrency ether, after World of Warcraft developers weakened his prized character.

Below is an argument written by MrMoustacheMan which won 1st place in the Regulation Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

> #Regulation - Pro Arguments (Part 1/2)
> 
> - *Disclaimer: reusing my previous argument [from here](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pfoogx/rcc_cointest_general_concepts_regulation/hevkdyv/)*
> - While I wrote an [entry for the Con Thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/CointestOfficial/comments/r6w0hm/general_concepts_round_regulation_conarguments/hofamky/) outlining some negative aspects of crypto regulation, I'm not fundamentally opposed to crypto regulation. 
> 
>     - In fact, I think *commonsense*, *impartial* government oversight can be beneficial 
> 
>     - I want to live in a society where regulation protects citizens from exploitation, pollution, unsafe products, surveillance etc.
> 
> - I think the answer for crypto falls somewhere between the '[do nothing](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/28/tesla-ceo-elon-musk-says-us-government-should-avoid-regulating-crypto.html)' approach and the '[omg it's super dangerous regulate it into the ground](https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/at-hearing-warren-delivers-remarks-on-digital-currency)' opinion. Regulation does not need to be [the 'death' of crypto](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/15/ray-dalio-says-if-bitcoin-is-really-successful-regulators-will-kill-it.html) but rather some growing pains on the road to mass adoption.
> 
> - **TLDR**:
> 
>     - Like Brian Brooks (former Acting Comptroller of the Currency, Coinbase General Counsel and Binance US CEO), I agree that the most beneficial regulation would focus on enforcing ""[rules for compensating losses and instituting cybersecurity standards](https://decrypt.co/81020/brian-brooks-not-everything-crypto-needs-be-regulated).""
>     - I hope to see more regulation aimed at protecting consumers from fraud and manipulation, like the [recently proposed U.S. Virtual Currency Market and Regulatory Competitiveness Act and the Virtual Currency Consumer Protection Act](https://soto.house.gov/media/press-releases/soto-introduces-bipartisan-bills-encourage-consumer-protection-and-regulatory). Or the [EU's recently proposed legislation](https://www.consilium.europa.eu\/media/53105/st14067-en21.pdf), as discussed by /u\/BelgianPolitics [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r218s7/the_most_important_piece_of_regulation_on/).
>     - For a deeper dive, [Coinbase](https://assets.ctfassets.net/c5bd0wqjc7v0/7FhSemtQvq4P4yS7sJCKMj/a98939d651d7ee24a56a897e2d37ef30/coinbase-digital-asset-policy-proposal.pdf) and [Andreessen Horowitz](https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/How-to-Win-the-Future-1.pdf) put out frameworks for regulation that expand on these points.

> ##Protect the little guy

Consumers lost $80M in crypto investment scams, with a median reported loss of $1,900.
> 
>     - Another study reported at least [355 instances of cryptocurrency scams over a period of 7 months](https://ifrogs.org/PDF/marketMicrostructure_2020/Dhawan_Putnins_2020.pdf).
> 
>     - ""[99% of major fraud volume in the second half of 2020 stemmed from ‘rug pulls’ and other exit scams in a pattern eerily reminiscent of the 2017 ICO craze](https://decrypt.co/55787/defi-rug-pulls-were-cryptos-top-fraud-scheme-in-2020-ciphertrace)”.
> 
> - But investors should be smart, DYOR and not FOMO - isn't it your own fault if you YOLO'd into dickbutt.finance and got rugpulled? Why should the government step in?

>     - Sure. But there's also a lot of unregulated manipulation in the space that gives exposure and legitimacy to scams.

>     - Celebrities and influencers have been [getting paid to promote shitcoins](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/kim-kardashian-crypto-ethereum-max-cryptocurrency-regulator-fca-scam-risks-2021-9) since [the 2017 ICO craze](https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2018/7/22/17510130/cryptocurrencies-celebrities-scam-paris-hilton-steven-seagal-akon-mayweather\)):

But when it comes to manipulation and scams, regulators pass responsibility onto the little guy rather than enforce systemic oversight of market manipulation:
> 
>     - The SEC for example [made a fake ICO landing page](https://www.howeycoins.com/index.html) aimed at educating investors. Thanks guys, all in HoweyCoin.
> 
>     - Meanwhile, ""*there is virtually no action from regulators or law enforcement agencies to counter these cryptocurrency pump-and-dump schemes* ... *the only regulatory recognition of these schemes is a notice from the US Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) [(link)](https://www.cftc.gov/sites/default/files/idc/groups/public/@customerprotection/documents/file/customeradvisory_pumpdump0218.pdf) advising the public to be wary of pump-and-dump manipulation on cryptocurrency exchanges and announcing a reward for whistleblowers who report manipulators.*"" [(source)](https://ifrogs.org/PDF/marketMicrostructure_2020/Dhawan_Putnins_2020.pdf)

Miners are just random people using their computer to serve up the network to users while keeping the hosting side of the network decentralized. The possibility of receiving a bitcoin while mining is just payment for your operational costs (electricity and hardware). Everything online needs a server. So there really is no alternative to hosting a decentralized currency. Nobody is going to mine if there’s no incentive to do so, and if there’s no miners it would be easy for an entity to take control of the network and turn it into another central bank, defeating the purpose of its original intent.

The comment thread to the untrained eye contains what appears to be individual participants who further vindicate the initial comment.

* Mortgage abuses.
* Fraud.
* Toxic securities abuses.

* Economic sanction violation.
* Consumer protection violation
* Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.

It's a great first step for many people to learn and gain exposure to crypto and blockchain.  But, the problem is that most people lack motivation and awareness to continue learning and expanding on that knowledge.  These people remain ignorant Bitcoin fanboys and never get to truly learn about smart contracts or of the infrastructure of defi apps that is being built.  

It doesnt help that there is a hive-mind echo chamber in most BTC circles that will discriminate against anything other than BTC.  It's like these groups keep each other down and preventing any individual growth.

The real power of blockchain is in smart contracts and a new layer of applications that will affect all of global commerce and industry.

With the coming of decentralized, uncensorable databases, and with reliable data oracles, entire industries will become automated by lines of code.  We will eventually see the building of what will be 'an internet of blockchains,' where many blockchains will act as L2's and use the most secure smart-contract enabled blockchain as L1 (Ethereum, obviously, unless something catastrophic).

The best thing you can do with Bitcoin, is wrap it to WBTC to use on a better network in DeFi...  but why not just buy ETH instead, especially now after POS is live and the engine is working and burning.

15740,2022-04-02,"Hey! Look at my left hand while the right one does the magic.

Do you feel me?

When so many influential people tell you to buy Bitcoin, you sure buy it, right? Because they have made billions and told everyone, including you, to join them each time they had an opportunity. 

Right?

""Diamond hands, laser eyes but back to wrapping sandwiches because some people told me to buy BTC at $65k and I put all my savings there.""

I am sorry to let you all know that those billionaires that advertise BTC and tell normies that BTC is the future and will be the One World Currency and that we should all buy it...are just eating crap for breakfast. 

Michael Saylor sold thousands of BTC without telling you but he only tweets when he buys so that BTC will really look good for normies ""If he's a billionaire or wtf and buys it, he must know something. I trust him because he proved he can succeed."" Yeah, he made good money and you poor while cheering the power of influencing i....s on twitter.

At the end of the day, know this: The important peeps that advertise anything are not your friends, you are their market or even their product if you will.

Tell me what banks said about crypto in the past years? It's a scam. Guess who was testing and integrating crypto software for money transfers. Yeah, Banks and FIs. Now they will come and say ""crypto is good"".

It always has to be something else to trick the normie with while they do the magic, remember this.",positive,0.9238068,6

15764,2022-04-02,"Bitcoin is not an investment.  It's a speculative intangible token.

That $10k you put into bitcoin, has not grown in value.  The only way you see a return is the day you sell that crypto and manage to cash that into fiat.  Until then, you gave your $10k to someone who got in earlier and cashed out.  And only when you decide to do the same, will you know whether you're up or down.  

The fact is, there's not enough liquidity in the market to cash even 1% of crypto holders out, so there's a high probability at some point in the future there will be a ""bank run"" and if you can't get out fast enough, you may not be able to get out at all.   I understand this is a premise that you guys refuse to acknowledge could exist, but it nonetheless, is real.

And comparing your fictitious return to bank interest is also improper.  You're guaranteed by the government to have that money protected.  You have no such guarantees from any crypto exchange or market.",positive,0.8088432,5

16069,2021-01-07,"I would agree with you if it weren’t for the completely unprecedented one-two punch of a decade of quantitative easing (driving significant asset inflation that was largely confined, at least for the time being, to capital markets) and the stimulus outlays / economic contraction arising from the COVID lockdowns and their impact on employment / productivity. 

There is now a third punch which is increasingly relevant in the US specifically, where it has not occupied center stage since really the 60s and maybe to some extent the 80s, with domestic violence and civil unrest reaching all time highs. Yes, we have had the same sort of things going on around the world in different places every year throughout the 21st century, but the confluence of these global macroeconomic factors with a rapidly diminishing view of the USD as a stable reserve currency are promoting alternatives. 

If you look at things on a ratio basis, in terms of valuation vs assets denominated or outstanding in those other commodities, neither BTC nor ETH is really even at a fraction of the conventional anti-inflation store of value proportions of Gold. For good reason, as both are difficult to understand and remain susceptible to hacking / hard forks / etc which can totally crater confidence overnight. 

However we have seen a generation of retail investors arise out of nowhere during COVID to pass the time and to try and make money on the side. Wild examples of speculatory retail investment are showcased in 2020’s track record for stocks like Tesla or Hertz or GameStop.

These people don’t overlap 1:1 w crypto investors, but they are open to unconventional yield strategies and they are learning more and more about a space that was formerly the domain of cypherpunks and libertarian IT professionals. 

Now on ETH, you specifically have an exponential factor of usage value coming to fruition with the latest protocols, and if you have any conviction in all of the above, it would make sense that a logical valuation given the environment puts it at a significantly higher value ratio vs BTC and at least against its ATH.

Below is an argument written by Nostalg33k which won 1st place in the Bitcoin Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

> Writing a Pro argument for Bitcoin in 2022 seems complicated because everything has been said... or did it?
> 
> Edit: I have a small bag of Bitcoin currently valued around 600 bucks. I am also invested in crypto around 2000 bucks which are always moving when Bitcoin is moving. Financial disclosure should be mandatory in these arguments =) 
> 
> # Bitcoin is the king of POW: Why it matters and why we need a strong Bitcoin
> 
> So as the title suggests it, the recent news from Ethereum switching from POW to POS makes Bitcoin the sole serious POW cryptocurrency. In this write up, we are going to discuss the three main strength of Bitcoin, security, decentralization, and incentive for green energy production. In this write up we are not going to talk about speculation or the financial side of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a highly liquid asset and has become nearly universally known as an investment. Many arguments have been made in favor of Bitcoin as an investment and if you want to read one, just go to past cointests.
> 
> &#x200B;
> 
> Of course, the main feature of Bitcoin is the Permissionless aspect. This won't be tackled at all as I think it deserves its own topic.
> 
> &#x200B;
> 
> # 1) Bitcoin: High security
> 
> This topic has also been talked to death: Bitcoin is ultra secure thanks to its Blockchain and the way it is verified through proof of work. To explain this let me quote IBM:
> 
> &#x200B;
> 
> >Public blockchain networks typically allow anyone to join and for participants to remain anonymous. A public blockchain uses internet-connected computers to validate transactions and achieve consensus. Bitcoin is probably the most well-known example of a public blockchain, and it achieves consensus through ""bitcoin mining."" Computers on the bitcoin network, or “miners,” try to solve a complex cryptographic problem to create proof of work and thereby validate the transaction. Outside of public keys, there are few identity and access controls in this type of network.  
> >  
> >[IBM on Blockchain security](https://www.ibm.com/topics/blockchain-security)
> 
> &#x200B;
> 
> Mining is measured in Hashrate. Here is the explanation of Hashrate:
> 
> >Hash rate, sometimes referred to as hashrate, is a measure of the computing power on a cryptocurrency network that serves as a key security indicator. It measures the total computational power used by a “proof-of-work” (POW) cryptocurrency network to process transactions in a blockchain.  
> >  
> >[USNEWS explains hashrate](https://money.usnews.com/investing/term/hash-rate#:~:text=Hash%20rate%2C%20sometimes%20referred%20to,process%20transactions%20in%20a%20blockchain)
> 
> &#x200B;
> 
> So if the hashrate measures the security of the network, one may asks themselves: ""Did the security of Bitcoin slowed when the price fell ?""
> 
> [The hashrate is at an ATH and growing making Bitcoin more and more secure as it continues to build over time](https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_network_hash_rate#:~:text=Basic%20Info,101.2%25%20from%20one%20year%20ago)
> 
> &#x200B;
> 
> So Bitcoin has never been as secure as it is today which makes it ultra valuable as a way to settle financial transactions. Yes holding Bitcoin for a long time is risky but using it as a medium to settle international transaction may currently be the securest and one of the best way to do so.
> 
> While Bitcoin is safe... what if a big part fails ?
> 
> &#x200B;
> 
> # 2) Bitcoin mining: Too big to fail.
> 
> &#x200B;
> 
> So this write up could be seen as a POW write up, which it is to an extent. But Bitcoin offers its history and shows that it can survive the disparition of a big part of the network.
> 
> Decentralization allows for parts of the network to disappear and for the rest to take the mantle of securing the network. Yes, mining pools may grow too large for their own sake BUT in the end (nothing even matters) Bitcoin is heavily decentralized. It is so decentralized that, when China (which had a big part of Bitcoin mining) banned mining, Bitcoin just went through like nothing happened. Yes the hashrate fell a bit, the value too, but if we look back, it was nothing extraordinary.
> 
> &#x200B;
> 
> So if Bitcoin is highly secure and if it can survive part of the hashrate going bye bye, what makes it so good? What is the difference with any POW Cryptocurrency right now?
> 
> &#x200B;
> 
> # 3) Bitcoin: propping up the green energy sector.
> 
> &#x200B;
> 
> POW uses energy. One of the biggest concern about POW is the energy. While Ethereum was using GPUs and was asic resistant. Bitcoin mining is built differently. A long time ago, under oath, people discussed the environmental impact of Bitcoin Mining and I made a post explaining what was said:
> 
> &#x200B;
> 
> >The Energy Fud Was Killed
> 
> The most important thing that happened: The narrative that Bitcoin is too energy intensive was totally reversed.
> 
> Experts of the sector explained that, Wind Farms and Solar Farms, have a variable load. This variable load means that sometimes they lose money because they produce too much and there is not enough demand. Bitcoin mining provides a variable base load for these projects. What it means is that, mining can be turned on and off depending on demand. It was revealed that most of these wind and solar farms would simply not exist without Bitcoin Farming as baseline customers.
> 
> There are still miners that are using coal plants and fossil fuel but the leaders of the industry are developing in tandem with the green energy sector.
> 
> >[My post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/s99phv/yesterday_one_of_the_most_bullish_events_ever/)
> 
> &#x200B;
> 
> # Conclusion: Bitcoin is the flagship of POW and it is a feature not a bug.
> 
> Bitcoin, thanks to its value and tokenomics is seen as a good investment, this is also why miners commit huge amount of ressources to take the hashrate to new heights. These miners help the US grid to become more and more resilient. The future of Crypto and of green energy relies a lot on Bitcoin. Bitcoin has proven time and time again that it can shoulder these changes. Bitcoin is a good piece of technology and I hope people continue to invest in it because it is doing a lot of good for our future !

Below is an argument written by Far-Scholar9028 which won 3rd place in the Bitcoin Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

> Understanding the benefits and drawbacks of the bitcoin blockchain is essential if you're considering investing in bitcoin. In the previous thread, we named a few pros of BTC, now let's move on to the cons of BTC.
> 
> **Volatility**
> 
> Bitcoin is a traders dream due to volatility, however that is also one of its biggest issues. Bitcoin will never be used as a currency due to price fluctuations. If a car was first purchased for 2 BTC and returned a week later, for instance, should 2 BTC be returned despite the fact that the valuation has increased, or should the new amount (calculated in accordance with current valuation) be sent? 
> 
> **Security**
> 
> Bitcoin Network Security: There might be undiscovered weaknesses in the Bitcoin system. Due to the fact that this system is still relatively new, if Bitcoins were to become extensively used and a fault was discovered, it might greatly increase the wealth of the exploiter at the risk of destroying the Bitcoin economy.
> 
> Wallet Security: Wallets are primed to be lost, hacked and stolen. Bitcoins are virtually lost if a hard drive crashes, a virus corrupts data, the wallet file is corrupted, and the seed phrase is not backed up. Nothing could be done to get it back. These coins will remain abandoned in the system forever. Investors and users could become bankrupt as a result in a matter of seconds with no chance of recovery. 
> 
> **Proof-of-Work**
> 
> The PoW is a mechanism for assisting a group of strangers who are also self-interested, equal, and there are no subordinates in the network, according to the Satoshi Nakamoto Institute. PoW requires a lot of energy. It's expensive and demands a lot of processing power. It is susceptible to the infamous 51% assault, which means that if hostile miners control 51% of the network, they might seize dominance and render decentralization useless.

Below is an argument written by Tritador which won 3rd place in the Bitcoin Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

> The way you make money in cryptocurrency is you buy what rich people and big companies are going to buy before they buy it. Bitcoin is the first, largest, most successful and established, and most well-known cryptocurrency. So when a big financial company managing a lot of retirement accounts wants to dip its toes into crypto by allocating 5% of its billions of dollars of portfolios into crypto, it's not going to buy micro-caps and hope for moonshots. It's going to buy bitcoin.
> 
> Bitcoin is incredibly important specifically because it's the first, biggest, oldest, and most established.
> 
> Admittedly, the technology behind bitcoin is old. It doesn't do anything ""the best"" when it comes to cryptocurrency. Other coins can be sent faster, more cheaply, mined more efficiently and economically and environmentally consciously, and so on. But that's not the modern purpose of bitcoin. The modern purpose of bitcoin is to be big and established and be worth a lot of money.
> 
> The cryptocurrency market needs bitcoin because it is the heartbeat of the market. The glue that holds it together. If bitcoin ever stops being the biggest and most established crypto, it will have failed at the last remaining thing it is supposed to be good at. All of the rich people and institutional money that entered the space will sell their bitcoin. Countless bots that buy and sell everything based on the price of bitcoin will sell off everything. The market will crash and take years to recover. The media will have a heyday declaring crypto an unstable scam. Trust in cryptocurrency will be all but gone. No rich companies are going to come back into this market sector for a long time. Crypto will transition back to idealistic ""I'm here for the tech"" investors who aren't making much money while dreaming of crypto one day making a come-back.
> 
> If bitcoin ever goes away, this all ends. The market needs bitcoin to continue doing exactly what it's doing for as long as possible.

One potential issue with the larger block size associated with BCH is that security could be compromised relative to the Bitcoin network. Similarly, bitcoin remains the most popular cryptocurrency in the world as well as the largest by market cap, so users of BCH may find that liquidity and real-world usability is lower than for bitcoin.

17084,2020-08-17,"An oracle network needs its own distinct asset in order to represent the security of the network. Now you may ask, “Why not just allow users to pay in another token, like ETH or DAI?” There are a few answers to this, many of which overlap into the other requirements of a viable decentralized oracle system.

First, if nodes were to take payment in a stablecoin, then the security of the network, which is the value of that oracle network’s asset staked in service agreements, could be severely compromised or fail if that stablecoin project were to fail or experience some type of catastrophic issue. The problem here is the disconnect between the stablecoin project and the oracle project. The oracle project could fail as a result of a stablecoin project, but the stablecoin project wouldn’t fail as a result of a failure in the oracle project. It’s important that the only way in which the oracle network can fail is due to an internal problem in the oracle network itself, as opposed to externally-induced failures.

What about paying in the blockchain’s native token, like ETH? This is actually a significantly more complex protocol to implement when you consider a network of blockchain agnostic nodes. A single client (node) would need to stake and accept payment in the native asset of each network it is set up on, rather than requiring a single payment medium for its work across any chain. This entails establishing wallet setups for each network it supports and maintaining complex account/staking balances for fluctuating assets in different crypto-economic systems, all at the same time. The complexity demonstrated gets into the network of nodes discussion, but in short, the more active a node operator has to be, the more likely it is that they will not stick around long term, thus reducing the security of the network. With a single asset associated with compensating node operators across any blockchain, network cost and security can remain synchronized across any supported blockchain.",positive,0.5453463,4

The first method is to mine it when the difficulty is low enough that CPUs can be used, or to buy it from miners when the price is nothing or close to it.  You might think we're well beyond this right now but it could happen again if the price crashes to zero.

The second method is to trade it on exchanges, taking advantage of high liquidity and volatility to acquire more while reducing one's effective cost per coin.  This is what most people have been doing for the last ten years and may continue to do for many years more. But for every dollar gained a dollar was lost, and all of the people who've lost money to trading crypto have no intention of repeating the same mistake.  The lack of demand has reduced both the liquidity and volatility of the market, forcing us to transition to the third method.

The third method is to buy and hold.  Save your fiat over time and when the price of Bitcoin drops unusually low you buy it and hold it in a safe place, like a cold wallet.  This is the long game and it just began in early 22, after the crash in the fall of 21.",positive,0.83902013,3

17235,2022-12-02,"#CBDC Pro-Arguments
Below is an argument written by cryotosensei which won 2nd place in the CBDC Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

> The typical retail investor may assume that Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are a high-brow concept that is still in the conceptualisation stage and will only take effect in the future. However, according to Atlantic Council, ten countries have fully launched CBDCs, the most prominent of which has to be the digital yuan, also known as e-CNY, that was launched in China and continues to make superb inroads into consumers’ payment habits. The IMF also noted in a speech in February 2022 that about 100 countries are currently exploring CBDCs in one way or another. Hence, CBDCs may well become as ubiquitous as fiat currency. Just what are the advantages of CBDCs? 
> 
> 1. CBDCs are backed by the central bank, so they are recognized as legal tender and can be used as a payment app. Besides the peace of mind afforded to citizens, CBDCs come in handy during periods of economic downturns because central banks can deploy them quickly to give out stimulus checks to the lowest-income groups who need government handouts the most. 
> 2. CBDCs are distributed through commercial banks. This alleviates the problem of too much disruption to the financial system. 
> 3. CBDCs help unbanked populations get access to money and be included in their nation’s financial systems. Take for instance Jamaica, in which 17% of the population are unbanked. Since mobile phone use in Jamaica is pervasive, the authorities’ launch of a CBDC called Jam-Dex will help unbanked Jamaicans get paid electronically since they can access it via a banking app on their phones. The same can be said of the Bahamas, which launched the Sand Dollar in October 2020 to reach out to its unbanked population.
> 4. CBDCs provide cost savings. One reason why Jamaica piloted its Jam-Dex program in the first place was the substantial cost (more than $7 million) incurred in replacing dollar notes of all kinds. Removing all transaction costs problems associated with cash will thus save government agencies and business enterprises money.
> 5. CBDCs bolster resilience to the domestic payments market. In China, AliPay and TenPay/WeChat Pay dominate the mobile payments market. Should the private enterprises governing these mobile payments suffer a huge hit to their vitality, the repercussions on the mobile payments system could be far-reaching (and aggravated if there are no safety nets in place). The incorporation of the e-CNY was  aimed to act as a backup to AliPay and TenPay/WeChat Pay.
> 6. CBDCs facilitate cross-border remittances at a low cost. Cambodia launched its CBDC, Bakong, in October 2020. Since many Cambodians work overseas in Malaysia, the National Bank of Cambodia collaborated with Malaysian commercial bank, Malayan Banking so that Cambodian migrant workers in Malaysia could send money to their loved ones without hassle.
> 7. CBDCs act as a safeguard against the illicit use of money. The Bahamas did not have a robust Anti-Money Laundering/Combating Financing of Terrorism framework and was flagged out to undergo extra monitoring under the Financial Action Task Force list in 2018. Following its introduction of the Sand Dollar, the Bahamas was taken off the list in December 2020. 
> 8. CBDCs is a safer option compared to stablecoins, which are largely unregulated and pose risks to the financial system. The recent collapse of the algorithmic stablecoin, UST underscores this point. 
> 9. CBDCs ensure monetary sovereignty. Particularly, the United States would be concerned if global citizens start adopting a stablecoin or a foreign CBDC en masse, thus leading to the possibility that the U.S. dollar might not remain the world’s favored payment mechanism. This explains why President Joe Biden signed an executive order in March 2022 that focused on the exploration of a U.S. CBDC.

Below is an argument written by Nostalg33k which won 2nd place in the CBDC Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

> # CBDCs are the worst possible outcome for our societies. 
> 
> &#x200B;
> 
> CBDCs or Central Bank Digital Currencies are a very bad idea. While government planning can be a good thing, the problem with CBDCs are multiple and none should be underestimated: 
> 
> &#x200B;
> 
> # 1) Tracking money, free will and consumption. 
> 
> &#x200B;
> 
> In a world with CBDCs, the data collection would allow government to use ultra specific ads targeted to the individual in order to push them towards certain behaviors. The tracking of money would allow the government to have an eye in your personal finances. 
> 
> # 2) A good government ? 
> 
> A good government is required for CBDCs to work, the problem is that a good government is one of the hardest thing to achieve and the requirements may vary. An example for our platform is: would you trust the Chinese government to manage a CBDC or the Talibans ? I don't think so.  
> 
> # 3) What about the forgotten people ? 
> 
> With the expansion of NIMBY minded-people, we think less and less of homeless people. The problem with CBDCs is that they are pushing us towards a cashless society. People living through scraps of coins from pan handling would die off. A society which hasn't resolved the Homeless problem should not be introducing CBDCs and other steps towards a cash-less society. 
> 
> # Conclusion: 
> 
> CBDCs may be one of the most powerful financial tool ever created BUT they are also a doubled edged sword. One should be very careful when trying to introduce it and their introduction without consent from the population could lead to uprising and other troubles.

https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/opacity  
  
I've been following the storage sector since reading the ETH whitepaper years ago. One of the applications Vitalik uses as an example for smart contracts is the concept of making a decentralized storage network. Of course, this is more complicated than a decentralized exchange but still possible.  
  
Everyone knows filecoin, a $6 billion market cap project. There are several others and the total market cap is about $20 billion. I expect this total market cap number to grow as the tech continues to develop and most importantly, projects are made that people can actually use. Enter opacity:  
  
• ⁠Usable product, try out a free account at opacity.io 

• ⁠Mobile application is about to be launched on apple and andriod app store. The community is currently beta testing and the release is close 

• ⁠SIA integration: Opacity developers are currently integrating the back-end with SIA, another decentralized storage project (not ETH based). Essentially the idea here is that in addition to storage nodes (people providing extra space on their hard drive, for example) other projects can be used to provide storage as well. In other words, opacity can be a user friendly way to access other decentralized storage projects 

• ⁠Currently there are 5,000 active accounts using opacity for file storage 

• ⁠Market cap is very low compared filecoin ($6 billion), SIA ($1 billion), storj ($300 million)",positive,0.9177177,28

It will be in the multi trillion market cap within 3-10 years looking at $1000+.

The point potential failure is far in the rear view mirror. The nature of all dapps that do things that are meaningful and provide value in the real world economy all require oracles to feed their native smart contracts. Each dapp using the chainlink network feeds the value of the link token as each individual one grows and utilizes more and more data. The link token is uniquely setup to grow from the success of all other projects. There is no other coin in comparison other than ethereum, and other networks.

Cannabis is restricted in some countries so stocks are not an option either, but this opens the door for the rest of the world to invest in an exponentially growing cannabis industry!

EverGrow Coin 

Deflationary asset that distributes reflections in BUSD. The reflections are 8% and more than half the circulating supply has been burned already.
They have an anti-whale feature that dosent let whales sell more than 0.125% of the total supply in one transaction.

They also have a Buy-Back and Burn function. When Buy-Back and Burn is enabled, the contract purchases EGC from exchanges, which creates a green handle, then permanently removes those tokens from circulating supply (burn) which makes the $EGC token scarcer over time. More than 1.7% of tokens have already.

**Utilities and dapps**


Some utilities include Nft Marketplace, Nft Lending, Content Creator subscription platform(think Patreon, YouTube, and onlyfans combined. The platform will increase volume and hence reflections). Utilities all coming within next few months.

Supported Exchanges like Bitmart, Lbank, Bibox and many others to coming in the next few weeks.

As other posters said: learn to trade & create a strategy (it's the only way traders survive legacy markets and 24/7 crypto when they don't have a whole workday to trade):  
1. Take trading presumptions 

2. Backtest them (maybe find something out-of-the-box so you don't add too much on your plate while learning trading)

3. See what has potential

4. Work on that

Once you have a strategy you can automate it easily on CLEOone (solid backtester too), Haasonline, or something else depending on what you need.  If you don't want to use builders add coding to the things you need to learn.

It will take more time but you will be lerning a craft instead of stumbling in the dark.",positive,0.92051196,3

Also you need to be crystal clear about tax es due, after the crash in 2018 there were a lot of people that had massive tax bills but no longer any crypto assets.  The reality is that a trading bot is much better suited for arbitrage or market efficiency algorithms, if you believe in crypto you are better off hodling.

17598,2024-03-06,"Here's what I have found while developing a P2P exchange. It is not difficult to obtain gas prices from the Ethereum server. It does take a bit of finagling in order to get it right. As well, when the gas prices are too high, clients still want to receive their withdrawals and they mostly don't care about the gas fee unless it is extremely high.

Basically, it takes a lot of actual development to build a system that can save money on the gas fees, but it is not impossible. We're still working on it.

I would not recommend one site over another as it seems to me they are all pretty much taking the easy way out and charging a flat fee for gas. What I would say is; try to avoid small withdrawals. Figure out what you're willing to pay for gas and then never withdraw less than that amount. Or try to.

They are normally charging $8 for a USDT withdrawal, if you withdraw 80 USDT, you will pay 10% gas fees. If you withdraw 800 USDT, then your gas fee is only 1%. Right now, this is the only solution I can think of to reduce gas fees on most exchanges. 

I haven't found any trading sites that are doing any better, they all usually do the same thing and charge flat fees. I do know they are making a killing on gas fees when they are cheap on the chain. 

As I write this, gas fees are very expensive on chain. Today, between €6 and €10 euros. That's today. In February they were €1 or less. So keep that in mind as well.",positive,0.8464255,3

Sure you can’t actively trade crypto for fiat without internet but you can send money anywhere that does instantly without fees and then exchange it for local currency at its current value with taking massive losses from inflation.  For example. I hide 10k in my walls in 1990 and pulled it out today. It would be worth 10k. If I put in a crypto the just matches inflation.  It’s worth 20310. Cash is just an agreed on value, and that agreement changes over time because cash is a just a piece of paper backed by faith in its value. If you can print an infinite supply of cash, the actual value of that cash is 0.  With some crypto there is a limit on the supply. Btc for instance has only 21million total. You can’t make more.

The higher the debt/GDP ratio the harder it is to pay off the debt without extra money printing. So the poorer country expect more future inflation as they are expecting more money printing so that nation sells more of it's currency for the richer countries currencies.

There is quite a bit to it, but really is is about balance. When a price steadily changes, we feel good about it. But when price drops suddenly or rises quickly, that does not look like normal price action and we think something may be off with it.

If you have a good day and all the things in the world go right for you, at some point you may begin to wonder when it will all end. When driving and you get all green lights, you may wonder when the red lights will come. And they do come. The red lights come, the good things come to and end. And then the cycle starts over again.

Think about one more thing, human growth. If a baby grow into a teenager overnight, your suspicions will be deeply aroused. If a friend suddenly becomes a muscular bodybuilder in a week, you may question if they used steroids or not. With these, when they grow too quickly, it doesn’t seem natural.

So going sideways for Bitcoin, when it is not rising too quickly or dropping too fast, makes it seem like it is cooling off after an intense run. And also after rising quickly, the price may come down a bit because the excitement has cooled down.",positive,0.7493061,2

18004,2021-02-11,"For some fucking reason, coinbase has an extra requirement when sending XLM to a coinbase wallet. It’s an additional code supplied by them, that you put into the “memo” field when sending. It’s only for coinbase, and only for XLM on coinbase. 

Like a fucking moron, I guess I missed the instruction, and thought it was just like a memo on a check you write, so I put some stupid shit like “hello world”

Transfer never went through because of that shit. 

After some googling, apparently the transfer IS completed, but because there’s no memo coinbase essential just holds/steals/limbos your XLM. 

Apparently some people have been able to contact them with all the translation information and got their coin properly put into their wallet.

I sell the eth on the market right now, and next week the crash happens and I buy back 100eth for a fraction of the cost, return the eth to the exchange, and just made a ton of money.

*Smaller tokens like Cardano and Solana would be considered ancillary assets and presumed to be a commodity unless the uses of those tokens met exclusions that would kick them over to the SEC’s purview as securities.*

*The legislation offers exclusions for when tokens could constitute securities, including an interest or dividend payment or profit or revenue share with a company that comes from “entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others.”*

18124,2021-09-29,"This article seems like a mess.

1) Hard Money > Weak Money
   Well its complicated as its a far different system than we are used to. Yes, our money becomes stronger over time as there is a limited supply, but that applies to everyone. Moreover, you’ll see wage decreases over time as the money has to keep getting split smaller and smaller. To me, I’d prefer to increase scale rather than arbitrarily decrease it every time.

2) Decentralization > Centralization
    Yeah not really. Benefits of centralization include standardization and efficiency. With how bitcoin works, the efficiency differences are a big pain point. In view of control, this is just pushing the notion that all big groups are inherently evil. While I hate banks, I still will trust them more than some average smuck with a computer, or even worse, some malicious computer geek. Super difficult to regulate something no one has control over…

3 and 4) Privacy > Surveillance and Truth > Deception
This actually compete with each other. It claims a benefit is the transparency of transactions whilst also the privacy? You can’t have your cake and eat it too. Especially as transactions increase, people can use known information to tie you to your signature and then all your transactions are public

5) Freedom > Oppression
    Again, instead of putting trust into a single organization, you put it into a group of random people with no regulation. Then claim that because you can host a node, that you get freedom? No. The technical level and resources to host a node, and actually know what you’re doing bars that stupid argument. Its a “well technically you can but you really shouldn’t”. Part of the reasons banks are useful are because they remove the technical issues from our usage.

6) Future > Past
    Yes, future > past, but bitcoin is not it. First off, being one of the early coins, it doesn’t offer as much of others, nor has it really tried to improve. I.e. look at Eth2.0, proof of work alone alleviates some of the pain points such as efficiency. Moreover, as the chain is public, there isn’t much of built-in security in case future research break the hashing algorithm. What I’m thinking of is quantum in specific. Its difficult to claim bitcoin is the future with so many lingering problems that it can’t really address",positive,0.85994774,1

> 
> But why are they good?
> 
> - DEX allows us to have use and swap coins freely without any intermediary
> 
> - DEX have no-one to take the fees so they are far cheaper than CEX
> 
> - If you want to use a CEX you need KYC in most cases. With DEX you dont.
> 
> - Not your keys not your coins? DEX allows you to keep your coins exactly where you want them.
> 
> - Its a goldmine for more under the radar cryptocurrencies who are still in early developement 
> 
> - DEX offer high returns on staking and providing liquidity

Below is an argument written by Shippior which won 3rd place in the DEX Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

> Not friendly for beginners. The use of a Decentralized exchange (DEX) requires not only intensive knowledge of how blockchains work (in the end they do not have customer support to help you with a transaction that is stuck) to make sure that the DEX they use is indeed a real DEX and not a scam (legitimicy) but it is also required to have intensive market price knowledge to make sure that the trade is fair.
> 
> As transactions are not performed by a central authority but are operated by the blockchain the transactions are naturally less fast in a DEX than in a Centralized exchange (CEX).
> 
> Liquidity pools and automate market makers are two of the methods most often used by DEXs. Liquidity pools are easy to use but have to major drawbacks.
> 
> Although liquidity pool DEX are the most widely used, they may have some drawbacks. The most common problems of liquidity pool DEXes are price slippage and front running.
> 
> Price slippage occurs because of the AMM (Automated Market Makers) nature itself — the larger the deal, the stronger impact it has on the price. For example, if the constant product AMM is in use, every deal must keep the product xy = k constant, where x and y are quantities of two cryptocurrencies (or tokens) in the pool. So the larger is the input amount Δx, the lower is the final ratio y / x that gives an exchange price. The problem is mostly significant for large deals or small liquidity pools.
> 
> Front running is a special type of attack in public blockchains when some participant (usually a miner) seeing an upcoming trading transaction puts his own transaction ahead (playing with a transaction fee for example), making the initial transaction less profitable or even reverted.
> 
> With the large number of DEXs popping up the liquidity of a DEX also becomes an issue as the available liquidity will be spread out through more DEXs (scalability). This can result in low liquidity in a DEX which will result in worse trades for the user. This is not an issue for a CEX as they have the availability of all the funds that are located on the CEX whereas a DEX has no own funds.
> 
> Also moving forward as a DEX is rather difficult (upgradeability). DEXs that do not have a central entity are forced to either implement governance to move forward, making the useage of a DEX even more complex, or be forced to not enhance and thereby losing their market share as CEXs and centralized DEXs improve. Or a DEX has a central identity to upgrade the platform and therefore the users lose some privacy.

With that said, I feel it wont be long before its profitable enough to rely solely on renewables; solar is currently the cheapest form of electricity, and whilst the climate for good solar generation isnt ideal for keeping farms cool, i think the demand for electricity with many systems shifting towards electrification will push demand high enough to deploy farms in ideal locations and then expand the distribution for the power. Both for the deployment and management of larger solar supplies, and innovation in the solar generation area. It might also drive innovation for existing methods, like geothermal and offshore, with the former typically being in ideal locations for naturally cooling the mining farms too.

I wouldn't call myself a full blown Socialist, but I do believe that if we gave corporations incentive to keep jobs in this country, taxed the rich more proportionately and invested into sources of energy that were not finite, the economy could be booming once again in 10-20 years.

I'm not socialist in any way, but I share most of the same sentiment. My big concern with socialism is that giving governments that level of control almost never works. It works in fascist dictatorships like Nazi Germany and ""communist"" China. But you know how the former turned out and the latter well, you'll start to see that in the next few years. The whole imperialistic aspect of fascism in now economic imperialism. The Chinese have adapted it because for awhile, and to a certain extent still today, they were/are dependent on the US. They are like the Nazis but instead of trying to take over the world by force in a swift campaign, they are playing the long game. 

I would be fine with marxism if it didn't turn into a fascist dictatorship everywhere it has been tried. I just think it's best to let human nature run it's course. Let everyone have their own chance to succeed or fail in life. There are always going to be winners and losers. Even if the government determines everyone is a winner and redistributes all the wealth. The winners are still going to find a way to succeed and the losers will ultimately fail. Since we are an advanced society with surpluses of food, and medical care, the losers can still live a long life as losers. In caveman times, nature would decide who the losers were, and said losers would die without reproducing. Nowadays, nature still decides who the winners are, but it's not survival, it's wealth that is the prize.

Im also in the US, and agree that the system has many flaws that may contribute to our downfall.  Capitalism was never designed to last.  Eventually, the unequal distribution of wealth will tip towards covil unrest, especially with the wealth gap growing.  Power should exist so those who have it can take care of their citizens, not the other way around.  I'm all for entrepreneurship, but I also believe in equal opportunity.

19924,2021-01-27,"First. Alright, let's get down to it. Fb did nothing wrong back then. Their issue was not serving better ads. Their issue was lack of moderation. Moderation is expensive. Moderation is also called ""having an editor"". Meaning they would become a publication. Meaning they would be subject to laws and regulations which are more stringent. I'd say they are making more mistakes recently by over-stepping the amount of moderation. Balance is hard. But in the end, people allow themselves to be fooled if they're open to it. 

Second. Also, people are allowed to regret past actions. And change their minds after their initial project to serve good ads becomes a frankenstein monster, in their opinion. 

Third. Are you knocking philanthropy?

Fourth. Doesn't mean he'll be a good governor, but a politician is comprised of a few skillsets. Some of them are charisma (charming people into voting for them), negotiation skills (striking hard bargains and deals, collaboration), knowledge of systems and laws (policies), capital allocation (budgets), among others. As someone who became a self-made billionaire, he shows skills in negotiation and capital allocation. Knowledge of systems and laws can be acquired through sheer intelligence, will, and hard work. Doesn't seem like it would be an issue for him. And charisma is up to you to judge. Sometimes the best guy isn't the expert in the status quo, but someone who is hungry for action and can learn the ropes fast.

Fifth. Trump was EXACTLY not a good example for what the people actually wished for. They wanted a billionaire who was not accountable to and influenceable anyone like special interest groups. Billionaire? Maybe. Self made? Highly dubious, the guy's track record in growth is 5% per year - just above half of the historical S&P returns. Could have done better just by parking his assets in an ETF. Does not show good capital allocation skills. Accountable and influenceable by dangerous actors? You bet.

- can not trade against customers. 

- No insider trading, where employees buy tokens before a listing announcement.

- No using customer funds to gamble with.

Example for crypto foundations:

- set limits on the amount of tokens a foundation can have

- have legit, regulated IPOs

Price volatility: The announcement of a large sale of bitcoin could cause short-term price volatility in the crypto market. If investors perceive the sale as a negative development, it could lead to a temporary sell-off, whereas a positive perception could lead to a price increase.  
  
Increased institutional interest: The fact that the US government is selling a significant amount of bitcoin could potentially increase institutional interest in the crypto market. Institutional investors may see this as a sign that the government is beginning to take cryptocurrency more seriously and could lead to increased adoption of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.  
  
Regulatory scrutiny: The sale of bitcoin by the US government could potentially lead to increased regulatory scrutiny of the cryptocurrency industry. Regulators may be more inclined to closely monitor and regulate the market in order to prevent illegal activities such as money laundering and fraud.  
  
Market consolidation: The sale of such a large amount of bitcoin could potentially lead to market consolidation, with larger players in the market taking advantage of the sale to acquire more cryptocurrency and potentially gain greater market influence.

> Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer digital currency that can be transferred via the bitcoin network. Bitcoin transactions are cryptographically verified by network nodes and recorded in a public distributed ledger known as a blockchain. The cryptocurrency was created in 2008 by an unknown individual or group of individuals using the alias Satoshi Nakamoto. ([1](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf))
> 
> # PROs
> 
> **It's Decentralized**
> 
> * Decentralization is the process through which an organization's operations are disseminated or delegated away from a central, authoritative location or group, specifically those related to decision-making and planning ([2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#Decentralization)). One of the core assets of Bitcoin is that it is decentralized meaning:
> 
> 1. No need for a central authority
> 2. No need for centralized servers (peer to peer network)
> 3. Ledger is distributed and public
> 4. Anyone can be a bitcoin miner
> 5. Anyone can create a bitcoin address
> 6. Anyone can do a transaction without needing approval from a centralized source
> 
> **Provides Privacy**
> 
> * Bitcoin is a pseudonymous currency, which means that funds are not connected to real-world entities but rather to bitcoin addresses. If you were to own a bitcoin address, there would be no known connection between your identity and that of the address but all transactions will be public. Although it is possible (but hardly) that bad actors may identify your address via correlating the transactions you made, you can increase privacy by creating another address.
> 
> **Security**
> 
> * Bitcoin operates through what is called a Proof of Work algorithm which is a type of cryptographic proof in which one party (the prover) demonstrates to others (the verifiers) that a specific amount of computational effort has been expended. In Bitcoin, miners compete to append blocks and mint new currency, each miner experiencing a success probability proportional to the computational effort expended. Miners in Bitcoin are tasked to validate a transaction by solving a complex problem. The total combined total computational power of these miners combines is what's called a Hashrate. The hashrate is an important metric for assessing the security of the network. The more machines dedicated to discovering the next block by honest miners, the higher the hashrate rises and the more difficult it becomes for malicious agents to disrupt the network. ([3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_work), [4](https://etherplan.com/2020/03/21/why-proof-of-work-based-nakamoto-consensus-is-secure-and-complete/10509/), [5](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/02/05/what-does-hashrate-mean-and-why-does-it-matter/))
> 
> **Scarcity**
> 
> * There will only be 21 million Bitcoins in existence, once all of Bitcoin has been mined there will no more issuance of new Bitcoins and this give it this certain trait of scarcity like precious metals without the difficulty of portability and also the same traits of durability. ([5](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/100314/why-do-bitcoins-have-value.asp), [6](https://www.investopedia.com/tech/what-happens-bitcoin-after-21-million-mined/))
> 
> **The Coin that Started it All**
> 
> * By this time everybody knows why and how Bitcoin, how it's mysterious maker just vanished from the scene and how it's purpose still echoes as a reminder that power of self-custody is never too late to remove ourselves from being too dependent of centralized bodies that often times go beyond what we allow them to do. To this day, Bitcoin still stands as number one coin (by marketcap) and will probably stay that way for a very long time.

> Bitcoin is a decentralized cryptocurrency [conceived in 2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin) by a pseudonymous individual named [Satoshi Nakamoto](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/satoshi-nakamoto.asp). It was released as open-source software in 2009 and has since gained widespread use as a means of exchange, popularized by its ability to allow users to send and receive payments on a peer-to-peer network.
> 
> Transactions made using Bitcoin are in blocks through cryptographic calculations carried out by miners and are recorded on a public ledger called a blockchain. Miners, also known as network validators, use a [Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism based on the SHA-256 algorithm](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/cyber-security-tutorial/sha-256-algorithm) to determine the next global state of the blockchain. Therefore, it is irreversible.
> 
> However, despite its popularity and growing acceptance as a legitimate form of payment, there are several criticisms of Bitcoin that have been raised over the years.
> 
> # Unclear Source of Value
> 
> * Stocks derive their value from the underlying worth of a company and its assets. Gold derives its value from its physical utility as a commodity. Even fiat currencies derive their value from the strength of the country's economy and their widespread utility within their respective countries.
> * Yes, Bitcoin has scarcity and utility, but does this justify its hefty market capitalization? [Brookings](https://www.brookings.edu\/opinions/the-brutal-truth-about-bitcoin/) states that Bitcoin investors seem, in fact, to be ""relying on the greater fool theory—all you need to profit from an investment is to find someone willing to buy the asset at an even higher price.""
> * Unlike fiat currencies, which are issued and backed by central banks, Bitcoin is not backed by any physical commodities or corporate assets. This lack of backing means that the value of Bitcoin is entirely dependent on the mechanism of supply and demand, which has been proven time and time again to be highly volatile.
>    * Some argue that this lack of intrinsic value makes Bitcoin a risky investment, as there is nothing to fall back on if market demand was to suddenly disappear.
> * Essentially, the price of Bitcoin is the price you pay to use its technology - making it seem similar to fiat currencies until you realize that most people [speculate](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/jun/19/life-savings-in-crypto-generation-of-amateurs-hooked-on-high-risk-trading) or invest in Bitcoin rather than using it for its intended purpose. (source: [https://time.com/nextadvisor/investing/cryptocurrency/should-you-use-crypto-like-cash/](https://time.com/nextadvisor/investing/cryptocurrency/should-you-use-crypto-like-cash/))
>    * Without its utility being utilized, then, Bitcoin's value is significantly diminished.
> 
> # Deepseated Stigma
> 
> Despite its potential to revolutionize the financial industry, Bitcoin has faced significant resistance from mainstream institutions and individuals due to a variety of factors.
> 
> * One of the main reasons for the stigma surrounding Bitcoin is its association with illegal activities. In its early days, it was often used on the dark web for the [purchase of illegal goods and services](https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article-abstract/32/5/1798/5427781?redirectedFrom=fulltext), leading to its portrayal as a tool for criminal activity. This association has persisted, with some people still viewing bitcoin as a way to facilitate illegal transactions. This is not an unfounded assumption; cryptocurrency-based crime hit a record $14 billion in 2021 [according to the WSJ.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/cryptocurrency-based-crime-hit-a-record-14-billion-in-2021-11641500073)
> * Unlike traditional currencies, concerns have been raised about its volatility, with the value of Bitcoin frequently fluctuating. While this volatility can be seen as a potential advantage for traders looking to make quick profits, it also makes Bitcoin a less appealing option for investors looking to use it as a stable store of value.
>    * Yes, Bitcoin is [less volatile than the DJI and Nasdaq](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/21/bitcoins-volatility-falls-below-nasdaq-and-sp-500s-for-first-time-since-2020.html), but this is not a fair comparison because the latter are stock indices. Instead, Bitcoin should be compared to the USD as they are more similar in functionality - and as expected, Bitcoin is much more volatile.
> * There is also a perception that Bitcoin is complex and difficult to understand, which can be off-putting for some people. The underlying technology behind Bitcoin, blockchain, and a ""decentralized network of network validators secured by a SHA-256 hashing algorithm"" is a novel concept that can be extremely difficult to grasp for those unfamiliar with it. Yes, [98% of Americans](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/crypto-comprehension-study-98-people-190349019.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAACCMe7hgrXllV_mlEw5tn7u-RoTKVu8UOYrfAhQHYKzUAGM48E4hQZFLRcL4GVt0esSNwGtDtWuNN8LD3ivbs2pcRmmXKpAAhCIw3ZGQQBTMTh4oR0X1OQSWD_jHYbNrgH2lOl0Wj-j6f59cNve0I7q_VF1bIqIqpbD9di-SF8yB) do not understand basic cryptocurrency concepts.
>    * This lack of understanding can lead to skepticism and distrust in the underlying technology, further contributing to the stigma surrounding Bitcoin.
> * Another factor is its lack of regulation - because Bitcoin is decentralized and operates outside of the traditional financial system, it is not subject to the same level of regulation as fiat currencies.
>    * This lack of regulation has led to [concerns about its security](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/oct/01/imf-warns-of-global-risks-from-unregulated-cryptocurrency-boom) and potential for fraud, further contributing to its negative reputation.

Below is an argument written by Maleficent_Plankton which won 2nd place in the Bitcoin Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

> ##**Main PROs**
> 
> Bitcoin is currently the most popular cryptocurrency and marketcap leader. Among all the cryptocurrencies, it's the one your grandma would most likely have heard of. This is mainly due to its first-mover advantage coupled with the network effect. And since cryptocurrency value is largely based on a Keynesian Beauty Contest, it's likely to remain the most popular for years to come.
> 
> **First-Mover Advantage**: This gave Bitcoin a huge head start over its competitors despite that it's technologically behind. If Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin were all released simultaneously, Bitcoin would lose to its competitors because its competitors have much more efficient designs with higher throughput. There are many newer networks that have 10-100x Bitcoin's throughput and have 100x cheaper fees. But the reality is that Bitcoin's first-mover advantage gave it such a huge head start that the others can't catch up.
> 
> **The Network Effect**: This means that people will flock to whichever product has the largest user base. Whenever people first invest in cryptocurrency, they notice Bitcoin first because it's the largest and most popular. For half a decade, its name was almost synonymous with cryptocurrency. The network effect creates a positive feedback loop and makes Bitcoin's lead grow even more. Its block subsidy is also the highest, which attracts miners, thus increasing its security.
> 
> **Anti-censorship**: Bitcoin provides partial financial censorship-resistance against sanctions and totalitarian government restrictions. It's much harder to prevent Bitcoin transactions than it is to prevent financial transactions at a centralized bank. For example, many Russians, Iranian, and North Koreans are getting around sanctions by using Bitcoin and mixers. Legal sex workers and marijuana industries are sometimes blocked from using traditional financial services due to social stigma. Bitcoin provides those workers a way to transfer funds that censorship.
> 
> **Pseudonymous**: Bitcoin's UTXO transactions can provide moderately-high levels of obscurity. A single wallet can produce a near-unlimited amount of addresses, and there's no way to link them unless they interact with each other. It's much harder to trace UTXO-based wallets than Account-based wallets because the former creates new UTXO addresses with each transaction while Account-based blockchain wallets typically reuse the same account.
> 
> **Cannot be counterfeited**: Cash can be counterfeited, but you can't fake transactions or UTXOs.
> 
> **Considered a commodity**: Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency that both the SEC and CFTC have openly stated is likely a commodity, so it has a low chance of being subjected to future securities regulations.
> 
> ##**The Bitcoin Narratives and the Knowledge Gap**

> There are so many Bitcoin Maxis who will ignore logic and keep spreading Pro-Bitcoin Narratives of questionable accuracy. Because Bitcoin is a gateway cryptocurrency, crypto newbies will encounter it first and gobble up these narratives because they don't have the experience to know their flaws. Those who aren't technical will believe them without digging deeper. (Sadly, I may have spread a couple of these myself not that long ago.) Thus, Bitcoin tends to cult-ivate a community of block-headed maximalists who are willing to shill and meme Bitcoin all day long.
> 
> **Here's a list of popular but questionable Bitcoin Narratives.** Regardless of whether these are accurate, they will keep spreading and contributing to Bitcoin's popularity and network effect.
> 
> * **Maximum Supply cap guarantees scarcity and that price will keep increasing**: Bitcoin has a supply cap of 2.1 Million Bitcoins, so it's deflationary and will keep going up in price.
>   * **Reality**: Bitcoin is actually inflationary, albeit disinflationary, until 2140. Scarcity is questionable because it can always fork, and there are competing blockchains. There is no guarantee that price will keep going up. The maximum supply cap is also a double-edged sword since mining rewards aren't guaranteed, and Bitcoin's security will likely decline greatly decades from now.
> * **Bitcoin is an Inflation Hedge**
>   * **Reality**: When inflation rose in 2022, Bitcoin plunged in price, proving that it's not a good inflation hedge. Instead, it tends to go up and down with the stock market, but with higher volatility.
> * **Bitcoin is a great Store of Value (i.e. Digital gold)**
>   * **Reality**: Bitcoin's price is too volatile to make it a good Store of Value.
> * **All altcoins are shitcoins**: Altcoins will never beat Bitcoin and always fail. Bitcoin has survived multiple hard forks, bug fixes, country-wide bans, and 80-90% value crashes ... unlike most altcoins.
>   * **Reality**: Altcoins fall harder during bear markets, but they also rise more during bull markets. The better ones also have better protocol designs than Bitcoin. Eventually, one of them could even dethrone Bitcoin.
> * **UTXO batch transactions**: Bitcoin can natively batch UTXO transactions to increase to effective throughput beyond TPS.
>   * **Reality**: While it's true that batch transactions increase effective transfers, they only do so by a maximum of 70%, increasing effective throughput from 3 transfers/s to 5 transfers/s. There is a 40% savings in storage space, and 75% savings in fees [[Source](https://blog.coinbase.com/reflections-on-bitcoin-transaction-batching-b13dad12a12)]. Also note that account-based smart contracts can save similar amounts of storage and fees, so this isn't unique to Bitcoin.
> * **The Lightning Network can scale Bitcoin to the global population**: The Lightning Network can greatly scale Bitcoin and enable fast peer-to-peer transactions.
>   * **But**: It can't scale well past 1% of the global population since users are expected to open and close channel regularly. And if 10% of the global population uses the Lightning Network, they can only open and close channels once every 8 years on average due to congestion on Layer 1. The only way to get around this is if everyone only interacts on centralized exchanges without touching the network itself.
> * **Decentralization**: Bitcoin is the most decentralized cryptocurrency because it has the highest Nakamoto Coefficient when measured by individual miners.
>   * **Reality**: The top 3 mining pools own 60% of the network hash rate, and the true coefficient is just 3.
> * **Fair launch**: Bitcoin had a fair launch. First the first couple of years, anyone had to work for their Bitcoins. There was no ICO.
>   * **But**: There were only ~100 miners the first several years, and that they mined out the vast majority of all Bitcoins and got a huge advantage over everyone else.
> 
> If these are flawed arguments, why am I even listing them as Pros? **To show that even if these narratives are questionable, there are so many of them, and they will keep spreading.** For each person who realizes their flaws, two more newbies who don't bother with research will gobble them up.

Below is an argument written by Far-Scholar9028 which won 3rd place in the Bitcoin Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

> Understanding the benefits and drawbacks of the bitcoin blockchain is essential if you're considering investing in bitcoin. In the previous thread, we named a few pros of BTC, now let's move on to the cons of BTC.
> 
> **Volatility**
> 
> Bitcoin is a traders dream due to volatility, however that is also one of its biggest issues. Bitcoin will never be used as a currency due to price fluctuations. If a car was first purchased for 2 BTC and returned a week later, for instance, should 2 BTC be returned despite the fact that the valuation has increased, or should the new amount (calculated in accordance with current valuation) be sent? 
> 
> **Security**
> 
> Bitcoin Network Security: There might be undiscovered weaknesses in the Bitcoin system. Due to the fact that this system is still relatively new, if Bitcoins were to become extensively used and a fault was discovered, it might greatly increase the wealth of the exploiter at the risk of destroying the Bitcoin economy.
> 
> Wallet Security: Wallets are primed to be lost, hacked and stolen. Bitcoins are virtually lost if a hard drive crashes, a virus corrupts data, the wallet file is corrupted, and the seed phrase is not backed up. Nothing could be done to get it back. These coins will remain abandoned in the system forever. Investors and users could become bankrupt as a result in a matter of seconds with no chance of recovery. 
> 
> **Proof-of-Work**
> 
> The PoW is a mechanism for assisting a group of strangers who are also self-interested, equal, and there are no subordinates in the network, according to the Satoshi Nakamoto Institute. PoW requires a lot of energy. It's expensive and demands a lot of processing power. It is susceptible to the infamous 51% assault, which means that if hostile miners control 51% of the network, they might seize dominance and render decentralization useless.

I also think anyone who thinks Ethereum are on the way out and their downfall is inevitable is also majorly jumping the gun. They have their issues but they also have a huge ecosystem.

There is a deep and unwavering conviction in that community and they have all been rewarded generously for that conviction so I’m not sure what stops this from rising more in the near term. Once smart contracts are in place the hype train will shift to DApps in development, hydra scaling to 2 million TPS, the entire continent of Africa being modernized, etc. If the price can appreciate this much when no smart contracts are in place who knows how high it can go when that milestone is cleared?

Do I think it’s majorly inflated? Most definitely. But a critical mass thinks otherwise and that matters",positive,0.7556983,30
20763,2021-08-28,"I once sold early. Just as a quick trade. Nothing crazy. The idea was simply to sell high, wait for the price to come down, then buy back in.

20772,2021-08-28,"If you're here only for quick gains, then look somewhere else because I personally believe that ADA is great for long term investment. Majority of ADA investors are involved in staking, therefore they're earning rewards every 5 days regardless of ADA price goes up or down. Many people ignore the power of passive income.

Lets say you managed to accumulate 500k ADA and you're staking it, you would be earning  \~5-6% APY in rewards, that would be around 25k ADA per year (That's 70k USD per year, that's way above national minimum wage in many countries).  That answers your claim ""NO REAL USAGE"".

Just in case you forgot the real definition of ""INVESTMENT"":""*An investment is an asset or item acquired with the goal of generating income or appreciation. Appreciation refers to an increase in the value of an asset over time.* ***When an individual purchases a good as an investment, the intent is not to consume the good but*** ***rather to use it in the future to create wealth***\*."" Ref - Investopedia\*

I don't really see the point on selling now just to buy later at a probably higher price point when I can just stake the ADA, grow the bag and ride any correction in the short term.",positive,0.8714944,2
20775,2021-08-28,"Well technically the current usage (if you don't want to write on [cardanowall](https://cardanowall.com/en/), or buy an [NFT](https://web.wolframnftauctions.com/nft/aab84c8a-6af9-44a5-9ae5-7bb188377f04)), is 5% stake rewards. If I bought bought 1,000 ADA when it was a dollar, I'd make 50 ADA a year (on average as stake rewards fluctuate given k value).

The stake rewards were brought out in 2020 as a way to get the network going and aren't going away anytime soon as part of the transaction fees will go back towards the pot.

So even now if you have 1k sitting in a savings account earning .01%, why wouldn't you want to earn 5% ADA instead. That 1k right now will get you 355 ADA or about 17.75 ADA a year.

So make $10 in a savings account or make $50 if the value of ADA stays at it's current price, which it wont.",positive,0.9190987,2

It is still highly hypocritical (as I have said elsewhere multiple times) for the community to bash XRP holders while simultaneously declaring themselves the wolf on wall street (which didn't end well for him) on XMR.

As a community we need to realize that we won't go from 0 to 60 without hitting 10, 20, 30, etc. Saying things like Ripple is a ""status quo sucker"" just makes the community look stupid. Do you think we're going to just burn all paper money and instantly start using BTC and XMR? I mean even if ETH ends up controlling all aspect of human life, Do you think the status quo (Elites?) won't have a hand in its rise to power? Ripple is trying to bridge the gap by seeing a problem and solving it. Like every other business out there.

As for your XRP points. XRP does not have a CEO, Ripple does. The same way Monero has Latapie, Spagni, and anonymous others that can be attacked from code contributions. Like you said, they can try because there is always someone or something to attack. Its just easier to attack Ripple as a U.S. based company. Now the old argument, XRP is decentralized as the majority of nodes are not controlled by Ripple. You can look up all the nodes online and spin one up yourself if you'd like. If Ripple goes completely under from the SEC lawsuit it would actually be a good thing for XRP (in your eyes) since it would prove that Ripple has no control of it.

I'm amazed it gets such little public attention unsure Currently has the highest tps (don't be fooled by Solana numbers - they include failed tnx in their numbers), highest RWAs, MiCA compliant, advisory to UK Parliament, never needed to fork, zero downtime ever, price is currently ridiculously low, quantum secure, only blockchain that has python as native prog language,instant finality etc, etc
When crypto has mass adoption, public and institutions will want reliability, usability, security and integrity... I feel like it's a no-brainier for mid to longer term investors
Have a look at Hesbapay and EURD - digital European currency run on algorand. Bank of Italy too. Even Lavazza coffee uses it!
Just my thoughts but I can't see how this won't blow up within 5 years. They've also made huge developments in India, Europe and South America. 
Bitcoin is obviously a solid store of value. Eth feels like it's beginning to crack and needs roll ups for future use so I'm concerned about longevity. Solana just doesn't work well - would have thought they'd iron out the glitches by now. Just doesn't seem reliable for day to day commerce long term. Plus it's reputation can be a little shady with the amount of dodgy meme coins.
For me algorand just makes perfect sense so I've got in as early as I can. It's also worth noting that Marc Vanleberghe is the CMO - he was responsible for marketing android.
It's still early days in crypto in regards to mass adoption but things have started to move fast this past year. I think algo has solid credentials and foundation to move into the next stage of crypto use.
