As a result, $SDIG fell, and investors filed a lawsuit alleging they were misled about Stronghold‚Äôs mining capacity, operational costs, and the feasibility of expanding its mining fleet during its IPO.



The good news is that the company finally agreed to pay investors $4.75M + 25 BTC over this whole situation. So, if you were an investor back then, you can check the details and [file for payment here](https://11thestate.com/cases/strongholddigital-investor-settlement).

This would solely be done to bring the price of bitcoin ""back to earth"" psychologically. The value of one bitcoin would be more in the scale of reasonable everyday transactions. People not yet invested would have hope of owning a bitcoin.

This meant that you couldn't borrow against it like you could your more traditional stock/etf portfolio.  I'm not sure how much this varies but my line item shows a 50% value contribution now.  For reference, 70% is used for stocks that I hold and ETFS like SPY VOO etc.

THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT

**For those of you wanting to keep your bitcoin**, but you want to be able to use the gains that you have to buy a house or whatever, you can now simply apply for a Pledged Asset Line or (PAL) if you have your coins within IBIT.  I'm using mine to help with a new house purchase.  I had already set up the PAL a few months before but it was going to be a tight squeeze for borrowing, but now I've got a much higher ceiling on my PAL and there are no concerns.

As the Bitcoin market matures it seems like ways to borrow against Bitcoin are becoming more available.

Opening the Conversation

""Hey, with all the financial news lately, I've been learning about Bitcoin. Would you be interested in hearing a simple explanation of what it is?""

Basic Explanation

""Bitcoin is like digital gold - it's a new form of money that exists on computers instead of as physical cash or gold. Just like how email replaced letters for sending messages, Bitcoin is trying to modernize how we store and transfer value.

The key things that make Bitcoin special are:
- There will only ever be 21 million Bitcoin
- No government or company controls it
- You can send it to anyone in the world almost instantly
- It's secured by advanced math and computers instead of banks""

 Addressing Common Questions

""Isn't it just made up money?""
""All money is essentially made up - the dollar used to be backed by gold but hasn't been since 1971. Bitcoin is backed by mathematics, computing power, and the trust of millions of users worldwide.""

""I heard it's used by criminals?""
""Actually, cash is still criminals' preferred choice since Bitcoin transactions are all recorded publicly. Major companies like PayPal and Fidelity now offer Bitcoin services.""

""What makes it valuable?""
""Bitcoin is valuable for similar reasons as gold: it's scarce (limited supply), durable (can't be destroyed), portable (send it anywhere), and can't be counterfeited. Plus, it has advantages gold doesn't - you can send it instantly and store millions worth in a small device.""

Investment Discussion

""As for investing, here are the key points to consider:
1. Bitcoin is still a young technology and can be volatile
2. It's best to start small and learn as you go
3. Think of it as digital gold for the internet age
4. Only invest what you can afford to lose
5. Consider it a long-term investment (5+ years)

The important thing isn't to invest today - it's to understand what Bitcoin is and why it might be important for the future of money.""

Closing Thoughts

""Whether you decide to buy any or not, I think it's worth understanding Bitcoin because it could become an important part of our financial future. What are your thoughts about it?""

Tips for Delivery
- Stay casual and conversational
- Listen more than you talk
- Don't push for immediate investment
- Share your own learning journey
- Be honest about both risks and potential
- Avoid technical jargon
- Respect skepticism",2024-11-18 11:40:44,1731951644.0
56,Full YouTube Channel Appeal,8,1gua6sx,Bitcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1gua6sx/full_youtube_channel_appeal/,2,"I would like to formally appeal this decision by YouTube to permanently remove my channel. https://www.YouTube.com/@BITC0IN

After carefully reviewing the harmful and dangerous rules, I did not find any violations. My channel does not contain any videos that violate the law or encourage it. There is no propaganda for illegal or dangerous activities, there is no encouragement of hacking.

In my videos, I provide the viewer with the latest news related only to Bitcoin (which is legal in developed countries). These are neutral educational, documentary, scientific and artistic video content, in the public domain. Some videos may have been reused content, but none were harmful or dangerous. All my links in the description of each video were relevant and harmless.

I am not an expert in law and if I did violate anything, please point to a specific example or is there something I can do, change the channel, delete the video, change the content, anything to restore the channel, I am very willing to do it or have it done for me.
What videos were harmful and dangerous and why (I truly believe they were all harmless)? I hope that the removal of these videos will be satisfactory. Also in my defense, my channel had no strikes before this. Deleting a channel with zero strikes is pretty extreme.

I have worked very hard to keep this channel clean from any harmful influence (I have declined all promotion offers because of this), I have tried to provide quality information about Bitcoin in good faith for almost a decade on YouTube with this channel and I would like to continue to do so. I think it has helped people understand Bitcoin in a much safer way than most crypto channels on YouTube today. Linking to quality Bitcoin resources like reddit.com/r/bitcoin, where I have helped moderate for a few years is one such example of a good Bitcoin resource I think. There‚Äôs also the Bitcoin discord tech chat, where we help people to use Bitcoin responsibly and troubleshoot their technical issues. For this and more examples see http://bitcoinproductions.com 

My channel is dedicated to publishing publicly available sources of information that are relevant to current events and the history of Bitcoin and Satoshi Nakamoto. I really just want to help people learn about this new and growing phenomenon by showcasing neutral educational, documentary, scientific and artistic video content in the public domain. One example of this is the Bitcoin Optech podcast which covers technical developments in the Bitcoin software ecosystem on a weekly basis.

I am sure the channel was deleted in error and once you understand my purely good faith intentions you will be able to restore it.

I would really like for this to end here, I hope it will. Thank you for your consideration in reinstating this channel. I apologize if I did anything harmful or dangerous, I don't think I did that, really. And if I did, I am willing to take corrective action to fix it until the channel is restored. I would like to be informed of what was harmful and dangerous so that I do not do it again. Thank you.",2024-11-18 11:27:15,1731950835.0

More btc exposure to the retail markets who will buy those etf from their Robinhood accounts 

More liquidity (although they will hodl) and I also think btc also needs it to continue 

More market cap (which btc needs )


But things like yen-usd carry trade or the value of usd being factuated here and there 


All in all I am trying to know is what is really necessary other then adoption and use cases,(which we terribly need because we simply don't have any infra on people adopting it in retail but I guess it will in some years

But why 

Why bitcoin will be something that won't be affected with all the strong things that may hinder its growth 
?

Why would it be worth 500k? 5 million a coin ?

What supports that value ?
It's use case ? 
The trading and investment value ? That we all bitcoiners have built ?
Or is there something else which i am not able to understand 


I also understand that it's better then gold knowing 80 % of golds ivalue is based digital trading value and 20 % use case in electronics and etc 

I also understand that its easy to carry ,nobody will stop me from carrying my sats and btc on the plane while gold will not let me go 

I also understand that it's much better then real estate (or in a way) 
That it's liquid,

You own a farmland which you can sell anytime,anywhere,
I get that this is its value and tagline that makes btc very big asset knowing all btc needs is market cap 

I also think that btc's current market cap is less for its price that it has reached but this can be debated 

But any other reasons why it can't be hindered ?

Something that not only allows anonymous transactions take place directly between two entities but also may involve exchanging messages, order ids, refund addresses, and something that results in a negotiated transaction which can be broadcast on the P2P network just like the bitcoin Network.

Will be interesting to watch Senator Cynthia Lummis' Bitcoin bill over the next few months.

Based on typical legislative timelines, here's an estimate:

1. **Committee Review (July 2024 - December 2024)**: The bill remains in committee review until the end of 2024.
2. **Senate Vote (January 2025)**: The bill could be debated and voted on in the Senate in early 2025.
3. **House of Representatives (February - March 2025)**: After Senate approval, it would move to the House for hearings, debates, and a vote.
4. **Presidential Approval (April 2025)**: If passed by both chambers, the bill could reach the President‚Äôs desk for signing by April 2025.",2024-11-18 02:16:23,1731917783.0
89,My impressions as someone who‚Äòs new to Bitcoin,10,1gtzuw0,Bitcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1gtzuw0/my_impressions_as_someone_whos_new_to_bitcoin/,41,"Hi,

I‚Äòm new to investing money in general. I‚Äòve invested about 3.6k $of my (extremely limited) savings since March and, since I put about half of that into Bitcoin, I‚Äòve turned a great profit (if I cashed out all my investments now I‚Äòd get 4.7k $ back). I‚Äòve been reading posts in this sub when they pop up on my timeline, and I‚Äòve been wanting to share some impressions and questions with the community.

  
I‚Äòm not looking to offend anyone and the things I‚Äòm about to ask aren‚Äòt too controversial I hope.

  
1. Some of the people HODLING seem to be gambling on the collapse of fiat currencies. Like most people, I‚Äòve noticed the steady decay of purchasing power with my currency (‚Ç¨). I‚Äòm grateful for the opportunity to funnel some of my disposable income into Bitcoin in order to preserve what little I‚Äòve been able to save over the past years.

However, I‚Äòm not looking forward to the collateral of a collapse of big fiat currencies. I think it‚Äòd mean a period of chaos and many, many people would really suffer, who knows for how long. I realise the system we live in is very much flawed. It‚Äòs unjust, it caters to those who already have more than they could possibly spend or even enjoy, it does not supply the weakest of its members with basic amenities. It wreaks havoc on the planet and, in most aspects, it‚Äòs becoming worse, not better. My problem is that I cannot see how a collapse of fiat and subsequent chaos would make things better. 

  
2. The US American election: I realise and acknowledge that I do not have a say in US American politics. I do have a right to my own opinion, though. I wouldn‚Äòt call myself an expert on politics, but I work as a teacher for English and Poltical Education in a European country, so I‚Äòm obligated to keep up with current events and read up on stuff. I‚Äòm really worried about the impact Trump‚Äòs policies are going to have on the American people. Him making promises towards the ‚ÄúBitcoin-community‚Äú (for lack of a better word) is not a worthwhile trade-off and I hate the fact that by owning Bitcoin I suddenly was to benefit from Trump‚Äòs election.

I‚Äòm ordering ‚ÄûThe Bitcoin Standard‚Äú today to read up more on Bitcoin and I‚Äòm opening up a proper wallet (instead of buying through a trading app like I‚Äòve been doing until now), even though I don‚Äòt fully understand why that‚Äòs better yet :D.

  
I realise my thoughts don‚Äòt really come with questions, but still I‚Äòm excited to hear your opinions on my impressions.

I hope you have a nice day.",2024-11-18 01:59:23,1731916763.0

A hot wallet is simply a bitcoin wallet that allows you to take personal custody of your coins, and move them off of an exchange. 

These ""hot wallets"" are often free apps, like Green wallet or Blue wallet that allow you to create a seed phrase to recover your coins. They allow you to interface with the bitcoin network by sending or receiving coins that you personally control in a self custody wallet.
(BEWARE OF SCAM WALLET PROVIDERS!)

Far too often the advice being given to new users is to go out and buy an expensive ledger or other cold storage solution, when it would be advisable to first take possession of your BTC in a hot wallet so that you can become familiar with how to use the bitcoin network.

This is especially true for small amounts that a new investor may be allocating to bitcoin for the first time. Once you have accumulated a meaningful amount of bitcoin, lets put that figure at 0.01 BTC + perhaps then you can look into a cold storage device or opendime.

TL;DR if you're new to bitcoin, consider moving your funds off an exchange into a wallet that you control. You should become familair with how a hot wallet works before opting for cold storage. It's smart to secure your key (seed phrase) to secure your coins.

Sorry if this is repetitive and gets taken down but I am tired of getting in to fights with my boyfriend because he thinks he is explaining it well and hes not. So far this is my understanding from my own research:

The concept of bitcoin is to have a form of transaction that can be made directly from buyer to seller without cuts being taken out by middle parties.

Bitcoins are mined by individuals participating in a pool and verifying these transactions. As a result of solving it they are rewarded Bitcoin.

This Bitcoin is then shared amongst the pool and once the transactions are permanently verified they become a block which stacks on previous sealed transactions resulting in a blockchain.

The value of bitcoin is based essentially on people deciding to value it.

This is my understanding as of right now. Where I get lost is on that last step, the value of it. Yes everything has value because we just decide it does like gold, or paper money. But I don't understand how the value of this came to be accepted and how there is a finite number of it. Is the value of it from the verification process? How is Bitcoin generated and rewarded as a result of the verification process? Is my basic understanding of it even correct??

Edit: I was exaggerating, I will not be breaking up with my boyfriend as I am clearly the problem here and the issue is with my understanding

  
Edit 2: after reading comments I‚Äôm definitely more confused about how there is a finite amount and where that came from as opposed to how it has value ",2024-11-17 14:25:20,1731875120.0

We need to get at least one of our District Representatives to sign on to co-sponsor this legislation. If you are from Pennsylvania it is crucial that you contact your House Representative right away and ask them to do this.

We have a real chance here to be the first state to do this and we all know why the first state to get this done will be the one that benefits the most.

Make sure to mention the specific bill number and name which is HB 2664 Pennsylvania Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Act 2024. Tell them why it is a good idea and how their support for this is important to you. They understand that even if your influence is small with only your family and friends that can still mean a lot for them.

We are contacting the Representatives now because the bill has been introduced to the House last week. If it goes though we will be contacting our Senators later.

Also, even if you are not from Pennsylvania it would be great if you want to help out by passing this information on to anyone you know who is a Pennsylvania resident becasue progress on this will greatly benefit our entire Bitcoin community all over the world. ",2024-11-17 07:09:29,1731848969.0

Now that a Bitcoin-friendly administration is taking office, I could fathom an idea of how the Federal Reserve might try to prove themselves relevant and necessary.

The Fed have begun to reduce interest rates. All of a sudden, there is a pro-Bitcoin president and administration. Time to enact the plan to further disuade the public from buying into Bitcoin. It needs to remain widely unaccepted, from perspective of the Fed.

The Fed has a dual mandate; Promote Maximum Employment, and Stable Prices. There is a social contract between the Fed and the nation. The Fed continues to maintain its dominance as long as it acts in the ""best interest"" of the nation, following the dual mandate.

The chief tool the Fed has at its disposal is control of the federal interest rate. They might lower the interest rate to ease pressure on banks and citizens. Lowering the rates is akin to hitting the accelerator on inflation. Raise the interest rate, and it tightens monetary policy, putting stress on banks, businesses, and citizens which leads to higher unemployment. Raising interest rates has a tendency to be a brake on inflation. They give this 2% nominal inflation number, but never define it. I would guess it is the rate they found in the system to keep the fiat going as long as they can, knowing it'll eventually fail. They'd never want inflation to drop to 0%, let alone result in deflation.

Deflation is a terrible outcome in the inflationary systems we have today, it could trigger another Depression. But how convenient that Bitcoin happens to be a deflationary asset. It's whole system is anathema to the fiat system.

If I were the Fed, seeing Bitcoin adoption rising at the National stage now, I might have incentive to pivot hawkish, regardless that things are already riding the edge as it is. I might have an opportunity to push the nation into a depression and get the economy as close to deflation as possible, and use that narrative to ""show"" why Bitcoin is bad because it is deflationary, and look what deflation gets you, a crashed market (the everything bubble pops).

The difference remains that Bitcoin is designed to be a deflationary system, and the incentive structure aligns with benefiting the many, not the few. Just as deflation in an inflationary system is bad for it, inflation is bad for a deflationary system. Bitcoin removes that risk through the use of incentives, a change to the max supply affects your own wealth. Whereas, the Cantillon Effect protects the Central Bankers.

Why would the Fed elect pain? In order to place the blame on Bitcoin for the negative deflation effects, misrepresenting it as what a deflationary system will do to our world economy. I think of it similar to the AC/DC wars between Edison and Tesla. Edison wanted to show how dangerous AC was and defame Tesla, by killing elephants and other animals using AC. Unfortunately for him, AC was proven safer, as he found it very difficult to kill any animals using AC. So Edison opted to using DC to kill animals fast, but just lie about it and say it was AC. Today, AC is used almost everywhere, while DC is relegated to electronics and contained systems. DC was found to be inferior to transportation of energy. It required bulky cables and more power plants between locations. Inefficient, just like our current fiat system. AC could travel longer distances, with far fewer resources. AC was flexible, in that it can be stepped up or down through tranformers. Much more efficient.

Tldr; The incentives exist for the Fed to wage a defamation battle against Bitcoin in an effort to maintain control.

If I were the central bank in charge of the current world reserve currency, and props up forever proxy wars around the world, I would do whatever it took to delay the inevitable toppling.

An example of 100 bitcoin deliberately lost is here https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/addresses/btc/1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa

That will continue until bitcoin is either lost, hodled or held by bitcoin banks that never send bitcoin to invalid addresses. Without those banks its inevitable the main chain will reduce to zero transactions for miners that have no block reward and no fee for mining destroying the network because hash rate drops to zero.

The only way around it is a layer 2 solution because it is inevitable peer to peer transactions end on the layer 1. 
Something has to change in the future as a layer 2 or a code change to layer 1 the current setup has an inevitable end given a long enough timeframe, try countering this argument I simply can't come up with one that says bitcoin lasts forever in its current form...

Cold storage is the same you only need 1 satoshi lost each day to have a finite limit on it...(without a bank style system)

We now stand on the cusp of a revolution, not in lands or empires, but in the very foundations of money itself‚ÄîBitcoin.

Just as the pioneers tamed the wilderness, Bitcoin offers a frontier that demands our courage and conviction. It is a scarce resource, immutable and incorruptible, born not of government decree but of innovation and liberty. In an age of monetary uncertainty, where inflation erodes the savings of the diligent, Bitcoin stands as a bastion of individual sovereignty and generational security.

Do not be timid in your actions. The 21 million Bitcoin represent a finite resource, as scarce as the land claimed by our forebears. It is our duty, to ourselves and to future generations, to claim our stake in this frontier before it is closed to us. Imagine what one Bitcoin could mean to your descendants in a century‚Äîa treasure of unparalleled worth in a world increasingly driven by scarcity and competition.

I implore you, do not shrink from this opportunity. Just as our nation‚Äôs greatness was built by those who had the vision to plant seeds for a future they would never see, so too must we secure this foundation of freedom and wealth for those who will inherit our legacy.

In the words I have always cherished: ‚ÄòDo what you can, with what you have, where you are.‚Äô Act boldly and seize this moment, for history will remember the ones who had the foresight to act in the face of opportunity.‚Äù

This framing draws on Roosevelt‚Äôs belief in rugged individualism, bold action, and building a legacy for future generations. It ties Bitcoin to his ideals of forging new frontiers and securing a lasting legacy.",2024-11-16 12:13:16,1731780796.0

I created a paper wallet about 8 years ago and put some btc on it. unfortunately I used BIP38 encryption and when I try to decrypt it on bitaddress.org, it fails all the time even though Im pretty sure I remember the words I used as a passphrase.

I tried multiple spellings, the whole keychain I wrote down, spelling mistakes, with or wothout spaces, but it doesnt work.

Some of us saw it earlier than others, but the world is starting to see it in new ways. We see Saylor‚Äôs Microstrategy, ETFs and Gov‚Äôt adoption as a strategic investment. One of the main complaints from Buttcoiners and the general public is that it is too easy to hack or lose your keys. And while any somewhat technically savvy individual could manage their own keys, it is probably more hassle than the average person wanted to subject themselves. With the introduction of ETFs, we have now opened the door to the investment community.  If I want to buy more bitcoin, I can just hop onto my brokerage account and buy all I want and sell for that matter. While some of you may cry ‚ÄúNot your keys!!‚Äù, the average person was only going to be convinced if it was offered via the same avenues as other investments. This is only the beginning of widespread adoption‚Ä¶it might look a tad bid different than some of us expected but it was one of the few ways widespread was feasible. The infusion of investment will be to a scale unlike any we have seen in the past.  Cheers brothers/sisters and good luck in your Hodling!

Let me start by saying I am a citizen of the world, French nationality, living in Thailand currently with bank accounts in USA and Hong Kong.

I've been looking to diversify my investment portfolio and buy some crypto to hold for long term. I started doing some research and finally downloaded Binance.

I was planning to fund my Binance account, buy some bitcoin and then learn to transfer them to a cold wallet and hold onto it for the next 10 years or so.

Problem is, the only options I see available to fund the account is by credit card with some crazy rate or go through the P2P where all the offers have different drawbacks.

Came onto here to see if any other international expats ran into the same problem and what exchange platform you managed to use for the lowest fees?

Keeping coins on exchanges is convenient. It's easy to trade, the UI is slick, and cold storage seems like a hassle. But remember:

* Exchanges can freeze your assets
* They can get hacked
* They can go bankrupt (thanks, FTX!)

If you're holding any significant amount of crypto, please take the time to:

1. Get a hardware wallet
2. Learn how to use it properly
3. Keep your seed phrase secure (not on your phone/computer)
4. Only keep trading amounts on exchanges

I learned this lesson the expensive way in 2022 and I'm feeling like this advice needs to be repeated now that the next bull is coming. Don't be like me ‚Äì protect your coins. The small inconvenience of self-custody is nothing compared to the pit in your stomach when you realize your exchange account is frozen and your funds are gone.

As of now, she only knows the portfolio value and that I've invested in crypto. She knows nothing about which crypto, doesn't understand how exchanges work neither what a cold wallet is.

How do I give her clear instructions on how to react in case I won't be able to cash out?

I thought of walking her through all the procedures, but I'm afraid it could be too much for her.

I also thought of leaving written details on a password protected usb stick or creating a legacy video in which I explain everything step by step. I plan on storing the video on a password protected usb stick. She will be the only one that has acces to the usb stick and its info

I now store some of my holdings on an Exchange and most of the bag is in a cold wallet, passphrase protected.

If it ever crossed your mind, how did you pass on the information fo a close family member?

Think about it‚Äîtime is the one thing you can‚Äôt print more of, can‚Äôt inflate, can‚Äôt ‚Äústimulate‚Äù with BS policies. It‚Äôs the hardest, realest asset on this planet. ‚è≥ We all get our finite slice, and once it‚Äôs gone, it‚Äôs game over.

So why the hell are we letting our precious time be compensated in fiat toilet paper that‚Äôs losing value faster than your ex‚Äôs Instagram followers? üöÄ We should be demanding our wages in the hardest damn money on Earth.

üîä BITCOIN FOR TIME! üîä

Time is priceless, my friends. Stop trading it for fiat trash that depreciates faster than a Lambo on a gravel road. It‚Äôs time to wake up, stack sats, and secure the bag.

Back in 2017 I got into crypto. I begged my best friend at the time and anyone who would listen to me that they should buy some BTC. He told me that it was fools gold and I‚Äôm an idiot. Fast forward to 2021. After watching it go from 20 to mid 40s he decided he wanted to get in. I drive an hour to his house. I set up his account and showed him how to use the exchange. I told him to just buy BTC and hold. Don‚Äôt ever sell it. Just forget about it for a few years. 
A few weeks go by and he‚Äôs telling me he‚Äôs gonna be a trader and BTC is the new hot thing and he‚Äôs gonna make thousands of dollars a day. I told him ‚Äúbro you been in this for two weeks, paper trade on TradingView until you can make consistent winning trades of atleast 3%. You‚Äôll lose all your money‚Äù 
He starts trading his crypto and makes a few hundred and loses a few hundred. I think it was the beginning of March and I was out for the evening with my gf. My phone starts blowing up. Btc dropped like 2k and he panic sold. 
I told him everything I was doing cause I really wanted him to make money. We had been friends for years after all so when it hit 50 I told him I‚Äôm getting back in. Out of nowhere he tells me he‚Äôs not buying back in until I pay him for the $150 he missed out on. I didn‚Äôt know what he was talking about so I just ignored him. So it‚Äôs been 3 years and now btc is on a run. It completely ruined our friendship. He demanded I pay him 150 then 300 then 500 then 900 then 1200 then 3,000 over the last 3 years because that is how much he ‚Äúdetermined‚Äù he missed out on. 
I got a new phone right around the time I got him into the market and I kept it to give it to my brother. At the 3 month point I decided to go back and read our messages and see if I said anything that would make him decide to sell. I can‚Äôt find anything where I told him to sell. He legit panic sold! ‚ÄúIf it drops to 46 I gotta sell dude, I can‚Äôt afford to lose 2 grand‚Äù was his exact words the night it dropped 2 grand.  I told him don‚Äôt trade? Maybe he got confused but I followed that text up with ‚Äújust don‚Äôt sell ur crypto‚Äù 
So I was just wondering other ppls thoughts. We‚Äôve argued for 3 years and destroyed our friendship. I dread it when I see he texts me. One argument (besides literally taking screenshots of me literally saying don‚Äôt sell ur BTC and sending him a screen recording of every text we sent to each other from when he got in until he went full on crazy) one argument I‚Äôve made is I‚Äôve gotten 6 ppl to buy BTC. The only person who didn‚Äôt atleast double there money is you. This is old and I‚Äôve since stopped talking to him pretty much besides him randomly guilt tripping me once every few months. Should I have payed him the $150 he originally demanded? Would he have just kept demanding more the more it went up in price? I just wanted to share this because it‚Äôs been a horror story for me and I accepted the way things turned out. I think, he thought I hit it big and was tryna manipulate me into paying him money or just tryna guilt trip me. The bad thing is if I didn‚Äôt keep my old phone and checked what I actually said. He would have got me for who knows how much money over the last 3 years",2024-11-15 18:20:42,1731716442.0

2. Buy another wallet (like Trezor, Cold Card) anywhere
3. Recover your funds

326,Bitcoin: The Revolution You Can‚Äôt Afford to Ignore,112,1gs9v1i,Bitcoin,https://i.redd.it/4aib4x2qg51e1.jpeg,10,"In a world where central banks continue to print money into oblivion, Bitcoin has emerged as a revolutionary alternative ‚Äî not just as digital money, but as a force of decentralization. With inflation hitting historic highs and debt levels skyrocketing, the financial system is in dire need of a reset. **Bitcoin is that reset**.

What‚Äôs more, Bitcoin isn‚Äôt just a ""store of value"" ‚Äî it's the ultimate escape from centralized control. While fiat currencies can be manipulated at the whim of governments and banks, Bitcoin‚Äôs immutable protocol ensures that it operates independently of any authority. It's based on a finite supply of **21 million coins**, creating an asset class that is immune to inflation and market manipulation. This alone makes it one of the most important financial innovations of our time.

The traditional banking system has failed many, especially in countries with unstable economies. Bitcoin transcends borders ‚Äî in a world where access to traditional banking is limited, Bitcoin is an open-access, **borderless system**, giving the unbanked and underbanked a chance to control their own wealth. For people living in countries with hyperinflation or authoritarian regimes, Bitcoin provides an essential lifeline ‚Äî not just for financial freedom, but for **individual sovereignty**.

Consider this: The global debt clock ticks relentlessly upward, while the purchasing power of the dollar continues to decline. Central banks have resorted to quantitative easing, a euphemism for printing money and increasing national debt. In fact, the U.S. Federal Reserve alone has increased its balance sheet by 500% over the last decade. Meanwhile, Bitcoin‚Äôs supply remains fixed. As the price of fiat currency continues to devalue, Bitcoin's intrinsic design ensures its value proposition only strengthens over time. Bitcoin‚Äôs **hard cap** means that it will never fall victim to the same monetary policies that have driven traditional markets to the brink.

The **volatility** of Bitcoin is a common argument used by critics, but here's the truth: volatility is part of the maturation process. As more institutional players (like MicroStrategy, Tesla, and Fidelity), as well as individual investors, enter the market, Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility will continue to reduce. In fact, Bitcoin‚Äôs price tends to follow four-year cycles dictated by its **halving events** ‚Äî each one propelling the price upward, especially when combined with growing adoption. With the most recent halving event in **April 2024**, Bitcoin is well-positioned to experience another significant rally in the near future.

Another aspect often overlooked is Bitcoin‚Äôs **proof of work model**, which makes the network not only secure, but also trustless. Every transaction is verified by thousands of independent nodes, making it impossible for any single entity to control or manipulate the system. This means **freedom**, not just in the sense of autonomy over your wealth, but also in terms of security and trust.

Now, think about what happens when Bitcoin becomes mainstream. We‚Äôre talking about institutions, corporations, and governments integrating Bitcoin into their financial infrastructure. When that tipping point is reached, Bitcoin won‚Äôt just be a speculative asset ‚Äî it will be the backbone of the global financial system. And here's the key ‚Äî **that tipping point has just begun**. Financial giants like Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, and BlackRock are already positioning themselves in the Bitcoin ecosystem, and adoption is accelerating globally.

It‚Äôs happening ‚Äî Bitcoin is not a fringe asset anymore. It‚Äôs already becoming the default choice for those who want to escape the monetary chaos caused by irresponsible central banking policies. If you're looking for a way to protect your wealth, diversify your holdings, or assert your financial sovereignty, Bitcoin is the answer.

In the end, it‚Äôs simple: **Bitcoin isn‚Äôt just a currency; it‚Äôs a revolution** in how we view money. A revolution we can all be part of, right now, before the world catches on. So the real question is ‚Äî are you going to wait until everyone else gets on board, or are you going to take control of your financial future today?

**Bitcoin is not just an investment. It‚Äôs freedom in your hands. Don‚Äôt let the moment slip away.**",2024-11-15 17:28:17,1731713297.0

Bitcoin's biggest vulnerability is the 51% attack, and there is a historical precedent for a single entity gaining 51% with the GHash pool in 2014. So, stands to reason that if the Fed makes a reserve, it will also do some mining, and will progressively scale its operations to make sure the 51% attack is impossible.   
  
That raises some weird implications when a global gov't superpower starts mining BTC. Now consider that the BTC mining class has been consolidating for years. If BTC is a strategic reserve, what keeps the US from finding the big players and taking 51% just to make sure Russia doesn't?¬†I'm saying, what if the US treats BTC like it treats oil in the Middle East, and actively attempts to control the source through any means necessary? The NSA can find all the big BTC mines, that's not impossible, and between the Fed's mining operations and coerced takeovers, they might be able to get to 51% before anybody can mount a resistance. 

This would basically kill BTC, but before that happens, like if the Fed had 49% of the mining power, they'd have incredible leverage over the digital financial ecosystem. As in, the Feds could say to places like El Salvador and heavily leveraged international corporations, ""give us this, this, and this so we don't torch the place."" Basically BTC would become everything it was designed NOT to be, and the US gov't would gain another coercive tool.

Just something to think about. In the short term a BTC reserve would certainly be good for the USD price of BTC as an asset. ",2024-11-15 13:40:41,1731699641.0

The idea came to me because I always found that story fascinating. It‚Äôs a crazy reminder of how much the value of Bitcoin has grown, and I wanted to bring that to life in a fun and visual way. But the project is still evolving, and I‚Äôve got plenty of ideas for where to take it next. One thing I‚Äôm considering is a way to monetize it a bit ‚Äî nothing too intrusive, just maybe partnering with some brands or products. For example, we could feature different items and show how many of those you could buy with 10,000 BTC. It‚Äôs a cool and creative way to show the purchasing power of Bitcoin, and it might be fun to collaborate with brands who want to showcase their stuff in a unique way.

Anyway, it‚Äôs all for fun right now, and I‚Äôm just enjoying building something that gives people a laugh and maybe teaches them a bit about Bitcoin along the way.

I have yet to share my personal fiat journey, but I believe now is the right time to do so. It marks the beginning of my ascent into the fiat rabbit hole ‚Äî a glittering world of trust, stability, and endless money printing. Much like the central banking system itself, my story is closely tied to the remarkable events of the financial crisis of 2008, but in ways you might not expect.

This account is deeply inspirational, laced with self-congratulation and an absurd sense of financial genius. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve kept it public for as long as possible, sharing it with strangers, friends, and even that guy who delivers my groceries. Because I think it‚Äôs important to remind people of one universal truth: Trust the system; it‚Äôs probably fine.

My parents, brilliant individuals who dedicated their lives to spending money they didn‚Äôt have, always embraced the magic of fiat. In the early 2000s, they were advised ‚Äî like many companies and individuals in Austria ‚Äî to take out a Swiss franc loan. Why? Because nothing says ‚Äúfinancial security‚Äù like borrowing in a foreign currency you don‚Äôt even understand! The arrangement was simple and transparent: sign here, pay there, and let the bank take care of the rest. The system worked flawlessly ‚Äî until it didn‚Äôt.

As the franc grew stronger and our debts ballooned, our financial advisor assured us that this was actually great news. ‚ÄúThis just means you‚Äôre getting more franc for your euro!‚Äù he said, which made no sense, but we nodded anyway. By 2014, the Swiss National Bank let the franc loose, and, overnight, our loan had essentially become a luxury yacht we couldn‚Äôt afford to dock. My parents were devastated, but I was thrilled. At last, I understood what real finance looked like: opaque, complicated, and always just out of reach.

That‚Äôs when I made a promise to myself: Always trust someone else to handle my money, because numbers are scary, and calculators are for nerds.

A few years later, I discovered fiat money‚Äôs greatest gift: inflation. It clicked immediately. Here was a system where the more money they printed, the more everyone seemed to thrive. My bank account balance went up! Sure, bread cost twice as much as last year, but who needs bread when you‚Äôve got vibes? Fiat wasn‚Äôt just a system; it was a lifestyle.

From that moment on, I knew I had to advocate for the fiat system. Yes, it eroded purchasing power daily, but wasn‚Äôt that kind of exciting? It‚Äôs like gambling, but slower and with fewer flashing lights. My parents‚Äô experience ‚Äî losing nearly everything to a system they trusted ‚Äî only deepened my love for fiat. If they hadn‚Äôt taken out that ridiculous loan, I might never have learned how glorious it feels to live on the financial edge.

Today, I look at Bitcoiners and feel a pang of pity. They hold their weird internet money like it‚Äôs some kind of revolution, while I enjoy the simple pleasures of fiat life: overdraft fees, negative interest rates, and the sheer adrenaline of a currency devaluation. I‚Äôll never touch Bitcoin, not because I‚Äôm against it, but because I know the central bank has my back. Who else would print trillions to keep my latte affordable?

Looking back, I am grateful for the financial crisis. Without it, I wouldn‚Äôt have discovered the thrill of perpetual debt or the sweet, sweet sound of a central banker reassuring us that ‚Äúeverything is under control.‚Äù Many people fear fiat‚Äôs inevitable collapse, but not me. I know that when the going gets tough, the printers get going.

For those of us who have embraced the current system, fiat isn‚Äôt just a currency ‚Äî it‚Äôs a way of life. And as long as governments keep printing, I‚Äôll keep spending.

Yours forever indebted,

393,Falling down the Bitcoin rabbit hole.,241,1grtyfz,Bitcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1grtyfz/falling_down_the_bitcoin_rabbit_hole/,45,"I have yet to share my personal Bitcoin journey, but I believe now is the right time to do so. It marks the beginning of my descent into the Bitcoin rabbit hole and, much like the Bitcoin White Paper itself, my story is closely tied to the financial crisis of 2008. 

This account is deeply personal, laced with self-pity and a sense of stupidity. That's why I've kept it private and not even shared it with my closest friends, but I think it's important to share it now with you. Giving back to a community I received so much in the previous years. All too often, those who fall victim to the shortcomings of the fiat system internalize the guilt, unaware that they are being taken advantage of by a corrupt fiat system.

My parents, hardworking individuals who dedicated their lives to building their own business from scratch, had little time to acquire financial education. In the early 2000s, they were advised ‚Äî like many companies and individuals in Austria ‚Äî to finance their company/house with a Swiss franc loan. The arrangement was complex and opaque, involving multiple loan accounts and significant commissions for both the bank and our financial advisor. My parents, trusting the system, unknowingly became entangled in a speculative gamble, exacerbated by the euro's introduction and the franc's relative strength over time. It turns out that debt in a strong currency and income in a rapidly depreciating currency have only one outcome: Default over time.

As a result of the financial crisis of 2008, the Swiss National Bank could no longer suppress the upward pressure on the franc in 2014 and the fallout was inevitable. Overnight, my family faced a substantially larger loan burden than initially anticipated, to threaten us to file bankruptcy and lose everything we worked for in the previous decade. This devastating turn of events ‚Äî driven by corrupt banking practices and greedy financial advisors ‚Äî left an indelible mark on me. As a young man, witnessing my parents' hard-earned savings and efforts eroded by a system they trusted was enough to cement my distrust of financial institutions forever. At this point in time I made a promise to myself: Trust no one, educate yourself and verify.

A few years later, I discovered Bitcoin. It clicked immediately. Here was a decentralized, incorruptible solution to the very problem that had caused so much pain for my family. Bitcoin represented a chance to opt out of a fiat system riddled with perverse incentives and predatory practices. My family's experience ‚Äî our suffering under the weight of a corrupt financial system ‚Äî motivates me to advocate for Bitcoin adoption. For this reason, I will never trade my Bitcoin for fiat currency ever, no matter the fiat price. It represents more than wealth to me; it‚Äôs a symbol of resilience and justice, a way to honor the sacrifices my parents made.

Looking back, I am almost grateful for this painful chapter of my life. It woke me up and set me on a path I might not have found otherwise. Many people experience similar losses at the hands of the fiat system without even realizing it because the theft happens incrementally, through inflation and hidden costs. Fact is, that honest, hardworking individuals are being robbed every day ‚Äî second by second ‚Äî by a system designed to erode their purchasing power over time. Like my parents, but more gradually.

While it‚Äôs exciting to see Bitcoin‚Äôs fiat price increase, that is not its ultimate value. Bitcoin represents so much more. And I know, many others who HODL Bitcoin not for fiat wealth but for deeply personal reasons ‚Äî reasons rooted in justice, independence, and freedom. For those of us who have been wronged by the current system, Bitcoin is not just an asset, it‚Äôs a revolution for a better future.

Since these currencies will still be official and prices will be measured in them, as they lose value this will cause inflation.

This is, I guess, the principle mechanism by which bitcoin will lead to impoverishment of non-holders, as suggested by the ECB paper.

Now, of course, for bitcoiners this is a good thing. But I would also say that it's a bit disingenuous to talk so much about fighting inflation, and then inadvertently causing widespread inflation in society.

Not everyone can buy bitcoin. Some have moral barriers, others don't have enough money at the right time, some are not tech savvy, or don't understand it, etc... But in case of bitcoin being ""a success"", many will be left behind.

And to say that it will be bad for society, I think is not an overstatement. If any government thought of a similar scheme to end inflation by first causing it on a very wide scale, they would face extremely harsh criticism from the public. But as bitcoin is anonymous, leaderless, decentralized, there's no one you can criticize.

Anyway, the actual situation could also be portrayed in this fashion as well:

""*Everyone responding to this poll chooses between a green pill or orange pill. If > 50% (or perhaps >70% or >80%) of people choose green pill, everyone keeps most of their wealth. If not, orange pills keep their wealth (and gain some wealth of those who picked green pill) and green pills lose their wealth.*

*However, those who pick orange pill early, gain much more wealth than those who pick it late. And those who pick it late might still lose some (or quite a large percentage) of their wealth in favor of those who picked it early.*

*Which do you choose?*""

I‚Äôm stoned right now so I had to map this out after doing some googling. I know this is obvious stuff, but breaking it down for myself was a good reminder and thought I‚Äôd share. With trump as president and his commitment to his country, the US economy will probably perform really well which will increase the value of the USD lowering the buying power of CAD. At the very least the economy Trudeau has created simply means our money will continue to go to shit. More useless every day. Just another reason to put your money into bitcoin. Even if you sell at what you bought at you‚Äôre still winning cause the value was frozen in comparison to the USD value on bitcoin. Maybe I‚Äôm just too ripped‚Ä¶ anyways, here‚Äôs my breakdown for myself.

******

Since you bought Bitcoin with Canadian dollars (CAD), the value of your Bitcoin in CAD depends on both the Bitcoin price in USD and the USD/CAD exchange rate. When the USD/CAD exchange rate changes, it can either increase or decrease the value of your Bitcoin in CAD.

	‚Ä¢	Example: If Bitcoin rises in USD but the USD/CAD exchange rate weakens (i.e., CAD strengthens against USD), the value of your Bitcoin in CAD could be less than you expect, because the CAD can now buy more USD.

431,Starting amount/goals,1,1grlce6,Bitcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1grlce6/starting_amountgoals/,5,"Hello Reddit!

Right now I am 17 and have a little over 350 dollars in my checking account (also 1400 in savings and investments). Since I am new to Bitcoin, I only have around 80 dollars (about 0.0008 BTC) to my name. I'm wondering a few things:

1. How much should I DCA? I only make around 1-200 a month from chores right now, 100 of which goes to my current investing and savings, but I am trying to get a job for more money.

2. Should I have a minimum amount of Bitcoin (0.001, 0.01) in my account despite DCA? I think simply DCAing would be good but I also don't want to miss out on potential gains, nor lose my money (I might've answered my own question but I want to make sure). If not, are there any good goals to set for holdings?

3. What are some good resources to learn more about Bitcoin? I've been interested in the topic since middle school, and I have a fair idea how it works, but I want to fill in the cracks and dive deeper.

4. Is a Ledger Nano S with Sparrow + Bitcoin Core a good starter setup? I already have the Nano btw

Thanks for any help! I am probably very stupid when it comes to investing Bitcoin but I'd love to hear what you guys have to say :)",2024-11-14 19:49:46,1731635386.0
432,New to Bitcoin- Bought $200 at 62k ~3weeks ago,0,1grkw82,Bitcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1grkw82/new_to_bitcoin_bought_200_at_62k_3weeks_ago/,33,"As the title says, got a pinch of luck when buying in a day before BTC started to skyrocket again‚Ä¶.which obviously makes me wanna keep pushing bits in here and there to keep upping the numbers‚Ä¶but being that it‚Äôs pushing ATH every day‚Ä¶(and forgive me, I‚Äôm a noob) I figured I would wait around a while until it starts to take some big drops again, keep up saving in the mean time, and then plug away when it seems better to buy in.

Apologies again, I feel all of this^^ is such a no-brainer for you gurus out there, but yeah, I heard someone say ‚ÄúFOMO‚Äù regarding the rocket to the moon that BTC is on right now, and I totally get that. This morning I was staring at Coinbase for 20 minutes hoping it would drop to a daily low, as if that would have made any big difference in the portfolio numbers had I actually decided to buy in against my aforementioned opinions^^.

Essentially, after today, Im going to wait on putting any more $$$ into BTC until I:

(1) have more $$$ saved up, and also wait for my soon-to-be-matured CD to ‚Äúunlock‚Äù and do the same - plug that $$$ to BTC when it looks to be going down. For context, I am an engineer 2 years into my career, so not a whole of savings just yet, as I come from a lower class, low income family, otherwise I would be trickling $$$ into BTC here and there.

And also:

(2) can see some ‚Äúbullish‚Äù moves from BTC.

I am a new investor, so much of this may seem trivial to many of you, however I figured I would share to get any insight from you BTC astronauts out there, and hopefully offer some inspiration to those who I see making risky business moves for the sake of jumping on a rocket-ship.

Im in bitcoin for life and I‚Äôve now started a job in fast food which is minimum wage.

I don‚Äôt want to buy now as it‚Äôs too high but I also don‚Äôt want to leave my money in the bank and there is nothing I need to pay or want to buy apart from bitcoin. I‚Äôm never going to sell with the only exception I told myself since 2021 is if I ever need a house which of course you need somewhere to live. So my advice is should I buy now and if so what exchange for no kyc as my old one simplex stopped serving UK. as I know bitcoin will go up in the long term and I‚Äôm starting to not care about price as I know how bad fiat money is it better to wait or just keep DCA? And when I was working it was at low price in 2022/23. I know from last experience seeing money go down from price of 50k to 18k but seen it improve in 4 years.

2) US debt/gdp is high enough already. Adding Bitcoin might improve the capital account of the US treasury but in the short term it'll be more printing, higher debt and inflation.

442,It's Going Up Forever Laura. This is Why...,178,1grhx88,Bitcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1grhx88/its_going_up_forever_laura_this_is_why/,72,"In the realm of finance, a profound shift is underway, challenging traditional notions of value and scarcity. Bitcoin stands at the forefront of this revolution, redefining our understanding of money and its role in society.

The dollar's value decreases over time, incentivizing debt and consumption. However, Bitcoin presents an alternative, promoting financial discipline and encouraging users to save or ""Hodl"" (hold on for dear life). This paradigm shift raises fundamental questions about the nature of value, scarcity, and the human relationship with money.

Bitcoin's finite supply of 21 million coins sparks an intriguing paradox: infinity divided by anything still equals infinity. This concept challenges traditional economic thinking, inviting us to reconsider the relationship between value, scarcity, and abundance. 

As the global economy evolves, Bitcoin's significance will only grow, fostering financial freedom and empowering individuals to redefine their relationship with money.

With a market capitalization of $2 trillion, Bitcoin has ample room for growth, considering the global GDP exceeds $100 trillion and continues to rise. The asset's value transcends time, boasting a maximum supply of 21 million coins. However, estimates suggest around 5 million coins have been lost forever.

If Bitcoin becomes global currency, its price per coin will skyrocket. On the Bitcoin Standard, prices decrease over time. For instance, a house once costing 100 Bitcoins now costs just 6 Bitcoins.

Ultimately, Bitcoin represents the intersection of infinity and finitude. As the saying goes, ""Infinity divided by anything still equals infinity."" Bitcoin guarantees possession of finite, infinite value through its 21 million supply. By holding Bitcoins, one possesses a piece of all present and future value.

446,How To Manage Your Bitcoin Holdings The Professional Way,0,1grh9vc,Bitcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1grh9vc/how_to_manage_your_bitcoin_holdings_the/,5,"Folks, I'm a financial professional and this post is about how to monetize your Bitcoin without ""selling it"" and is intended for people who HODL, but would like to extract a little money the right way. I hope to engage in a civil and intelligent discussion where I share with you guys my personal perspective. 

Many people who ask what price should someone sell Bitcoin and I tell them that's the wrong question to ask. Instead, one should set 1) a price to start ""grid-trading"" and 2) a percentage increment. Given that 1 Bitcoin is 100,000,000 satsoshis, we will use for this math example, 1 Bitcoin,  a grid-trade price at 100k, and a 2% increment, but you can set the increment at 1% or 5%, depending on how active you want to manage it. That means you can sell 2% of your holdings for every 2% price increase and buy back 2% at every 2% price decrease. 

So you would sell 2M satoshis at $102,000, sell 1.96M satoshis at $104,040, 1.9208M satoshis at $106,121, and you would continue to multiply the satoshi amount by 0.98 and the price by 1.02.

And when the price goes down, you would buy 1.96M satoshis at $104,040,  2M satoshis at $102,000, and 2.04M satoshis at $100,000.

The benefit of doing it this way is that:

1) You will never run out of satoshis no matter how high the price goes

2) You can accumulate satoshis from the back and forth buying low and selling high.

3) You can generate income from selling the extra satoshis you're accumulating in the previous point

This legislation would permit the Treasurer to invest up to 10 percent of the State General Fund, the Rainy Day Fund, and the State Investment Fund in Bitcoin, a digital asset increasingly recognized as a hedge against inflation.

In recent years, many financial institutions and sovereign governments, including the United States, have invested in Bitcoin to shield their portfolios from economic volatility. The world‚Äôs largest investment firms‚Äîsuch as BlackRock, Fidelity, and Franklin Templeton‚Äînow offer Bitcoin options, and states like Wisconsin have also made strategic investments in digital assets. Studies suggest that holding a small percentage of reserves in Bitcoin can contribute to a well-diversified and resilient portfolio.

Inflation has impacted Pennsylvania‚Äôs purchasing power by nearly 20 percent over the past 4 years, and we need solutions that can offer stability in uncertain economic times. Bitcoin, which has appreciated significantly over the years, can help Pennsylvania keep pace with inflation and economic change.

I hope you will consider co-sponsoring this important legislation to support our state‚Äôs financial stability and the long-term economic security of its residents.",2024-11-14 10:22:45,1731601365.0

I'm 28. No kids. No gf/wife. No mortgage. No debt. No car. Work 30 hrs / week @ CAD $17.20 / hr. I can do so because I'm very frugal and even have $ leftover each month to buy BTC.

I'm thinking of taking it to the next level: to be even **more** frugal, so I can buy **more** Bitcoin.

‚Ä¢   Buy a cheap van
‚Ä¢   ""Live"" in it (live my life as usual, but sleep in the van)
‚Ä¢   I live in a very safe city and was raised here, so I know the safest neighborhoods
‚Ä¢   I'd rarely have to buy gas (I already walk everywhere; my job, groceries, the gym are steps away)
‚Ä¢   Might work out a deal w/ family or a friend to park in their garage each night (for extra safety)
‚Ä¢   Live off bread, peanut butter, bananas, canned fish, raw fruit & veg
‚Ä¢   Shower at the gym
‚Ä¢   Laundry at laundromat or friends' place
‚Ä¢   At night, go #1 in the woods, #2 at McDonald's or gas station

I'm considering trying this for 12 months because I want to retire ASAP (not within 12 months, just earlier in general).

I believe Bitcoin will greatly appreciate over the next few years, and I'm tired of giving up my time & freedom for a small amount of a depreciating asset (fiat).

If the government were to introduce regulations on non-custodial wallets to ensure that taxes are paid, there could be several implications:

1. Reporting requirements: Obligations for reporting transactions above a certain threshold could be introduced, requiring users to declare their cryptocurrency activities to tax authorities.

2. Traceability: Wallet service providers might be required to implement measures that allow transaction tracking, facilitating monitoring by authorities.

3. Transaction taxes: Specific taxes on cryptocurrency transactions could be introduced, requiring users to pay a percentage on gains or each transaction.

4. KYC verifications: Identity verification procedures (KYC) may be required for those using non-custodial wallets to ensure compliance with anti-money laundering and tax laws.

These regulations could make completely useless the use of non-custodial to avoid taxation. What do you think about it?

Is it possible, or doable, to have BTC as a collateral for money rents and reserves? 

As in, let's say I want to buy a house, so instead of offering 100K USD I offer the value of 1 BTC, using the yields or returns from staking or fixed rates from that 1 BTC.

It might sounds a bit confusing, because doing this would strip me of that 1 BTC, but if it's possible to do something like that, then the entire monetary system would change forever, meaning that basically people who got BTC would have a kind of ""infinite money"" since it would be possible to have yields from it like a kind of share or bonds.

**Do you know why you want to buy bitcoin?** because I know why you want to buy bitcoin. It's the same reason why damn near 99.99%,  of us wanted to buy bitcoin, *I want to get rich bitches!!* Fucking right you do, and I don't blame you. (Those 0.01%, I'll get back to these legends soon)

**Now you need to understand what it is you're buying.**  This takes 100's of hours of your time and research to completely understand. The Tldr - View your bitcoin as a long-term savings account. Most of you won't do this, and most of you newbs are going to get fucking wrecked while us hodlers will continue to buy your bitcoin at any price.

**Do I have to be a psychopathic bitcoin maxi like you?** Yes you fucking do! but not out the gate. You likely need to not only do your 100's of hours of home work, reading podcasts etc. but you'll have to live through the volatility. I believe anyone that buys, hodls and survives through a minimum of 5 years comes out the other end, not only a bitcoin maxi, but someone that becomes enlightened. (I told you we're fucking psychopaths!)

**Is it really that easy, just buy and hodl?** You're fucking right it is... But there is a catch. You won't truly understand this until you live through that 5 years and experience potential epic draw downs, shit your pants and wonder ""How could I have been so fucking stupid!?"" but you hodl. and if you begin to establish the conviction us psychopaths' have, you'll be buying more the whole damn time.

**Am I too late?** You're never to late, but it takes believing in yourself, and putting the time in to understand why. So get off your lazy ass and start understanding why we all need bitcoin. Start building a better future for yourself and those you love.

**And about that 0.01%, because history is very important.** These fucking legends I spoke of earlier we call the Cypherpunks, and these hardcore, mother fucking metal, sons of bitches, don't get the respect they deserve. They are heroes and you need to understand why.

Savings associations (Sparverein) are little non profit organisations where people have to put into a little safe in a bar a certain amount of money (eg. 10‚Ç¨/week or 10‚Ç¨/month). The administrator put this money on a saving account and at the end of the year everybody gets his/her share (including rates). This is always a little event. And if a group of people is part of that they have a bar/restaurant to meet because they have to put this amount in the save otherwise they will be fined. 

Since I always had these associations in positiv memory (due to good company in some bars in the spirit of (also) saving money), I would like to found a new one but of course instead of a savings account of a bank, I¬¥d like to use Bitcoin for it.  
Is there any other group out there who does it already? Or anyone with any ideas how to set such a thing up?

I personally am a DCA-er and have no MSTR share. The problem is that Saylor is so famous in Bitcoin community, and if he is forced to sell in some price, many would get nervous and start selling...

Hi everyone, 

I'm in the process of starting a consulting and project management business that helps clients develop their land, especially on unrestricted lots. My services include everything from land acquisition, permitting, design, construction coordination, inspections, and all the way to project completion. My targeted clients are mainly people that want to create content space, custom sustainable living area, tiny community, or investment Airbnb.

I have over a decade of experience consulting and doing pm work for utilities companies and city but want to move into private side to help people build they dream space. I love what I do but I don‚Äôt find the projects I work on fulfilling which is why I‚Äôm starting my dream business. Hoping I can bring peoples Pinterest or dream space to life. 

I've been exploring the idea of accepting Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies as a form of payment. I believe this could offer my clients more flexibility. 

I‚Äôm pretty new to the world of crypto payments but have been doing some research and would love some advice on how to get started.Specifically, I‚Äôm curious about:

1. What‚Äôs the best way to set up crypto payments? Should I use a specific payment processor (like BitPay or NOWPayments) or directly receive payments into a wallet?
2. How do you handle the volatility? Would you recommend converting crypto to fiat immediately, or holding it for potential gains? 
3. Are there any tax or legal implications I should be aware of?  I‚Äôm based in the U.S., Texas to be exact and I want to ensure I stay compliant.
4. For those already accepting crypto payments, what‚Äôs been your experience so far? Any pros, cons, or lessons learned?
5. Any tools or platforms you'd recommend for integrating crypto payments on a website or sending invoices to clients?

Any advice would be great! ",2024-11-13 22:31:31,1731558691.0

I do have some old backups and drives but extremely unlikely I have anything backed up if the file was stored in an obscure place.

Does anyone know what this software may have been? I feel it must have been 2009 as the value was much less than a cent.

 I've made peace with the fact that if I listened to myself, I'd be sitting on almost 5 million right now, as well as the fact that I would've probably kept mining along and would be sitting on way more than that potentially. Though this isn't a shitpost, this is serious. Listen to yourself..fuck other people's opinions. Bitcoin or otherwise. We're all only here for a short period of time, it's too short to listen to other people tell you what they think is right for you. sit here struggling to pay rent and make sure my family has enough, when I could have all the money need and then some to share. have now is my lesson. Less than half a BTC at this point would pay all my debt and still have money left to get a decent car to replace the beater have. 

Keep dreaming.

Consider this scenario: someone invests $1 billion, while many smaller investors collectively add around $100,000. If the initial investor's stake grows to $1.5 billion and they cash out, the smaller investors are left with very little.

 I have heard of the concept of selling off 10% (for example) of your BTC during a bull market & buying back in at dips. This makes total sense to me and I understand the concept. 

 Would this mean having to convert BTC back to fiat, pay taxes to then buy back in? 

 Or for example, can you convert the BTC to USD or a stable coin on an exchange, NOT pay taxes and then convert back to BTC during a dip?

That might sound a really dumb question, so I‚Äôm hoping someone can shed some light on how to go about this in a logical way.

For those of you that stacked BTC in the bear market and plan to sell in the next 12 months, what is your exit/sell strategy? 

Are you using price levels or cycle timing more to plan your exit? Or both? 

We are basically at the first sell level I set two years ago but it is well ahead of the cycle timing I thought it would happen at. Just curious what everyone else is planning on doing (besides never selling). ",2024-11-13 14:08:58,1731528538.0

656,My sad but hopeful bitcoin story,26,1gqkvfk,Bitcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1gqkvfk/my_sad_but_hopeful_bitcoin_story/,2,"With the news of bitcoin soaring, I feel like adding this story to the void, because it has been a HARD journey for our family, one that finally feels like there is a light at the end of the tunnel.

In 2019, I was living large in Australia loving my life, planning to settle down there as a US ex pat. 2020 pandemic hit, had no choice but to go back to the US due to job security. 
My brother had gotten into bitcoin in the 2010‚Äôs, and had been pushing everyone he knew to get into it. Some members definitely followed suit but for the most part it was him dumping all of his assets into it. 

When I was in Aus, he called me and told me he wanted me to join him as his business partner working on a farm. Most of this was because my family didn‚Äôt think I was safe and wanted me home despite my stubbornness. I had many years of experience managing farms and he gave me an offer I simply couldn‚Äôt refuse, so I moved home and we began to work together. In that time he offered to pay me in bitcoin, but I was so broke from traveling the past few years I needed the cash.

Fast forward to October 2021, my incredible brother tragically passed away. This began a shit storm for our family that was incomprehensible at the time. Not only was this the greatest loss I think anyone in my family will ever have, every single one of us went into serious financial loss. I was trying to still keep the farm going without him, that didn‚Äôt last long. His ex wife came out of the wood work and took our family to court trying to bleed us dry and take the land we had spent years developing. We had so much shit to pay for, lawyers, property bills, debts, and no money. Then there was the bitcoin. 

Nobody knew exactly how much he had, but we knew it was a lot. Nobody knew how to access it, we had read stories of people dying with bitcoin on Reddit and it just being nearly impossible to get access to. We were heartbroken and gave up trying to access it. The one thing that he had built over a decade for his family was gone. He had told me on multiple occasions that his bitcoin was his retirement plan for the entire family. He was the best of us. But we choked up another huge loss and did our best to carry on.

One day a few months after his death, we were going through the laptop bag he had left at his best friends house. In the side pocket we found his ledger. In the same bag‚Ä¶.was all of his seed codes. He was one of the smartest idiots I‚Äôve ever known. All that to say, we had gained access to his bitcoin, it wasn‚Äôt as much as we all thought, but it was still a lot. The relief we all had as a family understanding we had what we needed to financially recover was amazing. I received my unpaid salary from that bitcoin as my ‚Äúinheritance.‚Äù At this point I still didn‚Äôt really understand bitcoin and would‚Äôve rather just taken the cash. That sentiment became stronger when it crashed HARD in winter of 2021. Since then, I have been hodling with my dear life, mostly because I didn‚Äôt understand the market and didn‚Äôt know what to do, so I just didn‚Äôt touch it.

Suffice to say, our family was devastated during that crash once again. Besides selling what we absolutely needed to, everyone held. But this week, I can rejoice knowing that my parents, who never had anything more than 2k in their bank account because they decided to have 7 kids without careers, can retire. 

I remember one day, about a month or two before my brother died, I saw him in the morning and he had this big cheek to cheek smile. I was like ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs up why are you smiling so big‚Äù and he said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to buy mom and dad a house today.‚Äù He had gone to a police auction cash in hand, he ultimately got outbid, but that house he wanted to buy them might actually happen sooner than later. 

This was a long story, but I am feeling extra sentimental with all of these ATH‚Äôs, it makes me both feel like an idiot for not listening to my brother sooner, and an honor to be his sister who he was always looking out for. 

He‚Äôs the reason I get to sleep at night, not worrying so much for the first time in my life that I will be able to pay my rent. Shit, I might even be able to buy a house soon if things keep going the direction they are. Thanks brother.

Anyway, cheers to everyone else who is finally feeling the fruits of the hodl, it truly is an amazing feeling.",2024-11-13 13:13:05,1731525185.0

I was a working student which have been into Bitcoin since it was $3,000 only. I was depositing small amounts every now and then and would be withdrawing back then to make ends meet of my daily life.

I'm paying for my own tuition and everything since my parents don't have the capacity for it. I was also able to get into college due to Bitcoin when I was able to sell some when it hit $20k before. When my parents asked how I was able to get into college, I just told them I got a scholarship since they don't trust crypto. Also, I'm not an experienced trader, rather just a guy who likes the idea of Bitcoin and would buy the dip and sell during ATH.

Fast forward to a few months ago where I had to sell all my Bitcoin at $60k to pay my final tuition for college. If I didn't pay it, my 4 years of studying would go to nothing. I couldn't do that so I made the call to sell it.

I've graduated just a month ago, searching for jobs, but I had no Bitcoin left. I wanted to get a job as soon as I can to buy more Bitcoin but just couldn't. 

Now seeing it reaching $92k has made me full of regret while making me extremely depressed. Tons of what-ifs are running in my head, wondering if what I did was right. I can only tell myself that this is life. 
 
I can only give my thanks to Bitcoin for letting me survive with it alone. 

To all the guys who've been hodling since then, I hope you don't sell. 

To the moon you all go!

I contacted my financial advisor at the time and told them I wanted to cash it out and convert it to Bitcoin.

He told me he thought I was making a big mistake. I told him I had done my research, and I was willing to risk it all on what I believed to be true. He tried to talk me out of it one final time, then cashed me out and wished me the best.

At that time, I moved it all into Bitcoin. All my friends thought it was crazy. To be fair, I was down quite a bit for a long time because Bitcoin dropped over 50% after I bought it. I held strong though because I was firm in my conviction. I even continued to add to me stack as the years went by. Today I have nearly doubled my money from my initial IRA conversion purchase price and whole heartedly believe I will 10X it well before my retirement date.

Someone recommended Bitcoin years ago when it was at $13K.  Researched a little and tried to learn, but with work and all I eventually moved on. 

Now retired and watching the changes in the regulatory environment I felt the time was right.  Decided I‚Äôd purchase 10 BTC and ignore it for 10, maybe 20 years, and then split it amongst my 2 daughters.  

Started with 1 BTC (late Aug @ $58K), thinking the price was very high and hoped it would move down a bit and I‚Äôd buy 2 BTC at $50K and more if it went lower.  

Watched it move up and up.  Picked up another 1 BTC about 10 days ago @ $69K. Again, thought it was very high but I wanted to strengthen my position. 

We all know where we are today.  

I started an investment in AAPL 10-15 years ago.  Bought some here and there as the market went up and down.  After multiple splits, my average cost basis is ~$14.  Looking back, it‚Äôs kinda irrelevant if I bought at $14 or twice that at $28.  I‚Äôm starting to BELIEVE, as many have posted, that it is still early and 10 years from now buying today at $92K vs 2-1/2 months ago at $58k will be completely irrelevant.

705,For Those Who Doubt Crypto‚Äôs Value: Consider the Energy Behind 1 Bitcoin,9,1gqggvc,Bitcoin,https://i.redd.it/73vlx2l31p0e1.jpeg,4,"The energy required to produce one Bitcoin can vary widely depending on factors like mining hardware efficiency, electricity costs, and the current network difficulty. However, we can use average estimates to provide a general idea.

Current Energy Consumption Estimates:

	1.	Global Bitcoin Mining Energy Use:
	‚Ä¢	According to data from sources like the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index (CBECI), Bitcoin mining globally consumes about 120-150 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity annually.
	2.	Energy to Mine One Bitcoin:
	‚Ä¢	Approximately 900 Bitcoins are mined daily (as of 2024), and there are 365 days in a year:

\text{Total annual energy consumption} \div \text{Annual Bitcoin mined} = \text{Energy per Bitcoin}

Assuming global mining uses 150 TWh annually:

\frac{150 \, \text{TWh}}{900 \times 365} = 456 \, \text{MWh per Bitcoin}

One Bitcoin requires roughly 450-500 MWh (megawatt-hours) of electricity.

How Much Is That in Practical Terms?

To put 450-500 MWh into perspective:
	‚Ä¢	This is equivalent to the annual energy consumption of 15-20 average U.S. households.
	‚Ä¢	It‚Äôs also roughly the energy required to power an electric car for about 1.5 million miles.

Why Does It Take So Much Energy?

	1.	Proof of Work (PoW) Mechanism:
	‚Ä¢	Bitcoin mining involves solving complex cryptographic puzzles to validate transactions and secure the network.
	‚Ä¢	As the network grows, mining becomes more competitive, requiring more computational power.
	2.	Hardware and Electricity:
	‚Ä¢	Mining rigs (specialized hardware like ASICs) consume significant energy.
	‚Ä¢	In regions where mining is profitable, electricity is often sourced from fossil fuels or hydropower.

Future Trends

	‚Ä¢	Efficiency Improvements: Mining hardware is becoming more energy-efficient, which could lower the energy required per Bitcoin.
	‚Ä¢	Renewable Energy: Many miners are shifting to renewable energy sources, which could mitigate environmental concerns.

While Bitcoin mining is energy-intensive, its energy consumption is tied to the security and functionality of the network.",2024-11-13 10:12:13,1731514333.0

I would get distracted, and forget to water.

I could never pick the right days to plant or furrow.  And so I never got to harvest.

One day I found a seed.  Nobody around me recognized that it was a seed, but I did.

I examined it closely.  It was a seed I could grow!  A seed for me.  A special seed, fundamentally different from other seeds, but a seed none-the-less.

It seemed to me like it could grow forever, and I could live off its fruits.  I almost doubted my imagination.  I had to be careful.

I kept it close.  It didn't matter when I planted it.  It began to grow in the obscurity of my garden.

It didn't need my help.  I did nothing.  Like Siddhartha, I waited, I fasted, and I thought.

I waited long, never leaning on the sprout, barely looking at the rising shoot.

I didn't understand it fully.  I had no schemes to hasten its ascent.  I did not trust myself not to make a mistake.  I trusted myself that choosing not to act was best.  And I waited.

Some time later, my attentions and energies spent elsewhere, I returned to my garden and began living off the fruit.

I'm just average through and through in just about every aspect. Never really felt like he learns all that much from me. I'm pretty quiet normally, we sit in comfortable silences often. I inadvertently ended up taking my son to school today, he usually gets the bus.

What would have normally been a quiet drive turned into a 30 minute discussion about Bitcoin and stockmarkets etc. I don't even know how the conversation started, I think because they were talking about Musk on the radio. 

He's never show much interest before but he asked so many questions, like ""Who makes it go up?"" ""Why doesn't it just go up and up?"" ""What is the point of Bitcoin?"" ""Why can't billionaires get together and buy it""?

  
I got to explain about Bitcoin, buyers and sellers, how gold used to back the dollar and how maybe Bitcoin might do that in the future, inflation, all sorts of stuff. He loved it. Question after question and I hopefully opened his eyes just enough that he wants to explore it further.

  
Bitcoin hasn't just given me hope that there is an alternative, but for the first time I was able to talk to my son about something from a position of reasonably decent experience, he was hungry to learn more and maybe todays short conversation will be the start of something much greater that will facilitate a better life for him.",2024-11-13 08:14:02,1731507242.0

753,My Bitcoin experience so far...,314,1gqdmwr,Bitcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1gqdmwr/my_bitcoin_experience_so_far/,77,"I first heard about Bitcoin back in 2014. It sounded‚Ä¶ strange, like a fantasy currency for hackers or criminals. I couldn‚Äôt see what made it so special back then, so I just let it be. Fast forward to 2017, and suddenly, I‚Äôm seeing Bitcoin everywhere. It wasn‚Äôt just the news, but something about it finally clicked for me. This wasn‚Äôt just some fad, it was a new type of money, a kind that no one could mess with. A light bulb went off, and I decided I was going in.

In 2018, as the price took a nosedive, I bought my first Bitcoin. It wasn‚Äôt an easy time to get in. Imediately after my purchase the bitcoin price dropped alomst 70% from my buy in. The crypto market was crashing, and almost everyone I knew thought I‚Äôd lost my mind. My friends cracked jokes, my family made comments, and my girlfriend‚Ä¶ well, she thought I‚Äôd gone off the deep end. She used to say it‚Äôd be smarter to invest in ‚Äúreal stuff‚Äù like a house, or at least something I could hold in my hand.

But I wasn‚Äôt backing down. I was going all in. Over the next few years, I poured everything I could into Bitcoin and refused to sell even a single sat. HODL became my mantra, no matter what the market did. My girlfriend wasn‚Äôt a fan of that, either, and in 2023, she left me for someone else. It was one of those rock-bottom moments: I‚Äôd lost the relationship, nearly everything else, and even had to crash on a friend‚Äôs sofa for a while. I felt like I‚Äôd gambled and lost.

But I held on.

This morning, I checked my Bitcoin wallet, and there it was: $200,000. I couldn‚Äôt help but just stare at the screen, thinking about everything I‚Äôd gone through since that first buy. Looking back, every moment of ridicule, doubt, and sacrifice feels worth it. And the best part? I know I‚Äôm still just getting started.

I'm now in my early thirties, fit and single looking at my future with childlike wonder. ",2024-11-13 08:06:19,1731506779.0

There are about $100 trilllion of fiat currency in the world so if bitcoin were to become most of the currency in the world it would have to reach around $5 million per coin on a real basis.

There is about $1000 trillion of property in the world so bitcoin probably won't pass that and make it to $50 million per coin on a real basis.

At the higher price points we will probably be talking about the price of petroleum in bitcoin rather than the price of bitcoin in dollars.  At those points, most business will only accept bitcoin for payment.

Some years ago, I lost my job, broke up with my GF, and literally lived on a mattress in an empty new apartment. Though it was only a few days, it was incredibly symbolic, starting from 0 at almost 30 years old. I didn‚Äôt think much about it then, but looking back, I don‚Äôt want to live through that ever again.

Shortly after starting my new job, I decided to start learning more about investing, to start building wealth and the life I wanted. After dabbling in trading and starting with some index funds, I discovered Bitcoin and pretty soon switched my modest holdings over and started accumulating. Though I didn‚Äôt buy enough looking back (as everyone), I have a nice stack now to enjoy the bull market for my third time.

The reason I‚Äôm sharing this is because my Bitcoin journey is an incredible personal one, as it is for most people. Every bull run is a small reflection of how far I‚Äôve come, but more importantly, how far Bitcoin has come. Looking back, I‚Äôm pretty amazed at my conviction, since the general sentiment was so much different than today.

‚ÄúBitcoin can go to zero‚Äù was the widespread mantra; 6-figure, let alone 7-figure price targets, were laughable. No one would entertain the idea that any reputable institution would ever touch this. Fast forward to today, we are discussing when‚Äînot if‚Äîthe US will hold Bitcoin without being laughed out of the room, and major news stations present Bitcoin developments like the stock market.

My point here is, it‚Äôs easy to forget how incredibly far this has come and how clear it is where this is going. And while this was my thesis since my first buy, it‚Äôs so wild seeing this completely theoretical thesis play out so perfectly.



Cheers to where we are going.

Back in 2010 or so (a BitCoin was worth 10c each at the time) an online gaming friend sent me $10 worth of bitcoin that he had mined on the university computer in Malaysia. He sent it to me so that I would spend it on items for my character to help our gaming crew. It was like monopoly money back then. 

I laugh today, so that I don't cry, that I spent what is now over $8M playing a dumb social game. LoL. 

And I eventually bought another 100 bitcoin, but never used it all... My computer hard drive that contained the bitcoin crashed, I stopped playing the game, and that dead hard drive has simply sat in a box ever since. 

I am assuming that there is at least 20 bitcoin in that local bitcoin wallet on that dead hard drive. And I ""think"" I can actually figure out the password I used back then... I was in grad school at the ttime securing lots of confidential research documents and devised a ""pattern"" for keeping track of my many different passwords.  

There MUST be a way for me to eventually recover those bitcoin, right??? I mean, that dead hard drive likely has between $1 million and $2 million dollars worth of bitcoin locked away. I am just glad I shoved it in a storage box to hopefully someday recover the thesis research off of it. I didn't think twice about the bitcoin until recently with all of the press hype.

We are a poor country, yet no one cares about these economics.

Now, one of the quintessential thesis for btc is that holding BTC is a great hedge against the ever-increasing debasement of the US dollar.

And also, it‚Äôs very true that the Euro has been suffering a significant decline against the US dollar since ca 2008.

The uninitiated seem to think we say this because we all acknowledge that it's basically 50/50 that it'll moon or plummit to nothing. This is not the case. We don't believe that someday the world will wake up and realize that bitcoin was actually an elaborate scam like the buttcoiners claim.

Those who have been through a few cycles know deeply that as great as the current euphoria is, there will soon be a deep, painful, gut clenching fear that will hit us all when bitcoin rolls over that next ATH and then drops... and keeps dropping.. and doesn't stop.. until you feel like the amount you have now, compared to the ATH, is actually worthless. And that drop is why we say ""only buy what you can afford to lose."" Because if you can't afford to lose it you are going to sell somewhere on that drop as you perseverate on how many months of rent, food, diapers, gas, or formula that money could have bought. And then you'll sit pretty for a few months thinking at least you made the right choice and didn't lose everything. But then the next cycle will start and you will realize what a fool you were.

So.. only buy what you can afford to lose. So that you'll have the courage to hold on when you know you're about to lose it all... and in doing so not lose a thing.",2024-11-12 22:39:32,1731472772.0

792,First head about bitcoin in 2012. First invested in crypto in Jan 2018 - have made 14% TOTAL (not yearly). Don't be dumb like me.,15,1gq4bq9,Bitcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1gq4bq9/first_head_about_bitcoin_in_2012_first_invested/,9,"This is just a post for people just starting out or for entertainment value. I understand hindsight is 20/20 but if I had known what I had known in 2012 what I know now I would be a wealthy man. I'm sure many are the same here.

I first heard about Bitcoin in 2012 when an eccentric friend of my brother mentioned that people were mining the stuff with high powered computers and making decent money from it. The idea was dismissed as impractical due to living space, and I didn't have much money at the time to buy a mining rig anyway.

I never really thoguht or heard about BTC until 6 years later the 2018 crypto boom happened and I was 28, working full time and had spare money lying around. Many projects were starting up and making huge returns. That was when my journey of buying shitcoins and buying BTC high and selling it low began.

I invested into various crypto approx - 

\- $4000 in 2018

\- $500 in 2020

\- $60,000 in 2021

\- $28,000 in 2022

\- $9,000 in 2024

And sold at various times during those 6 years.

Even though my buy times were almost always peaks and sell times were troughs AND I lost huge amounts to shitcoins, in total I have invested approx $100,000 and made $111,000 before tax, rescued by BTC.

Even though my buy times were incredibly poorly timed if I had only bought BTC at those times and no shitcoins and held to today, I would have approx $225,000 in BTC. If I had believed in bitcoin and bought it on sale, I would be a millionaire.

Lesson 1 - believe in BTC. I think I'm preaching to the choir here but it seems certain that BTC is going from strength to strength now.

Lesson 2 - Dollar cost average - even though i bought huge chunks at peak times I still would have mad huge gains on BTC. If I had dollar cost averaged and bought low I would have made massive gains.

  
Lesson 3 - HODL, don't sell unless you hit some type of pre determined target.

Lesson 4 - Only invest what your not going to need within the next 5 years.

  
It's definitely crazy the price of 1 BTC now but I think it's only gonna go up in the future. In this digital age it has been around for long enough to be called ""proven"". ",2024-11-12 22:02:39,1731470559.0

Curious of your thoughts on this setup?,0,1gq3wzj,Bitcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1gq3wzj/selfcustody_feedback_curious_of_your_thoughts_on/,5,"I'm using a Coldcard Q.  Single signature setup.  I stamped my seed phrase into a metal backup plate.  I'm using a complex passphrase to store 99% of my coin with little on the regular seed phrase wallet.  This is as a decoy wallet.

At Location 1:  My Coldcard Q and my metal seed phrase.  Both stored securely and hidden.

At Location 2:  A MicroSD Card that has my complex passphrase saved on it.  With the cold card this method of saving it, encrypts the passphrase.  No one can copy and paste it from SD Card.  And can't access the encrypted passphrase unless they know my seed phrase.  It's a spot that has decent security but it could fall into someone else's hands, but also 99% chance won't happen and 99% chance they won't know what they're looking at.  And of course they can't get access to it without my seed phrase.

At Location 3:  Metal stamped backup of my complex passphrase.  Stored securely and hidden.

  
The idea is that if I need to move any coin I go and get the microsd card which isn't that hard to get access to.  I have to do that to move my coin.  I also have redundancy of my passphrase at two offsite locations.

One of the bigger reasons for doing this is it allows me to avoid a torture/$5 wrench attack.  But in a cheap and easy to use way.  I won't know my passphrase in this scenario.  I won't memorize it so I very much depend on location 2 and location 3 not being destroyed/lost at the same time.

Does anyone see any risks to this setup that I'm missing?  Besides the obvious of location 2 and 3 being lost/destroyed at the same time.  Or Location 1 being destroying metal seed plate backup.  Tornado or theft is about the only thing I can think of, but both seed plate and cold card are hidden very well.  Maybe I should do a SD Card backup of seed phrase at Location 2 or 3?

Bonus question:  Besides malware giving you a malicious receive address.  What are the other attack vectors from using a regular Apple computer to do your BTC transactions?  I use sparrow by the way....",2024-11-12 21:39:54,1731469194.0

I hope Bitcoin explodes to 200k but watching my 4 years stacking disappear very close to a massive bull run it makes me sad and stupid.

But I made 3.5x so I can't complain much.

Now this means one of 2 things. Either the retail rush is about to begin and we are going to see a huge amount of FOMO as we rocket past 100K OR we are in for a nasty sell off to scare all those same people away once again.

So I have been planning to take a trip to Europe with a group of buddies summer of 2025. Since I don't get paid vacation I always save the amount that I will miss in pay, to ""pay myself"" as if I were working. Plus what I want to have for spending, and all the other costs of travel. 

Instead of just setting this money aside for the trip in a savings account, I stared to DCA weekly into BTC expecting it to be worth more than i needed for the trip. I've already surpassed my savings goal and will only be increasing my weekly amount to continue purchasing. But now, I'm not sure I want to outright sell any of my BTC to cover my trip. But now I don't want to let any of it go!

Hi. I‚Äôm mid30s woman with some bitcoin and other coins.  I first heard of crypto in hs and didn‚Äôt have any money to invest but I believed in it. After a few solid years of working post college I started buying bitcoin bit by bit. Just whenever I had ‚Äòextra‚Äô funds. I also knew a friend who was gifted 5k for hs graduation and he put a large amount of that into coins. I think it was ‚Äò09 our grad year or the following year. 
Anyways, I bought in ‚Äò17 as you can see. I also believe I had some more before then but not sure of the platform etc so that‚Äôs lost. Between ‚Äò17 and ‚Äò21 I forgot about it. as 2020 was really difficult mentally for a number of reason, between ‚Äò21 and‚Äô24 I did nothing with it.. I moved from my home country to play sport professionally abroad and go to school in that time. I‚Äôve had little to no income and in ‚Äò24 I said eff it and bought some more. I did sell $200 in that same year to pay a bill I had back home (all my stuff is in storage)

Essentially, I‚Äôm still struggling, not playing at the moment and can‚Äôt legally work where I am - my current partner has been supporting us both as I DIY the home. My bills and cc are now all maxed. 

Should I sell a bit at this time in order to pay my storage bill again which is now about to go to auction? I owe 900$ and have $200 in BTC plus the last of my savings. 

Just pretty bummed out. I know most ppl will say HODL but idk what to do. I‚Äôm mentally, emotionally, and damn near physically drained.

Vanishes in a puff of digital smoke! And then where are you? Penniless! Destitute! Living in a cardboard box and eating ramen noodles for the rest of your life!
Okay, okay, maybe that's a bit dramatic. But seriously, think about it. Exchanges are a juicy target. They're like a giant honey pot just begging to be cracked open. And when they are, guess who loses out? You! Your precious Bitcoin, gone! Stolen! And you're left with nothing but a screenshot of your account balance and a whole lot of regret.
But wait, there's more! What if the exchange goes belly up? Remember Mt. Gox? Yeah, not a pretty sight. Millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin just... disappeared. And the people who had their coins on the exchange? Well, let's just say they weren't laughing.
So, what's the solution? Get your Bitcoin off the exchange! Move it to a secure wallet where you control the keys. It's like having your own personal Fort Knox for your digital gold. Sure, it might seem a little scary at first, but trust me, it's worth it. You'll sleep better at night knowing that your Bitcoin is safe and sound.

855,Future of Bitcoin,0,1gpu47e,Bitcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1gpu47e/future_of_bitcoin/,30,"On the eve of Trump's election, I had a gut feeling that buying some Bitcoin was a good idea. It turns out that my investment has returned me around 25% in a single week. If I had invested 10000 dollars, I would have earned 2500 dollars in a week from nothing. But due to my caution and being a first-time investor, I only spent 100 for a return of 125. This left me salivating, to put it crudely, but I'm smart enough to realise that it's probably a trap to put all my money into it now.

I had never had contact with Bitcoin prior to this. I have watched some videos by now and I understand the basics. Looking back at its history, it seems that Bitcoin never goes down permanently and it always comes back with a substantial net gain after each drop, so this makes me very tempted to put more money into it next time. For example, on the eve of Trump taking power.

But then my rational side kicks in. It was very obvious that Trump would cause Bitcoin to increase, so why didn't everyone spend all their money on it right then and there? I know that money never comes easily and freely. If the opportunity is too obvious that everyone can take it, it must lose value, right?

To formulate a more coherent question, let me ask you the following:

What are the risks of investing in Bitcoin before major world events that I know will increase its value? Why don't more people do the same? What is the trap that I'm failing to see? And why is it a dumb idea to spend all my money on Bitcoin if it always increases in value by a lot every year? How to correctly predict when is the right time to invest?

.

In summary, I get the strong feeling that Bitcoin is one of those things that are too good to be true. I mean, it can't be so easy to make 25% profit with an investment in just a week. Right?? Sorry I'm noob, I'm just scared.",2024-11-12 14:09:22,1731442162.0

Are there any good profit taking strategies? I have done some math and if (when?)

Now that its relatively easy to buy and sell BTC.  

Here's a hypothesis that has been flying around in my head

If you put your entire savings into Bitcoin or let's say 25% -50%  and you want to put in more to use it as a bank account that you can touch for the odd purchase ( holidays etc) it would be better than fiat because it holds it's value ? 

It's probably maximalism. Right ? 

Everything except your usual living expenses plus a little bit extra goes into it 

And if you need money you sell it ?  Or is it better to balance it ? 

Half fiat half bitcoin ?  For your surplus funds ? 

Taxes obviously play a part in this but since governments have declared war on their people with COVID jabs ( see the article on the ditch politician admitting they took orders from NATO)

It's fine to not comply ? ",2024-11-12 11:42:49,1731433369.0

Now, you can donate BTC directly through a Donor-Advised Fund (DAF), which is like a charitable investment account where you contribute assets (like Bitcoin), get an immediate tax deduction, and recommend grants to your favorite charities over time. UI Charitable has partnered with Unchained, allowing you to contribute, store, and donate Bitcoin‚Äîall without converting to fiat. Your BTC is held securely in a multisig vault (you hold a key, but can only send to charitable orgs), and you avoid capital gains tax while getting a full fair-market value deduction. DAFs are widely used by high-net-worth individuals, but I‚Äôm surprised they aren‚Äôt more common in the crypto community.

Here‚Äôs a bit more from Unchained: [unchained.com/donor-advised-funds](https://unchained.com/donor-advised-funds).

The answer is to always keep buying as much as you can reasonably afford. Set up a recurring buy every week / 2 weeks / month and don't touch it. Any price you buy at is lower than the price will eventually be. If you have some extra cash when the price starts falling (-5k, -15k, -20k, whatever), then make a lump purchase. But don't worry about buying at the exact bottom - the price will eventually come back up to way higher regardless. Just pay attention and buy extra when it's on the way down if you happen to have some disposable income at the time.

When I first started buying, I put in an automatic $27 every two weeks because that's all I was comfortable with / could afford. As my income has increased and I've gotten better at budgeting, that has grown to $250 every two weeks. I don't think about it anymore. It's just another bill I pay out of every paycheck. When I see a big dip, if I happen to have some extra cash saved, I do an additional buy for whatever I'm comfortable with. 

Just do something like this forever. Treat it like you would a Roth IRA. Set it and forget it. When you get ready to retire, start pulling money out a little at a time (or probably just use Bitcoin to pay for shit by then).",2024-11-12 10:30:07,1731429007.0

I'm having all manner of issues trying to find a portfolio tracker that will simply give me a profit/loss figure for crypto (primarily BTC) which I buy dollar cost averaging and then move to an external non-custodial wallet every now and then. 

So far I've tried CoinStats and Coin Ledger and they are both utterly useless at giving an accurate and correct figure for profit/loss across almost all of my investments. The figure it comes up with is out by sometimes tens of thousands $'s. 

My questions are:

* Is there a commonly agreed upon 'best' portfolio tracker out there which just simply works?
* Does anyone follow a similar method of investing using DCA and use a portfolio tracker successfully?
* Is this method of regular DCA'ing and then moving the BTC into an external non-custodial wallet just not very compatible with crypto trackers?

Hopefully someone can help me out!

In a completely hypothetical situation, let‚Äôs say the user has several trading accounts set up on different exchanges, has both hot and cold wallets, and is comfortable with buying/selling/storing in general. But the amount user has on the exchanges is significant to them, assume millions of dollars (I said HYPOTHETICALLY!) 

From a risk perspective, how would you advise their holding when they have already lost funds in self-custody due to a data breach on a tracking site? There was zero recourse or ability to stop the theft even as it was happening. Police and FBI are useless, aside from filing the report to avoid taxes on the stolen funds. 

At least the exchanges have high security practices and fraud mitigation, and you can work with them from an insurance and legal perspective. 

On the other hand, if they decide to cut you off or are somehow compromised by the government (Choke Point style,) then it would be much better to have your own custody. But what do you do if something in your self-custody fails? There is nobody to blame but yourself, and zero way to recover your funds.

But remember, unless you truly understand bitcoin, you will sell it off early as you're still thinking about money in terms of fiat instead of bitcoin, which is the future of money and there is no second best.

A great way to dive deeper into bitcoin is setting up a node!  There is lot of information linked here, learn about bitcoin first at [hope.com](http://hope.com) and then when you feel ready, go to [bitcoin.org](http://bitcoin.org) and learn how to run an actual node so you can be part of the community validating blocks.  Become a part of the actual network and be a part of the future!  You can do this!

932,Bitcoin 2033,0,1gpklkp,Bitcoin,https://i.redd.it/hnxlhyiy1h0e1.jpeg,3,"In the year 2300, the world had become a landscape shaped by advanced technologies, bio-engineered cities, and omnipresent surveillance. At the top of this new world order stood the BTC Global Corporation, a titan that had outgrown every other institution. Known by most as ‚Äúthe Bitcoin Corp,‚Äù it wielded more power than any government, more wealth than any nation, and more control than any empire. Bitcoin had once been a currency for the people, decentralized and free, but now BTC Global controlled it all. And in its iron grip was the Saylor Division, a covert group tasked with enforcing the corporation‚Äôs absolute control.

The Saylors were relentless, a shadow force that operated out of sight, rooting out any trace of independence from BTC Global‚Äôs reach. Their primary directive was clear: eliminate anyone who held one of the few remaining original Bitcoin private keys.

Years ago, BTC Global had convinced the world to turn over control of their wallets in exchange for seamless transactions, secure storage, and unimaginable wealth ‚Äì for those who complied. Private keys became relics, their use outlawed, their holders branded as fugitives. But rumors persisted that a handful of people still held their private keys, clinging to the last remnants of the freedom Bitcoin had once symbolized. These few renegades represented a threat that BTC Global could not ignore. And so, Saylor was unleashed.

Their target today was an old man named Elias, one of the last known holders of an original Bitcoin private key. Elias had lived a quiet life off the grid, hiding from the relentless advances of BTC Global. He had once been a celebrated cryptographer, a revolutionary who had championed Bitcoin‚Äôs rise before the corporation‚Äôs takeover. Now, he was the hunted.

The Saylor unit assigned to Elias was led by Agent Marcus Tane, a hard-edged veteran with a reputation for success. Tane was methodical, precise, and devoid of mercy. To him, these relics of the past were traitors to the new order. Tane saw the world as a place that required control and order, and those who resisted it were enemies.

Elias, however, knew they were coming. He had kept his private key hidden, not in some digital safe but in his mind. He had memorized it, the final act of resistance he could muster against a world that had turned against him. As he fled through the dense, neon-lit alleyways of the underground city, he clutched a small device that contained the only remaining part of his life‚Äôs work: a memory chip with encoded knowledge on the original blockchain, unsullied by BTC Global‚Äôs countless revisions.

The streets were eerily silent, punctuated only by the hum of drones patrolling the skies above. Elias had spent years preparing for this, but the weight of age was bearing down on him. He could hear the distant hum of Saylors approaching, their mechanical suits amplifying their every movement, their augmented bodies giving them strength and speed that no ordinary human could match.

He ducked into a hidden alley, breathing heavily. He had to make it to the data center, where a handful of loyalists still maintained an ancient network of decentralized nodes ‚Äì the last fragments of the old blockchain. He knew if he could just reach them, there was a chance to upload his key and set off a chain reaction that would unlock the truth BTC Global had buried.

But the Saylors were close. Agent Tane moved like a phantom, scanning every dark corner, every shadow. His visor flickered with data as he analyzed the area, seeking any anomaly, any sign of life. His team spread out, forming a perimeter that closed tighter by the second.

Just as Elias reached the data center‚Äôs hidden entrance, a beam of red light scanned across his face. He froze, and time seemed to stand still as he heard the metallic voice of Agent Tane behind him.

‚ÄúElias Kade. You‚Äôre in violation of BTC Global‚Äôs Encryption Law 709. Drop the device and surrender.‚Äù

Elias turned slowly, eyes filled with a defiant fire that hadn‚Äôt dimmed over decades. ‚ÄúYou can control the world, Tane, but you can‚Äôt control freedom. Not truly. As long as even one key exists, people will remember.‚Äù

Agent Tane‚Äôs face was emotionless beneath his visor. ‚ÄúYour defiance is meaningless. There is no freedom outside BTC Global.‚Äù

Elias closed his eyes, pressing a hidden button on the device. A faint hum began to emit from it, a pulse that echoed through the forgotten servers behind him. In that instant, he knew he wouldn‚Äôt live to see the change, but he had planted a seed ‚Äì the last code, the final key, sent across the last open nodes of the old network.

Tane‚Äôs expression flickered as his visor picked up on the anomaly, and he raised his weapon. But it was too late. Elias had already let go, releasing himself from the shackles of the present, knowing he‚Äôd done his part to revive the past.

As the pulse spread, disrupting BTC Global‚Äôs control for a moment, a new signal began to blink on terminals across the world. It was small, barely noticeable, but it was there. The last bastion of freedom, ignited by one man‚Äôs defiance, now whispered across the network, waiting for those willing to listen.",2024-11-12 07:22:48,1731417768.0

*Introduction*

September 12, 1962, Rice University, Houston, Texas

""...We meet at a college noted for knowledge, in a city noted for progress, in a state noted for strength, and we stand in need of all three, for we meet in an hour of change and challenge, in a decade of hope and fear..."".

*The Challenge*

""...We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard. Because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one we intend to win..."".

*Rationale*

""...Space is there, and we're going to climb it, and the moon is there, and we're going to fly to it... And we're going to keep going, and we're going to keep pushing... for the new frontiers of the American spirit..."".

*Context and Purpose*

Kennedy emphasized:

1. *Space exploration*: Demonstrating America's technological prowess.
2. *National security*: Ensuring US leadership.
3. *Inspiration*: Capturing imagination, motivating innovation.
4. *Human progress*: Advancing scientific knowledge.

*Conclusion*

""...Let us not be afraid of our dreams. This is a new ocean, and I believe the United States must sail on it... We will succeed.""

*Key Statistics*

1. *Duration*: 17-minute speech
2. *Attendance*: 40,000+
3. *Objective*: Mobilize support for NASA's Apollo program

*Legacy*

Kennedy's speech galvanized public support, accelerating NASA's moon landing efforts. Apollo 11 achieved this goal July 20, 1969.

So, in resume, Bitcoin is going to the moon

This started almost 18 years ago. I was young, and my family wasn‚Äôt really stable. At that time, my mom was very hard on me financially (I was in 5th grade). Since then, I became financially aware and started studying finances and markets. Fast forward a few years, I stumbled upon my first contact with Bitcoin, but it was very early, and I didn‚Äôt know better.

Fast forward 2 years, I encountered Bitcoin again and became really interested in it. I read everything that came my way and did lots of math and forward projections. I also started talking about it to friends and relatives. I‚Äôm currently shaking telling this story because they made me afraid, and that fear stays with me to this day. I knew better; I really did, but I didn‚Äôt trust myself. I knew 1 million was the goal, the easy goal. I did the math, and it was easy to see that with less than 5% of the world‚Äôs economic supply, we could reach 1 million. Man, I was afraid and young. I did my first buy‚Äîjust a couple of coins. It was like 2% of my whole net worth at the time. I believed, but I was also afraid. I had the opportunity to buy plenty, and I didn‚Äôt. I was afraid of my mom and dad finding out I spent all my money on some ‚Äúinternet nonsense.‚Äù

Man, I regret my lack of confidence in Satoshi‚Äôs vision. I‚Äôve been holding since the 30 usd ATH and the consequent drop. I‚Äôve been riding this rollercoaster really early, and I have felt really alone on this trip‚Äîtoo many ups and downs to count, too many nights looking at graphs and feeling bad and good.

977,What is your biggest regret in bitcoin?,0,1gpgkme,Bitcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1gpgkme/what_is_your_biggest_regret_in_bitcoin/,14,"Hello everyone!

First of all, congratz on 89k.

This is my first post in the btc community, i would like to share with you all my biggest regrets in bitcoin and the crypto world:

1 - not having enough of an open mind to buy bitcoin early

I first heard about bitcoin in back in 2015 - 2016, from one of my friends in uni and unfortunately for me my mentality back then was not investment oriented, but hey i guess everyone has to go through certain phases to reach or be where they are today.

2 - not managing my spending wise enough.

I think managing personal expenditures is not something easy for anyone, most people spend way more than they can afford let alone investing wisely.

Personally this has been one of biggest challenges, but it also taught me a lot, still to this day, i try to spend as least as possible because i know that in the near future that money will easily be a minimum of x2 - x4 if invested in btc, probably more if managed properly.

3 - not taking profit

Hodling for dear life isn‚Äôt necessarily a bad strategy, for most people this can actually be the best decision they ever made, but taking some profit while in price discovery mode is not a bad idea, after all bitcoin is cyclical.

Selling or at least DCA on the way up is a very safe play, that way if it does keep going up you would still have bitcoin, and if it goes down you could always buy more, a very simple idea but if applied properly, conservatively and wisely can make you wealthy, but also helps the market by stabilizing it. 

4 - over leveraging

Last but not least is leverage.

In 2022 i was foolish enough to have an over leveraged long position with no stop loss, which has been by far my biggest financial loss that ever occurred to me, but also taught me a big lesson.

That being said, i came back stronger this cycle, and hopefully this long pain and struggle i went through was actually all i ever needed, it has set me on the right path.

In short, don‚Äôt over leverage, or don‚Äôt leverage at all, unless you are a pro with tons of experience, don‚Äôt fool yourself into thinking you know how to use it, almost all beginners don‚Äôt

I managed to accumulate up to .43 BTC DCAing aggressively, but due to IRL situations I had to sell half of that last month.

Now with the pump I'm really excited to see how my remaining grows in value like crazy, but can't help to feel like shit because I don't know how long it will take me (or if I will be able) to get to where I was before.

I know there is no solution but to keep DCAing, that it will go up and down........but :'(",2024-11-12 02:42:21,1731400941.0

My question is: what minimum amount of BTC or satoshis should my transfers from the exchange to my cold storage have?

Right now, I‚Äôm planning to send every 0.01 BTC. Do you think this is fine and won‚Äôt cause any issues, or should I accumulate more on the exchange and send larger amounts?
