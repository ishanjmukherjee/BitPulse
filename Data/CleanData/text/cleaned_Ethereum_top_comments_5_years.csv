Use the money, talk to a tax person. You'll spend less than $1,000 to save yourself a bunch of time, effort, and money by using every advantage. You're also buying a bit of insurance. If you go through a certified tax person, and they fuck it up, THEY get in trouble, not you.

2: people that look at the #1 people with ""you silly folks"" face, knowing that ether is going to win.

Like, there was a booth demonstrating their service, which was actually a really good idea. It was a browser extension that you use on a checkout page, the total on the page was $11.97, so you load up the extension, punch in 11.97, and select a bitcoin account. The service creates a temporary debit card with a random number, takes the bitcoin from the account and let's you use the card number they made in the website.

I asked how it worked under the hood. Get this. It connects to coinbase and reduces your balance by however much $11.97 is. There are no actual transactions on the chain. It's very centralized, requires a lot of trust, both coinbase and their app, and just like... Why? You're not using bitcoin really, it's a hack, there's no blockchain at all being used here.

There was a lending platform, deposit BTC, get interest on it, but you can really borrow anything, it has KYC, they hold the keys while it's deposited, so they're not your coins. This platform was ALL THE RAVE. People were going nuts over it.

These poor folks have no clue what we're doing on eth.

These people are saying that bitcoin is the new gold, which i don't disagree with, it's great for a lower risk crypto, but you can't do anything with gold, which is partly why it's lower risk. So they say it's like gold, but then they treat it like automatable cash.",positive,0.86812466,37

This is false... (right?)

Ethereum is not a cryptocurrency.  Ethereum is a blockchain platform that provides smart contract capability.  Many solutions can be, and have been, developed and implemented on this platform—Ether (a cryptocurrency) is one those.  Other crypto currencies are also built on the Ethereum platform.

The reason Uber and eBay take fees is because they provide value, you would not have known about the items or services without said companies, or you would spend all your time looking for it and then negotiating a smart contract. 

Smart contracts are basically escrow with a third party intermediary that you program to release funds if xyz is met. Sadly though you often need a third party to do that.

732,2022-03-18,"What I'm seeing is the community ignoring the speculative nature of crypto in an unregulated market. Meaning the vast majority of people are investing in this tech not as a means of propagating this tech but I the hopes it's worth more in the future and therefore can be sold for profit. Couple that with little to no regulations and you get the stock market but one where the big players can be even more corrupt with their fortunes. I believe that's where Warren and most of the Democrats are coming from, if they have a policy in mind at all (which I haven't seen much more than Warren + buzz from the right). 

I think the right wing media system is taking crypto as a selling point because it's... Well it's another poorly regulated stock market the oligarchs are making a ton of money off of. And saying that in crypto subs feels like holding up a ""stone me at will"" sign because at the end of the day I think whatever movement there was to crypto has been lost to commerical traders by and large. And I think people, even well meaning people who believe in the tech, have been swallowed up by this. 

I hate people saying both parties are the same and that it's all meant to divide you. There are problems on both sides but they differ in quality and quantity vastly.

734,2022-03-18,"This has been my fear for years.

Maxi’s are extremely libertarian, and as a result those beliefs are likely to hurt crypto as a whole as their bad beliefs are now an ingrained part of crypto’s popular beliefs, such as deflation being universally good for a currency or the belief that a newer banking system should not be built on top of crypto to deal with its shortcomings as eventually we will need to ability to stop or reverse payments on some layer or even for a bank to be able to share ownership of keys or something yet to be invented in order to help protect less technically capable users.

The harsh reality is that crypto is not currently accessible for most users, and locking out more people from the future financial system is far worse than what we have now, and any extra, and unnecessary difficulty that hinders usability is going to have catastrophic ramifications for poorer people, far worse than the inequality present now. There’s a reason people don’t hide money in their walls, and we do actually need a solution that is usable by everyone as the current methods, such as splitting keys or the current implementation of hardware wallets are not exactly user friendly.

This “pull your bootstraps up” ideology is crypto’s cancer, and it must be excised. The “users can figure it out” is crypto’s weight problem, you can’t just tell people to eat healthier, and expect it to work. If we are so smart then we need to develop systems, tools, and more to ease the learning curve of crypto before it’s too late for poorer, and less educated or technically capable people to invest during a meaningful stage of its inception.

Political beliefs, as well as intellectualism are affecting design decisions, and the way in which people advocate for crypto such as the anti-government nonsense or lack of understanding in the utility that financial institutions do provide are not good for long term success, and adoption or for poorer people, which it’s supposed to help.

737,2022-03-18,"I think a lot of what Vitalik is concerned about is because BTC has become somewhat right-leaning in nature. As it rises in popularity the technocrats continue to peddle it to the global finance sector. It appeals to modern day technological gold-bugs, private property enthusiasts, and those subscribing to the maxi narrative that all things should be unchanging. The space for crypto to move left is where things are to be built on environments that allow for building and innovation that can benefit all instead of just individuals, and well-funded venture capital.
 
From the US lens, I see two problems in particularly, firstly older politicians who don't understand technology in general, and secondly those just trying to let greed run rampant. I think a lot of ""right-wing"" politicians see crypto for the scam/shill parts of it that fits in so well with what they're used to doing.

Ultimately crypto and blockchains are simply a tool to be used by anyone. I think there's great opportunity for Web3 achieve and solve problems related to owning your personal data.

You could make an equally valid post about the issues facing, or plaguing depending on your point of view, Ethereum.

A more honest, and less biased post would mention how keeping the ""stolen funds"" intact is simply refusing to bail out those who lost money. It's terrible that it happened but, that's a consequence that people need to become comfortable with potentially occurring, along with irreversible transfers to wrong addresses, being lost in exchanges should they go under or rug pull, etc. It's ironic how so many who complain about bailouts being handed to giant corporations have no issue with bailouts when it personally benefits them. Properly ensuring a smart contract is ""correct"", and incapable of being exploited is extremely important, and this demonstrated why to both developers, and users. Did it suck? Yes. Did it hurt people? Yes. Should it had been undone? Personally, no. There is no point in claiming that smart contracts are law, and can't be changed once they are agreed upon if once something goes wrong then they are reverted. The fork defeated the purpose of a blockchain, and, hopefully, it demonstrated how important it is to be correct, to test, to read, and to trust only when necessary for all parties involved.

The community decided that ETH is the ""correct"" chain, true, that is why ETC became a different community. I'm not sure what this claim is trying to suggest other than ""it's not us so it's bad"" which is both childish, and immature.

Developers exist for every current blockchain. Is validity based only on the size of a development team? Once upon a time, PHP was widely used, however, that does not mean that it was the best for that relevant timeframe nor does it mean that Python was bad by comparison. I'm not suggesting that ETC is better or worse, I'm only stating that this point is, in fact, pointless.

ETH is secure precisely because it is POW with a massive hardware investment securing it, which it will soon lose. I'm not suggesting that it will be very insecure, I am only suggesting that it will be slightly less secure from a technical point of view. This isn't disputed as it is a widely known fact.

Your suggestion that ETC is insecure because its current difficulty is low could have therefore been equally applied to ETH years ago, and even currently if a monied interest or nation-state was so inclined, though not as easy as attacking a POS system.

ETCs difficulty can be easily solved which I'm sure you are aware of, and once ETH goes POS it will face a new set of potential attacks that ETC and ETH, and other POW systems currently do not face, yet you failed to mention that for some reason. Many benefits that POS provides could also be provided via layers, this is irrelevant as well.

A lot of this post boils down to ""it's not ETH"", which I'm sorry to inform you isn't an argument.

Just because both ETC, and ETH are different doesn't mean one is dead, less secure, or, simply put, worse.

Maybe people are investing in it now in advance precisely because ETH is going POS, maybe they trust it less, maybe they do not trust the team to manage such a feat in a timely manner or at all, maybe they prefer POW, or maybe they foresee miners transferring the majority of their hash power to ETC rather than other cryptos. We do not know, exactly, why ETC is climbing so hard but, this post is disappointing, and depressing pushing a narrative that is full of FUD.

I can understand posting a ""DOGE is dead, fucked up, not funny, and burning your money"" type of post but, doing that in reference to ETC? I don't understand the point.

For those that may not know, ""Txstreet is a live cryptocurrency transaction visualizer featuring Bitcoin, Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash.""

""When a new transaction is broadcasted to a cryptocurrency, a person appears and attempts to board a bus. If the transaction has a high enough fee, they will board the first bus and be ready to be included in the next mined block. If there are too many transactions to be included in the next block, and the transaction didn't pay a high enough fee, the person will either wait in line or board a different bus.""

* Buy USDC and bridge to Polygon, Harmony, or Fantom with Celer Cbridge (costs about .1% to bridge, so pretty good). On Fantom you can supply ETH on Tarot for 7-11% APR (though it fluctuates)

Of course it's worth noting that there are risks to any smart contract protocol; a lot of the people here would probably recommend sticking with ETH network due to the networks security.

1320,2022-02-06,"The limits on making block time faster have to do with safety and decentralization (specifically, avoiding scenarios where nodes with much better network connections have a large economic advantage, which risks leading to ethereum mining or staking centralizing on eg. AWS).

In **proof of work**, the core problem is that blocks come at random times; if the average block time is 13s, that means that there is a 1/13 chance that the next  two blocks will come within 1 second of each other. When two blocks appear that close together, the miner with a better network connection has an advantage in propagating their blocks first, and so could beat out the second. This effect is tolerable with 13s block times, especially with [uncle rewards](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/uncle-block-cryptocurrency.asp) reducing the economic penalty of having your block appear slightly too late. But it becomes a huge problem with eg. 3s block times.

In **proof of stake**, blocks arrive evenly once per 12 sec, so that problem does not exist. However, another problem appears. Our version of proof of stake attempts to give blocks a very high level of confirmation after even one slot, and this requires thousands of signatures (currently ~9100) per slot to get included in the next slot. This process incurs latency and takes time. The time is more like logarithmic than linear (so, cutting the slot time in half and doing ~4550 signatures per slot would not work, as each now-shorter slot would still take _almost_ as long), but aggregating that many signatures is still a big deal and requires multiple rounds of network communication. This process probably _could_ be done safely in 6s or even a bit less, but the problem is that at that point quite a few signatures would not get included on-chain on time, and the rewards would once again start to really favor highly centralized actors. The current ~12s is conservative and gives us a good buffer against such risks.

I don't expect the per-slot time to be reduced much in the future. Though what is looking more and more likely is [single-slot finality](https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/single_slot_finality), which will mean that a single slot would actually finalize a transaction instead of just strongly confirming it as it does today. Applications that need really fast confirmations would have to rely on either channels or rollups with sequencers providing pre-confirmations. That said, we are also actively researching in-protocol mechanisms that could give users reasonably strong assurance after only a few seconds that some transaction will get included in either the next or another near-future block.",positive,0.7637307,514

Ok this makes things much clearer. It seems that it ultimately boils down to ensuring that validators with slower connections can still attest and receive rewards. And as others already mentioned, ensuring that nodes wouldn't need higher storage requirements.

I'm still curious about the 12s figure because from a layman's perspective it seems kind of long given that blocks are only 80KB, and thus would sound like something that could be done closer to 6 seconds like you said (I'd guess a couple seconds to receive the block, a couple seconds to validate, a couple seconds to send it off). On another note, I wonder how long it takes to propagate a 80KB block to the 2/3 of validators required to validate a block.

We all know that there are other alt-l1s with significantly faster block times. When they talk about their faster transaction times and lower gas fees, the standard response is ""well they sacrifice decentralization"". Which is true, but it would be more constructive to be able to explain/quantify what exactly the tradeoffs are, and how 12s was determined to be the optimal block time.

It seems that consensus mechanism influences the possible speed, but speed is ultimately set politically by the protocol which is being [increased to 12s](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/11/29/how-the-merge-impacts-app-layer/). Every answer to a ""why don't we just reduce block times"" post I've seen always talks about ""orphan rates"", which are entirely eliminated by Proof of Stake. Thus it would seem to me that Proof of Stake enables faster block times than Proof of Work. But since ethereum decided that block times should be 12 seconds, we keep it at 12 seconds. Would like to see resources discussing the tradeoffs of faster block times under proof of stake.",positive,0.9081393,11
1346,2022-02-06,"To clarify a bit on this point, the current Proof of Work algorithm could easily be tweaked to cut block times in half. In fact it changes difficulty automatically to maintain the current Poisson distribution of about 13 seconds per block, based on the hash rate of the network.

We could also double block sizes and double throughput that way.

The issue is what is called ""state bloat"", every node has to keep each block, and if you double the amount of data that needs to be kept, it begins to reach a point that small node operators can't afford the hardware or bandwidth to handle it.

This increases the barrier to entry for node operators, and leads to a less decentralized, and thus less secure, network.

There are efforts to implement state pruning, or allowing nodes to discard historical data, and that will potentially allow larger blocks or more frequent blocks, although there are still bandwidth concerns there.",positive,0.50006896,19
1347,2022-02-06,"Ok I'll elaborate more on my explanation:

Under Proof of Work, block time (correct me if I'm wrong) is basically just a function of the mining difficulty. Reduce the mining difficulty, and you've reduced the block times. The problem is that if you reduce the mining difficulty / block times too much, then eventually the network latency starts to result in more blocks simultaneously being mined before they can be fully propagated to the others. This means more forking and having to reconcile these forks (higher orphan rate), which is all wasted time since forks are just thrown away.

However, Proof of State totally eliminates the ""mining difficulty"" part of the equation, replacing it with a simple random validator assignment. Instead of every validator simultaneously racing to solve the mining puzzle, only one validator creates a block at a time, and the rest validate the legitimacy of that block (attestation).

Intuitively, it would follow that block times could be drastically reduced under Proof of Stake, since now the only lower bound is the network latency and there's no dealing with fork reconciliations. Validators don't have to waste time on hashing puzzles, they simply create a new block when told, and validate other blocks when not.

I wasn't able to find any metrics on the time it takes an ethereum block to propagate to the rest of the network, but it's hard for me to imagine that being more than a few seconds for 50% of the network since block sizes are only \~80kb. If this number were say 3 seconds, it would seem that Proof of Stake should be able to take block times closer to that.

Again I imagine my mental model of how this all works is totally incorrect. Would love for someone to point out the errors in my assumptions + reasoning (even better if accompanied with numbers)",positive,0.7841962,1

Point 2) is pretty obvious - a new version of MTGO.

Point 1) may not be so obvious to those unfamiliar with the art and collectibles (sneakers, cards, sports memorabilia, etc.) world. There is a reason people like Steve Cohen own and operate companies which value collectibles or fine art.

<rant>

In the old days, let's say you want to launder $50 Million. 

Good: you buy real estate with the cash, settle it, then sell again to your clearing house. That's pretty public, though. 

Better: you buy a piece of rare fine art, anonymously via an auction house like Sotheby's. Then you sell it later, anonymously. 

Best: You fake the art, then value it 'independently', then buy it anonymously via Sotheby's, then sell it later, anonymously.

But faking art is very hard. Also, being your own validator can be tricky.

So. What's better than best? CREATING art in a verifiable way. NFT. 

Even bestest-er: you don't need Sotheby's anymore. Just exchange the token a few times, and boom - market value established.

Now, not only have you been able to create instant fine art on the block chain, you've sloshed it around a bit and there is clear, verifiable evidence that people are willing to pay millions for this particular crypto kitty or whatever.

So, now you can go get a loan, using this NFT as collateral. Neat! Now buy more DOGE/BTC/ETH and stake it for gainz.

Even better! You get multiple loans, using this same NFT as collateral, but probably don't tell the banks, DeFi counterparties, etc., that you have done this (this is asset rehypothecation).

Now, you started with $1M in FIAT dollary-do's. You bought much ETH. You minted an NFT. You passed the NFT around (wash sales). You got some loans (misrepresentation of assets). Now you've been able to stake maybe $10M in crypto at 5% APY. Neat.

But if you're a crafty financier with no morals, why stop there? *goofy-ill-fkn-do-it-again.jpg*

Mint 10 more NFTs instead of staking. Now you have $100M in crypto from loans with $1M FIAT to start.

WTF are these degens doing !? The secret ingredient, as always, is crime. 

NFT's are not good or bad, they're just tools. They enable great stuff like resale of used games which kick a portion of the proceeds to the game authors. They also make it easier to run some tried-and-true criminal plays, though.

So I guess we'll see if regulators try to clamp down on NFT's somehow. If they do, good f'n luck to them - this horse has left the barn.

1552,2021-10-19,"\#1 - Most NFT art is a lazy attempt at making easy money.

\#2 - I have heard that some people are selling other people's art as NFTs, without permission. For example, some random person could take the image above and sell it as an NFT. But buyer beware, because only the original image certified by the artist, would have any real value to an adept investor (if it has any value to an investor at all.) It's no different than art forgery, in that it can only fool those who are less educated on art.

\#3 - I think NFTs could be useful in identifying pirated pictures, audio recordings, etc.. But it would only  useful if the person who did the pirating can be identified and punished. But even then, if I use a song as an example, most people won't care if they have the original or a pirated version, as long as they can listen to the song. But we don't want to live in a world in which we would to have to provide KYC to purchase music, digital art, etc..

\#4 - If you had to provide an NFT as a form of identification to access certain online content, or to access a physical location such as a concert, that could be useful. For example, some people share their Netflix logins, so NFTs could possibly prevent this kind behaviour. It could also possibly be used instead of a physical ""ticket.""",positive,0.8175478,1

1697,2021-10-11,"There are two issues here: 
1. What kind of slippage are you trying to avoid here? 

Coinbase can probably handle 60 ETH orders (today's 24 hour volume is 120,000 eth for context) but there might be some slippage if the market is slow when you do it. Uniswap can also handle this volume, and it shows you estimated slippage before you perform the transaction. 


2. Selling/swapping crypto to stablecoins/fiat are taxable events. 

Trading it counts as a taxable event for you before you donate. It's better to donate the crypto itself without triggering a taxable event and go straight into the nonprofit tax advantaged side of money and do all the conversions/transfers inside the tax advantage. A blockchain nonprofit 501(c)(3) can accept your eth and track/report and send cash tax free to other 501c3 nonprofits. I would encourage you to execute a written contract or some other way to get assurance that they will donate/work collaborate with the charity of your choosing.

While I think that yes, someone who finds a great video should be rewarded a bit for their efforts, at the end of the day, that is someone else's content, and if we're now putting a value on its popularity (with karma coin), shouldn't some of those earnings be given back to the creator?  I hope Reddit has had these discussions, and not sure if there's an easy answer at this point – short of say needing to have that creator that made the video on TikTok also be on Reddit and then sharing the Karma coin with them. Eventually the road this leads down is having complete fluidity between platforms, so that any content from TikTok gets auto-attributed to the creator - who knows if that will ever happen, but pair this with BAT, and there are some very interesting things starting to brew for the creator economy.",positive,0.902233,2

Have you had a look at this conference paper? [Decentralizing the Stock Exchange using Blockchain An Ethereum-based implementation of the Bucharest Stock Exchange](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8516610)

&#x200B;

**Abstract:**

>This paper tackles the  shortcomings of the traditional centralized stock exchange systems, such  as high transaction fees, centralized governance susceptible to attacks  and lack of openness regarding the market actions and algorithms, by  proposing an innovative architecture using blockchain to develop a  decentralized stock exchange and an open continuous market. The proposed  blockchain based solution solves the drawbacks of the centralized stock  exchange architecture by ensuring the integrity and security of the  owner's assets and orders, self-enforcing smart agreements between  parties as well as achieving democratic and reliable decisions regarding  the execution and settlement of the orders through consensus  algorithms. The proposed architecture uses smart contracts to enforce  the validation of the owner's rights and the correct execution and  settlement of the orders, thus eliminating the need of a central  authority that ensures the correctness of the stock exchange process.  The solution was validated by implementing a prototype in Ethereum for a  subset of rules for the Bucharest Stock Exchange. The experimental  results show that the decentralized solution can offer lower transaction  fees by replacing the commissions owed to brokers and central  authorities with mining fees that are used to compensate the miners for  their honest work in keeping the integrity of the system.

&#x200B;

**Conclusions:**

>In this paper, we propose a decentralized solution for the BVB Stock  Exchange Market to overcome the drawbacks of the centralized  architecture and reduce the transaction fees due to the brokers and  central authorities. We integrate the stock market elements in a  blockchain architecture together with associated smart contracts that  ensure self enforcement of the published orders.  
>  
>A prototype was  implemented in Ethereum to validate and test the proposed architecture.  The results are promising showing that for partially filled order books,  the blockchain based solution has a clear advantage of providing lower  fees. Furthermore, for filled order books, the decentralized approach  gives better results than the centralized approach only for orders more  expensive than 2500 dollars, where the mining fees become smaller than  the broker fees. However, for a high-profile client that trades tens of  thousands of dollars, the blockchain-based architecture requires far  less fees than traditional stock exchanges.

1) Is it too costly/hard to stake from a cold wallet? Or is it easier/less costly to stake through a platform like Binance? I've only started this crypto journey, so I don't think I have enough ETH to make staking solo worthwhile. 

2) I assume though if it's staking from a cold wallet, it assumes it's only possible through decentralized apps (dapps)?

3) I also assume it'll be costly to transfer from Binance (hot wallet) to a cold wallet if it's just a small amount of ETH?

I understand the main point of crypto is really decentralization. But I feel I need to take the baby steps moving from centralized exchanges (like Binance), then later on transfer to cold wallet and transacting through dapps.

Have you considered that Ethereum is dead? The founder hasn't said so directly, but creating a version 2 of anything without drawing inspiration from the original shouldn't be considered an upgrade... 

It's scrapping the previous project entirely with omission of its shortcomings. It's eagerly attempting to masquerade the truth and avoid losing face. It's convincing an entire community of investors to gamble their money on new and untested technology. It's the hypocrisy of having spent years mocking 3rd gen blockchains only to make a complete 180 and start copying them. It's wanting to take credit for other people's ideas...like when Vitalik was first on Lex Fridman's podcast and he took credit for having come up with DAOs... Which was Dan Larimer.

The eth foundation has already established a willingness to rollback transactions (they did so because they had a choice between scaring off investors before picking up momentum or sticking to their guns and becoming just another forgotten altcoin) which, at the time, was a move that was fundamentally against the original spirit of crypto, particularly in the wake of the Occupy Wallstreet movement. This, along with PoS giving a large share of voting power to the financial elite, gives them a blockchain they'll eventually be able to control.

ETH also has a figurehead that corporations, banks, and politicians hope to use the image of to manipulate certain narratives. This doesn't mean they'll be successful in doing so but it is the entire reason Satoshi remained anonymous.

Utility is the manpower to mine the iron ore to forge the tank using oil for energy in the process. Then going back and using again to power the tank via men, material, energy..

I get that some of the Ethereum community sounds elitist, but in many cases I think that people are bringing criticism to issues that either don’t make sense because they haven’t attempted to understand it with a Google searches, or where there are many people currently addressing those issues. I mean in the crypto world there are only a handful of projects who are trying to create a blockchain that prioritizes security, scalability, and decentralization. Of those projects, not a single one has fully prioritized all 3 in a smart contract platform, but among the ones that are, there is usually a clear roadmap for how to get there.

No one is complacent to the issues, no one is making decisions that are bad for the community out of greed. It’s literally that the technology is difficult to get right so we’re just not there yet. But if you want to push the needle forward, you can learn how it works and help these open source projects make progress, or you can wait unsure‍.

I’d really get it if there was true complacency. But how do you tell developers to work faster on something that everyone is already dedicating their full attention towards fixing. You can listen to the Dev calls or read the overviews of those who summarize them to get a sense of the progress.

""Visa recently announced that it will be connecting its global payments network to the US Dollar Coin (USDC), which is a digital coin developed on the Ethereum blockchain by Circle Internet Financial. This currency is now valued at nearly $3 billion, while Visa’s payment network has over 60 million merchants globally, which could increase the value of the coin by a huge rate, given just how many of them will be using any form of digital currency for the first time, thereby having a huge potential rate of growth. Visa itself will not be the custodian for the currency, but in partnership with Circle, it will soon begin identifying Visa credit card issuers to start integrating the USDC software into their payment platforms, and therefore start to process payments using the currency. Over time, businesses will be able to send payments in USDC to any business or merchant globally which is supported by Visa, and once those tokens are converted to the domestic currency, they can then be spent at any merchant which accepts Visa.

Circle is also part of Visa’s Fast Track program, following which Visa will issue a credit card which will allow business users to be able to send and receive payments in USDC directly by using the card. This is just one of Visa’s recent investments and forays into the crypto space. It had invested $40 million in a cryptocurrency startup recently, while it also applied for a patent for an application that could mint traditional currency on a blockchain network, and it is also working directly with a number of central banks towards their own digital currency launch efforts. All of this shows that Visa believes digital currencies will play a huge part in the future of payments and monetary systems.",positive,0.71223557,6

Secondly, and most importantly, you are losing loads of money in the exchange rate. How much longer would it take to send to a real exchange with an orderbook that you can place sell orders on, with that much money to exchange you'll save literally hundreds of dollars, and how many days work to recoup that cash via your active income, because you didn't spend a few extra hours waiting for a sell order to be filled!?

3234,2021-05-31,"The idea is that an occurrence which would yield an insurance prize would be automatically reported by an oracle like chainlink.

For instance, a farmer might buy drought or flood insurance through etherisc. The contract reads weather data from satellite photo or weather stations delivered by chainlink's oracle service. Say if it rains less than 4 inches or more than 200 inches in the period from November to April, as reported by weather.com, the contract will pay out the prize.

Because all the parameters and source of info are predetermined, you won't have any agents making judgement calls that favors the insurance company to meet some quota. It's like provably fair insurance. It's especially great because being able to insure your crop  normally requires to have a stable and developed economy.

If you “understand” what r/wallstreetbets is doing, then you’d know that they’re (we’re) actually sticking it to them and making them run for their money. While I’m monetarily and conceptually supportive of ETH, holding it right now doesn’t do anything to wall street. Many funds are long ETH so your primary statement doesn’t make a lot of sense.

ETH = competitive tech that is currently owned and being used to an extent by wall street and will eventually be fully adopted in some form

GME = is being used as a conduit by a large group of people to try and wipe out some wall street bastards who profit off of pushing companies into bankruptcy via price manipulation

That’s why ETH is not the same (for now). So, stop shilling to the shiny new enlarged audience (relax, a bunch of the new 4mlm users are bots anyway) and join us so we can stick it to those greedy fucks together.

3662,2021-06-08,"In both Lex interviews he explicitly mentions how he was treated with nothing but ""kindness"" as a ""nerd"" in primary and high school.  So many people with power have chips on their shoulders from bullying or experiencing 'unkindness' - either direct or indirect - through family and social structures many people in this world grow up in (rich or poor).  So first things first big shout out to Canada - my junior high school in Staten Island NY would have turned Vitalik into Cobra Commander or something.

Anyway, the kindness seems to have strongly imprinted on him, and that along with his intelligence, humility, and authenticity are one of the main reasons why I am super bullish on Ethereum leading the way in developing new blockchain capabilities, and ultimately drive the maturation of this technology.  Yes, attributing a decentralized platform's potential to one individual flies in the face of everything the technology is about; but in the real world certain individuals can be key leverage points in influencing large numbers of unaffiliated people (a decentralized group so to speak) to act in concert, and this gentleman is one of them.",positive,0.8656533,65

What's the insentive to use and develop dApps? From what I can make of it, it's quite expensive to deploy an app and quite expensive to use one, due to fees (gas fees if i got it right?). Some of the articles I've read mentioned a job searching app as an example, saying how great it is that it will never suffer from downtime and that it's open source. But I don't get why I would want to pay to use it when I can use e.g. linkedIn for free.

Ethereum is socially and technically built to take on the big platforms (Youtube, Google, Amazon, Facebook, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo), these are Ethereum's natural enemies

Bitcoin on the other hand is socially and technically built to take on the Fed, IRS, FATF...those entities are slow and don't follow the customer, matter of fact they are built to solve tragedy of the commons type problems.

The elderly can do what they need to do to protect themselves (which they ended up doing anyways) and the rest of society could operate as normal with maybe a few extra safety precautions.

As for obesity, it was clear back in early 2020 that obesity is the biggest factor for covid hospitalization and death after age but nobody was talking about it. We should have been encouraging everyone to get outdoors (where covid does not spread) and exercise (2-6x protection). Instead everyone was locked down (increase in obesity, depression, and anxiety [the 3rd biggest risk factor for covid severity]) indoors (where the virus spreads most). US childhood obesity increased >20% during lockdown and those are the children most affected by covid now.

I don't dispute that the vaccine works at reducing hospitalization and death, but it fades over time and its effects are severely reduced in obese people.

At the end of the day, the elected officials who hold the power to make the change you seek only care about one things, and it's NOT ""will this get me re-elected"".

You can’t use blockchain to evict someone for not paying rent or repossess a car or house for non-payment.

The is HUGE news. Here is why:

Santander sells the bond on day 1, but everyday after that, the bondholder must go to 'secondary markets' to sell his bond to someone else. Secondary market makers are very slow, inefficient, and most of all expensive. Bond trading on the secondary market loses tons of money to fees

These new bonds issued on ethereum blockchain will trade instantly for low fees between parties all over the world! The secondary market is HUGE and efficient. These bonds are WAY better then common bonds. Other bond issuance will follow. VERY soon, all bonds will be done this way - and all bond secondary markets and their outrageous fees will collapse.

4712,2022-02-02,"This ELI5 is either purposefully being misleading or doesn't understand what actually happened. Either way, you should edit this with the truth or delete it.

It was an epically more thought-out attack and know-how than you are giving the hacker credit for or the exploiting SOL architect's mistake. 

Here is what actually happened:

1. First, we had to determine where the exploit occurred. Ethereum, or Solana? A quick check of the encoded VM that the attacker submitted showed that it contained valid signatures from the guardians. This meant that either they got the private keys, or they exploited the bridge. Given that the attackers had left over $600MM in tokens in the bridge, I figured that the latter was more likely. Sure enough, there was a corresponding transaction on Solana where the attacker bridged out the ETH.

2. But how did the attacker get 120,000 ETH in the first place? That would be from this earlier transaction.

3. So what was going on in that transaction? We checked Wormhole's GitHub and determined that they must have called the `complete_wrapped` function.

4. But the `complete_wrapped` function requires a valid VAA. How did the attacker generate a VAA account that the bridge would accept? When we checked the VAA account that the attacker used, we found that it had been created in an even earlier transaction.

5. Specifically, in this transaction, the attacker called `post_vaa` on the main Wormhole bridge. So now we needed to figure out how the attacker managed to bypass the signature checks that `post_vaa` performs.

6. Well, the attacker provided a `SignatureSet` which was created in yet another transaction. This one called `verify_signatures` on the main bridge. The `verify_signatures` function is meant to take a set of signatures provided by the guardians and pack it into a `SignatureSet`. But it doesn't actually do any of the verification itself. Instead, it delegates that to the Secp256k1 program.


7. And herein lies the problem. The `solana_program::sysvar::instructions` mod is meant to be used with the Instructions sysvar, a sort of precompile on Solana. However, the version of `solana_program` that Wormhole used didn't verify the address being used. This meant that you could create your own account which stored the same data that the Instructions sysvar would have stored, and substituted that account for the Instruction sysvar in the call to `verify_signatures`. This would essentially bypass signature validation entirely. Sure enough, that's exactly what the attacker did. Hours earlier, they created this account which contained a single serialized instruction corresponding to a call to the Secp256k1 contract. Then they passed in that account as the Instruction sysvar. Once they had the fake `SignatureSet`, it was trivial to use it to generate a valid VAA and trigger an unauthorized mint to their own account. The rest is history.

[tl;dr - Wormhole didn't properly validate all input accounts, which allowed the attacker to spoof guardian signatures and mint 120,000 ETH on Solana, of which they bridged 93,750 back to Ethereum.](https://twitter.com/samczsun/status/1489044939732406275)

Listen, I'm an ETH die-hard but spreading fud is despicable. And finally, it was discovered the fix was written but the team hadn't deployed it to the network before the attack happened.

You don't really address the fact that it is rewarding those that are already wealthy enough to represent a wealth-based centralization.

As of right now, ETH is over $4k - even if I had 32ETH I am not so wealthy that it's reasonable for me to lock a (possible) $120k of ETH into a stake instead of literally cashing it out and paying off more than half of my mortgage. Even if ETH would crash *right now* down to $2k, it would still be wildly irresponsible for me to lock that away when I have good uses of it today.

Then when I bring this up to people, they say ""you can stake with smaller amounts- Just use a staking pool!"" which is just moving the centralization problem down the line a bit.

4870,2021-05-12,"I think this is a great post and I agree with all of this, but one small criticism - this part feels a little disingenuous:

>Firstly, the DAO fork was not a rollback. It was a unique situation where the hackers had to wait 28 days for withdrawals, so a smart contract change was executed.

>EIP-999 being rejected is the final deathblow to this hypothesis. There was a chance to rollback 500,000 ETH to an entity managed by one of its co-founders, and the community overwhelmingly rejected it. **Rollbacks do not happen on Ethereum.**

Was it technically a chain rollback? No. But, in the commonly understood spirit of the term, was it a rollback? Yes, it was. Every layman would consider it a rollback. It required a hardfork, it resulted in reverting a state in which a lot of ETH was about to be siphoned to an attacker's wallet, etc.

It's certainly true that Bitcoin also had a rollback in its youth and that this is a complex issue, but there's no point sugarcoating it. Conceptually speaking, it was a rollback.

This point is often the number one gripe technical/freedom-minded people bring up when they talk about why they don't like Ethereum, so I think it's very important to steelman the opposition and use the most accurate and objective language possible when discussing it. It's something that should be discussed openly rather than minimized or legalese'd away. That's what'll make the project stronger in the long run.",positive,0.8905658,5
4871,2021-05-12,"You didn’t really address why the criticisms are pertinent.

We all know ethereum can scale, either through L1 or L2 and many different methodologies. The issues about scaling are: 

Friction - with multiple L2 competing solutions a person will have to move between layers multiple times inviting gas fees every time. This isn’t adequate for business and small transactions which are vital for larger adoption. Bridges will come but this won’t be quick and will have a range of issues themselves as they are developed.

Security - Ethereum isn’t using something like UTxO to give additional security when it is operating off-chain. Due to the nature of finance does ethereum provide enough security for L2?

Split liquidity - the value of ethereum is currently stored in ETH but with the growth of L2 roll ups people may decide to stay entirely on one of those rather than have to deal with gas fees, many do this already. This has the potential to effect the value of ETH significantly. We are also seeing the problem with people using binance with sidechains completely ignoring ethereum, this is close to a fatal flaw in my opinion.

Long term compatibility - Will ethereum choose a singular L2 solution to combat the security issues and if so what happens to competing L2 solutions and the content hosted on them.

Data handling - how much data do these blocks hold post-sharding and what’s the long term scalability target. Certain types of processes will not be possible off-chain due to security. Even with 1000tps this doesn’t look like enough to facilitate millions of users on one protocol demanding data intensive processes that compete with current systems and it’s also got to hold multiple of these. 

Take Steam, at the time of writing there are currently 21.5m active users online, if they were to switch part of their system to smart contracts such as ownership, rewards, identity systems, as well as tokens and interoperability with all the different developers and their unique blockchain related products. There is no way in hell ethereum can handle this type of load with anything announced. Right now Ethereum can’t handle much load at all and this is with small data requirements, you saw what doge did the other day to fees and that’s just a token.

For other blockchains their starting point is 1000tps able to hold lots of data with targets of 50000tps at significantly faster processing times, or secure integrated L2, or multiple unique blockchains with their own throughput that can then seamlessly connect with others. All of these are aiming to support this load and building systems specifically for big business.

At the moment these issues can’t be addressed as what may happen is speculation and why they are the criticism and it’s up to developers to solve these issues. 

Developers that started with Ethereum with larger goals have gone elsewhere. If it wants to hit its vision rather than be a prototype blockchain it needs to be able to support millions on multiple protocols at any one time with the potential for multiple user spikes at any one time.

4877,2021-05-12,"To be honest I don't think most ETH users really care about the tech or what sharding, sidechains, level 1, level 2, level 3, TPS reports, or any of that is. In fact to this American sharding sounds like an unfortunate accident. ""Excuse me. Which way to the bathroom. I was passing some gas and think I may have sharded in my pants.""

What people want to do is exchange tokens, invest in Defi, create and buy NFTs, and maybe play a video/computer game. It doesn't matter why gas fees are high. It only matters that they are high. For someone investing in ETH the increase in gas fees is good value. Buy they are buying and holding in hope to sell high. For someone using ETH (frequent token trading or spending, DeFi, NFT, games) it doesn't increase the value. In fact it becomes a deterant.

Now you might think this process takes care of itself. As fees increase people decide to delay or simply not do a transaction. Then as utilization drops off those that didn't get a chance to participate can now participate at a lower fee rate that is more reasonable for them. This is were you'd be wrong. In practice what happens is a fee floor is created. While the amount of ETH required to pay the fee may drop the cost of the fee with respect to fiat stays the same. Now you have people who will never be able to afford the fees which means that they won't be able to utilize any of ETHs functions.

What I'm seeing now are people and businesses offering a service where you can pool your money then execute one transaction as a group which has the effect of reducing fees by splitting the fees among the users in the group. Essentially creating centralized groups in order to be able to participate in decentralization. This isn't the vision promised by the DeFi movement. Which then makes you question if DeFi is even possible on ETH? Will token exchanges be limited to only institutions? Are NTFs only affordable to the rich? I can see a use case for gaming since there needs to be some centralization by nature. The game company can share the fees across their user base and incorporate the fees in to their own subscription fees essentially making the fees invisible to their players.",positive,0.8804025,6

It only has to 7x from here to cost $1M USD to run a staking node - which could happen very soon.

You can run a Bitcoin full node on a couple hundred bucks worth of hardware, for comparison.

Pancakeswap is the perfect example as they now process more transactions than not just Uniswap, but the entire Eth chain. Solana, Algo, Cardano... what happens when you have a dozen systems that do exactly what ETH does but at 90% or more cheaper? If you don't think projects are going to jump ship, you are insane.

2) You blow off the fact that most of what is being done is speculative (or as you say ""degenerates gambling"", saying that at least those are transactions that generate revenue. Again, this ties back to the idea that those ""degenerates"" keep gambling on ETH. You already have, as I stated above, a mass exodus to Pancakeswap due to fees.

zkSync 2.0 and StarkNet will bring general purpose smart contracts with all the composability that benefits Ethereum dapps.

dYdX and Immutable X will have to migrate from their individual single-purpose rollups to the shared rollup of StarkNet, at which point they could in theory interact with each other and all other dapps on the rollup.

Buying a single digit % of ETH from 90% of the supply which is floating is going to be much cheaper than buying an equivalent quantity of AVAX. That’s because 65% of AVAX is staked, so you need to buy the entire floating supply and wait for 15% of the avax supply to unlock from staking and buy that as well.

BSV is not insecure. This is a lie or totally ignorance of how Bitcoin work from your side. I was there myself when a unsuccessful attempt was tried at a 51% attack. Bitcoin didn't skip a beat. You see, honest nodes control the network and that is what make up the security of Bitcoin. The publication of hash headers has nothing to do with the security.

5279,2022-02-28,"More efficient, more secure, more decentralised.

Other chains use a variation of PoS called DPoS (delegated proof-of-stake), where the protocol itself allows users to delegate some or even all of their funds to a certain validator, allowing them to gain passive rewards without needing to run a validator themselves, while also helping to prop up whoever they're delegating to.

DPoS can trend towards centralisation due to this delegation aspect which also hurts security (more so than PoW, since PoS relies so much on peer verification to keep everybody in check), and it's also typically less efficient since the validator selection algorithm has to take a validator's balance into account, which is a non-trivial problem to solve.

Ethereum's PoS is more akin to a ""pure"" (*not to be confused with Algorand's Pure Proof-of-Stake*) form of PoS, in that users are unable to natively delegate their funds to help prop up a validator, rather a validator needs to stake their own funds entirely. Delegation *can* be a thing, but it has to be done outside of the protocol, with an external system managing the delegation process.

Due to this, Ethereum's PoS is more decentralised and hence more secure, as delegation isn't natively supported and hence validators can't be propped up as easily, and it's also more efficient as Ethereum takes a shortcut and does away with a validator's balance in the validator selection algorithm, instead giving all validators an equal chance to be selected, forcing those with more funds to literally run more validators.

At the same time, this also means that Ethereum's PoS is less approachable from the perspective of a small scale staker, as you have to venture outside of the protocol and into external delegation platforms, which may or may not have security and centralisation risks in their own right.",positive,0.73581785,39

I’m on the fence about opening a kraken or binance account just to try to grab gains, but long term I want decentralization. I hope ethereum as a community can understand though that at the finish line so to speak no one cares what it took to get there. It’s great to be the innovators and inventors, but history is full of leaders laying face down with arrows in their backs. Competitors will take the growth and then release it today as it always should have been rather than being saddled by old ways of operating. To the public at large, cryptocurrency is not decentralization it’s about digital money, period. They don’t really understand why decentralization is a core important part of it. That will come, but the hard truth is that if ethereum doesn’t get their collective foot on the pedal and GO it’s going to be swallowed by the tides. If you think every token and dapp isn’t porting to binance sc right now because they made it easy to do and affordable for people to use it as a low we platform, you are nuts. While decentralization is core to digital currency and defi in general, day to day users who need to transact simply cannot afford to f with ethereum. Period. Full stop. End of story. Either that changes, and I’m talking fast as developers can do so responsibly, or get swallowed by the next wave rising up right behind you. 

I hold ETH, BTc, and many tokens for ethereum. This is absolutely distracting to see completely lazy copy but the market does. Not. Care. They want it to work. NOW.

Just playing devils advocate. The biggest pain point I see is the total lack of clarity around what these tokens do and what these coins are for. There is so much intentional obfuscation of utility with each tokens write up about itself that you can’t expect the average market goer to understand or read all the white papers. The market is here. Now. Ethereum isn’t ready. As a network and community they have been saddled with the problems of huge corporations... they have to turn the titanic and during that period someone will try to come in with a newly invented iPhone and say look: it just works.

Apps, hell you name it and I’ve written it marketed it and sold it to the masses. That’s where I’m coming from.

I’m holding ethereum and I believe in all it stands for but you cannot operate in a vacuum. Don’t despair, but LOOK at the world and how it moves, even if it’s STUPID, the impact is RELEVANT. 

We GOTTA. MOVE. To l2. YESTERDAY.

Edit:

To be super clear here, I’m on the ethereum train and I’m not getting off. I’m just taking about this particular moment in time. Any network or platform CAN be dissolved. Losing against competition in the public eye can be looked at like aggressive shorting in the stock market. Falling behind matters, because it has the psychological effect of shorting. It’s a vote of no confidence.

5380,2021-03-08," I think PayPal entering Crypto is a  great thing. I guess there is a reluctance for anarcho-capitalist  cypherpunks to acknowledge the security and assurances banks are legally  obliged to provide.

Your grandma who still writes checks isn't going manage her own private keys for the sake of sticking one to the bankers.  
That  doesn't mean your grandma won't be using crypto with a layer of  abstraction that insures her finances in a way that hides the underlying  complexities of crypto while utilising its efficiency.

PayPal  is well poised to provide a centralised and trusted mechanism that can  launch the masses onto the blockchain without them having to know  anything about cryptography. Not necessarily a bad thing.

I  think it's likely that crypto will be an almost invisible aspect of  PayPals business. Hidden behind a complex authentication mechanism like  facial recognition, you might be looking at new shoes on the internet  and find them delivered by drone the next day with the payment initiated  by opening the box and completed once you have been spotted wearing  them out in the wild.

There's a very simple solution. Even simpler than EIP-1559. It could be rolled out as a hard fork tomorrow. **Hard code a larger block gas limit**. Yes the miners will bitch and moan. They may even try splitting Ethereum. Let them try. The vast majority of actual users will migrate to the hard fork where transaction fees aren't $1,000+.

Let me be clear. This is a quick and dirty hack. But the technology graveyard is littered with projects that failed, because the engineers were too busy building the most elegant scalable solution, instead of getting a better product to market. Increase the block limit today. Then migrate to EIP-1559 in the medium term. Then in the long-term we'll move to Eth2 sharding.

You still have to pay 112eth because of traffic.

Tbh, people should really learn to read and understand the actual eip 1559 protocol.


Plus this one is outlier cuz this block contains the same actions as in 84eth block in Jan. 
Someone compete each other on bot auto liquidating on Compound or MakerDAO. 
So they use abnormally high amount of eth (they used like 10000 Gwei or something).

Your transaction gets stuck for more than 20 minutes and you still get slapped with a massive fee for doing nothing. Thanks for doing business. thumbs down

The good news. This is being solved by:

- 1559 to improve UX and make gas estimation more consistent and means your transaction will get included despite gas price volatility. When: London hard fork.

- The merge to PoS and Data sharding to increase  Layer 1 throughput and hopefully reduce gas prices. When : later this year (the merge) and into next year (data sharding)

- Launch of Layer 2 solutions to take pressure off Layer 1 and provide quick and cheap execution for non-whales. When: Optimism and Starknet are on the horizon, but you can and should get familiar with Polygon and Loopring today.

If you’re not a millionaire, then its typically better to bridge to Polygon and swap with Quickswap than to risk the above. A lot of volume has moved over there in the last few days.

5801,2021-09-27,"Let's look at it from a legal standpoint.  I am not an expert on civil law or in fact any law but I know a few things.  Let's pretend both parties are in the US and arguing this matter in some civil court.

A crypto transaction can be seen as a contract between the transaction creator and the miner.  The contract terms are basically, include this transaction in the next block and your payment is the mining fee.

The argument for the miner keeping it:  When you use the ethereum network you are agreeing to being bound by the rules of the network, embodied in the various documents and  in the code.  By those rules, the funds are mine.  I fulfilled the duties of the contract, which is to validate and include the transaction in the block.  Furthermore, there was an offer (transmitting the transaction on the network) and acceptance (being included in the block).  This also satisfies the requirement of offer and acceptance for a valid legal contract.

The argument for the miner returning it:  While the ethereum network doesn't allow for mistakes, the law does.  There is a missing element in this contact, which is a meeting of the minds.  That could not have occurred because to reasonable person would agree to this contract after understanding the terms.  This was in essence an obvious clerical error.  (There is probably some case law on contracts with the wrong number of decimal places an no one catching it).  The fee paid was several orders of magnitude too high for the service rendered.  Anyone can look at the facts and see this was a mistake, therefor not a valid contract.  We aren't claiming the miner did anything wrong, just that the contract was invalid and the funds should be returned (less a reasonable fee).

I honestly don't know which way a court would rule on this case.  I imagine both sides would end up paying a lot of legal fees to find out.",positive,0.6153441,9

I think you focussed a bit too much on aesthetics and not enough on the core of what you are building. Which is the course itself.

1. Failure as a Payment Method
Many might praise Bitcoin for its innovative features, but what’s so innovative about having higher fees and slower transaction times than any bank on earth? When this is mentioned, Bitcoiners will quickly change the subject to the fictitious “lightning network”, which is a typical red herring fallacy.
Contrary to popular belief, the Lightning network is NOT Bitcoin. It’s a fully centralized system that isn’t settled on the BTC Network and can only sustain less than 0.00001% of users, which means it will never work on a large-scale population. It’s a common distraction BTC promoters use to avoid the elephant in the room, Bitcoin is expensive, slow, and unscalable.
Fun fact: Bitcoin processes less than 4.6 transactions per second, while Visa does around 1,700+ transactions per second on average. Even with less than 1% of the world having dabbled in Bitcoin, we’ve seen so many instances of scalability issues, imagine what would happen on an even larger scale?",positive,0.70772934,6

Ever since this bull run made global headlines, regulators from around the world have been focusing their efforts on the crypto markets. While some compliant projects will survive, the majority are in for a harsh reality.
While regulators already know that regulating Bitcoin will be hard, if not impossible, they have something else they are going after. Stable coins.
In the near future, countries will adopt strict policies that restrict stable coins like Tether, and USDC from engaging in certain activities such as money laundering, and price manipulation. While these regulations will be overall beneficial to the community in the long run as it eliminates fraud, they will still likely have a negative impact on the prices of many assets that are dependant on stable coins.
Countries have been hinting at regulations for many months now, so don’t be surprised when they are eventually introduced. Just last week, America’s largest financial regulators met to discuss stablecoins, with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen emphasizing “the need to act quickly to ensure there is an appropriate U.S. regulatory framework in place,” for these digital assets.
In addition, the government has dozens of other options to tame Bitcoin. They can shut down centralized exchanges, ban Bitcoin mining, ban citizens from trading Bitcoin, restrict internet access to certain crypto platforms, and be more strict with KYC/AML requirements.",positive,0.8538746,-1

Today, I have .112 ETH, and that $300ish dollars it took was a sizeable investment (for me). 5-10 years from now, I expect the internet to be a very different place than it is now, in the same way that the internet is a very different place now than it was 5-10 years ago (social media, mostly). In the future that I see, you're going to need small amounts of ETH to do just about anything worthwhile, say maybe .0002 ETH a week or something like that. I'm gonna need to buy that ETH at some point, and in 5-10 years when it is in much higher demand, it's going to cost me 10-20x (or more) more than what I paid to acquire it now.

6122,2021-04-26,"I agree. I was explaining to friends, trying to draw a parallel between Crypto and traditional investments. I think I found a good analogy.

Real Estate is always a good sound investment. Not only is Real Estate a limited resource, thus has a natural hedge against inflation, but Real Estate can also be leverage as an asset into additional spaces of investment. The mere fact that  you own land, opens the possibility of other ventures, such as running a farm, building malls/apartment complexes, etc. These can gain profits *on top* (pun intended) of the asset that is already gaining value.

Bitcoin, at the moment, doesn't have a landscape (pun not intended) to be leveraged into additional ventures. Ethereum can, and will. Ethereum's SoV status is compounded by any service running atop Ethereum, just as Real Estate's value is compounded by whatever services require Real Estate to function.

The added benefit we're seeing that is a new dynamic, is that this asset you own also is required to participate, adding some global scaling of value. So if you purchase Ethereum and stake it, you gain APY on an asset that is limited in supply, has entire economic systems built on top of it, all while the global supply is being burned for it to operate, which increases the value of your base investment, APY, and any stake in services hosted on Ethereum (e.g. governance tokens, NFTs).",positive,0.8529799,23

To me this is the absolute biggest thing that's happened with ETH since its ICO, so I wanted to weigh in.

However, I think it also makes the USD likely more ubiquitous as an almost accidental side effect.  Here is my reasoning:

The Fed and banks will create their own stable coins because it makes bankers far more efficient.  The fear of ""banning crypto"" has reduced substantially.  However, the Western world doesn't have the wherewithal to just make every blockchain engineer work on a single project like China Coin, so they'll plug into ETH at random bridges.  This means that Ethereum will increasingly underlie the Western financial system, and its use makes that network's crypto valuable because all transactions require ETH to move.  It also means that the Fed-Coin USD, through its network of banks with their own coins, will necessarily need to interface with ETH.  It also means the biggest decentralized network on planet earth will have an easy incremental plug into the US financial system almost by accident, and this, at the margin, contrasts with China which will have a centralized digital currency that is much more opaque.  The Fed might not even have to engage in overt QE anymore because decentralized stable coin networks will basically do that for them.

6210,2021-09-16,"The full article:

“The sceptics have plenty of fodder. The earliest adopters of bitcoin, the original cryptocurrency, used it to buy drugs, while cyber-hackers now demand their ransom in it. Hundreds of millions of dollars of ether, another digital money, were stolen this year after hackers found a bug in some code. Many “believers” are in reality trying to get rich quick from the global mania that has seen the value of cryptoassets reach $2.2trn. Others are freakishly devoted. The entrepreneur who announced in June that El Salvador was adopting bitcoin as an official currency sobbed on stage, claiming it would save the nation.

The crooks, fools and proselytisers are off-putting. Nevertheless, the rise of an ecosystem of financial services, known as decentralised finance, or “DeFi”, deserves sober consideration. It has the potential to rewire how the financial system works, with all the promise and perils that entails. The proliferation of innovation in DeFi is akin to the frenzy of invention in the early phase of the web. At a time when people live ever more of their lives online, the crypto-revolution could even remake the architecture of the digital economy.

DeFi is one of three tech trends disrupting finance. Tech “platform” firms are muscling in on payments and banks. Governments are launching digital currencies, or govcoins. DeFi offers an alternative path which aims to spread power, not concentrate it. To understand how, start with blockchains, vast networks of computers that keep an open, incorruptible common record and update it without the need for a central authority.

Bitcoin, the first big blockchain, created in 2009, is now a distraction. Instead, Ethereum, a blockchain network created in 2015, upon which most DeFi applications are built, is reaching critical mass. Its developers view finance as a juicy target. Conventional banking requires a huge infrastructure to maintain trust between strangers, from clearing houses and compliance to capital rules and courts. It is expensive and often captured by insiders: think of credit-card fees and bankers’ yachts. By contrast, transactions on a blockchain are trustworthy, cheap, transparent and quick—at least in theory.

Although the terminology is intimidating (fees are “gas”; the main currency is ether, and title deeds over digital assets are known as nfts), the basic activities taking place on DeFi are familiar. These include trading on exchanges and issuing loans and taking deposits through self-executing agreements called smart contracts. One yardstick of activity is the value of digital instruments being used as collateral: from almost nothing in early 2018 it has reached $90bn. Another is the value of transactions that Ethereum is verifying. In the second quarter this reached $2.5trn, around the same sum as Visa processes and equivalent to a sixth of the activity on Nasdaq, a stock exchange.

The dream of a low-friction financial system is just the beginning. DeFi is spreading to more ambitious terrain. MetaMask, a DeFi wallet with more than 10m users acts as a digital identity. To enter a decentralised “metaverse”, a looking-glass world with shops run by its users, you link your wallet to a cartoonish avatar who roams around. These digital worlds will become the subject of intensifying competition as more spending shifts online. Big tech firms could impose huge taxes on these mini-economies: imagine Apple’s App Store charging fees, or Facebook selling your avatar’s intimate secrets. A better alternative might be decentralised networks that host applications and are run mutually by users. DeFi could provide payments and property rights.

Crypto-enthusiasts see a Utopia. But there is a long way to go before DeFi is as reliable as, say, JPMorgan Chase or PayPal. Some problems are prosaic. A common criticism is that blockchain platforms do not scale easily and that the computers they harness consume wasteful amounts of electricity. But Ethereum is a self-improvement machine. When it is in high demand the fees it charges for verification can climb, encouraging developers to work on minimising the intensity with which they use it. There will be new versions of Ethereum; other, better blockchains could one day replace it.

Yet DeFi also raises questions about how a virtual economy with its own norms interacts with the real world. One worry is the lack of an external anchor of value. Cryptocurrencies are no different from the dollar, in that they rely on people having a shared expectation of their utility. However, conventional money is also backed by states with a monopoly on force and central banks that are lenders of last resort. Without these, DeFi will be vulnerable to panics. Contract enforcement outside the virtual world is also a concern. A blockchain contract may say you own a house but only the police can enforce an eviction.

Governance and accountability in DeFi-land are rudimentary. A sequence of large irrevocable transactions that humans cannot override could be dangerous, especially as coding errors are inevitable. Money-laundering has thrived in the ungoverned grey zone of services lying between Ethereum and the banking system. Despite the claims of decentralisation, some programmers and app owners hold disproportionate sway over the DeFi system. And a malign actor could even gain control over a majority of the computers that run a blockchain.

Digital libertarians would prefer that DeFi remain autonomous—imperfect but pure. Yet to succeed it must integrate with the conventional financial and legal systems, as Gary Gensler, a crypto-expert who is America’s financial watchdog, has outlined. Many DeFi applications are run by decentralised organisations which vote on some issues; these bodies should become subject to laws and regulations. The Bank for International Settlements, a club for central banks, has suggested that govcoins might be used in DeFi apps, providing stability.

Finance is entering a new era in which the three novel but flawed visions of tech platforms, big government and DeFi will compete and intermingle. Each embodies a technical architecture and an ideology about how the economy should be run. As with the internet in the 1990s, no one knows where the revolution will end. But it stands to transform how money works and, as it does so, the entire digital world.”",positive,0.8261366,302

You want people to play around on a pseudo decentralized chain like BSC while gas prices are so high.  Let them learn to use Metamask and learn to swap coins, etc.  It only expands the market.  Ultimately, BSC will fail if their goal is to replace Ethereum.  Only a fully decentralized chain can win long term.  Do you think Bitcoin would still be around today if there was a person (CZ) governments could subpoena?  Hardly...

My vision for the future is a solar system, with Ethereum 2.0 (L1) as the sun, and lots of different projects (planets) circulating around Ethereum's L1:  BSC, Polkadot, Cosmos, Ethereum L2's, Solana, etc.  

So how to play this?  Ethereum core devs should stay focused and continue to deliver according to plan.  That is our key success factor, God bless 'em.  Ethereum will win, if they, and the community, stay focused on 2.0.

Also, look at projects that connect all of this together, the ""gravity"" that holds the planets in orbit around the sun.  Projects like REN, RUNE, and others that help connect our multichain worlds together.  They will be key over the next 3-5 years.

UX is EVERYTHING. No digital product will win the market without utterly exceptional UX. There is a reason that Apple is Apple and android phones can do things first but lack fundamental simplicity. Simplicity makes us calm, makes us feel accomplished through our tasks. Simplicity is beautiful and any object, digital or physical, is statistically proven to have stronger and longer adoption.

BNB at the moment makes users feel like they are doing things well, and making money. They feel like it’s easy and they “get” crypto and thus, the masses will use it.

Ethereum is wildly complex for a user, with no discernible entry point beyond putting money into Ethereum and hoping it goes up. They have little to no way to actually USE Ethereum network to accomplish daily tasks unless they are playing with tens of thousands of dollars. 

With the majority of Ethereum developers and proponents being quite a bit more OG in the crypto space than the public we all so desperately REQUIRE to adopt ETH and there in network usage, OG Users are fine but new ones they do not have tens of thousands of dollars. They have third world wages, minimum USD wages. As such, point blank, this cannot be a world solution. They are investing their tiny $100, their tiny $500.

Migration is a pain, but I rather pay one big fee and then pennies for all my transactions afterwards and dont forget that fees support the health and demand of the network to a certain extent. L2 won't solve the issue on it's own, but will reduce the traffic on L1 enough to leave some room to breath for fees. 

Most crypto investors know about the shadiness of BNB, but they do offer a good product in the current climat, but it wont last, to many downsides for the benefits. The situation is not ideal, but just because BNB got pumped and Ada is getting hyped up,  it's far from the disaster it make it out to be, far from it. Ethereum is the victim of it's own success, no other coin has been as tested or as used as Ethereum in crypto and it's growing by the day.

As others have said, I think it's actually good for Ethereum that new users can easily try defi like products, even if it's on centralized chains like Binance chain.

Yes, it's disgusting how Binance is abusing the popularity of blockchain and defi, by simply copying code (while ditching the decentralized parts), giving no credit where it's due, and that they even are shitting on the projects they copy and pasted from!

I also think Binance users should be made aware of CZ's practices, and be aware of the high risks of centralized products like Binance chain.

But, on the positive side, I am quite sure L2 solutions (some of which are already available now) will grow tremendously this year! At some point centralized exchanges will provide easy and cheap access to the L2 chains. Exchanges that won't do this soon enough will lose big parts of their market share.

Actually it might be very well be that those L2's will soon be Binances killers! If one of the other big exchanges manages to integrate nicely with L2, Binance might be in big trouble, unless they switch to the L2 train themselves of course.

Personally I prefer using any of the L2's very much over using centralized products like Binance offers, and I am sure I am not the only one.
I'm also sure L2 usage will grow exponentially this year, especially when it will be cheaper to hop on to them.

There are bridges between Ethereum mainnet and Binance smartchain so you can view bsc as a sidechain to Ethereum. If you want to swap a few dollars of shitcoins you use bsc with lower security and if you use defi with a few thousand dollar you want to use the mainnet and the fees have less of an impact.
Layer 2 will be a major game changer and its being rolled out now.
Just wait there will soon be ways of getting from sidechains to Ethereum layer 2 directly so you could also view these sidechains as an on / off ramp to the mainnet.

I like that you countered the BTC maxis argument of centralisation with PoS. I agree its quite the opposite, with PoS if a guy is 100x richer than you, he gets 100x more rewards. With PoW the guy who is 100x richer than you have the ability and social networking to buy more and cheaper rigs and to secure much cheaper electricity, so at the end he gets much more than 100x rewards.

This also hits decentralisation at a different angle by centralizing mining at big mining facilities at places with cheap electricity, and the effect of this was seen during the Xinjiang blackout when the Bitcoin network lost over 45% of its hash rate.

At that moment in time, all China needed to do to take over the Bitcoin network was to take control over the big chinese mining facilities and turn them against the network with impunity because there is no defense mechanism with PoW. With PoS unlike PoW, nobody knows where the validators are and you get slashed if you want to play dirty.

Want to add also that after The Merge, even if there is sell the news event, circulating ETH will suffer a huge supply shock comparable to 2-3 Bitcoin halvenings at once and in the next few months the price will start rising quite fast till it reaches it's new equilibrium.

I don't believe in the sell the news event thesis, quite the opposite, a successful merge will send shockwaves not only through the crypto world but outside aswell.

AFAIK those quotes also came from a place of having a partially finished specification for Casper FFG, a hybrid PoW-PoS mechanism that ended up being scrapped.

If the Ethereum devs had decided to move forward with that spec instead of scrapping it (which was absolutely the right call due to the hybrid system's fragility imo), then 2018 may have been a realistic launch date.

Another idea i've had is to combine this concept with something like cryptokitties, where each sample is represented by a hash that encodes things like volume, eq, and various effects parameters. This would be similar to how each cryptokitty has their various features like ears, tails, etc encoded.

Instead of layering samples for a DJ mix, you just layer the NFT addresses as if THEY ARE the samples inside Ableton or Protools, or whatever DAW you are entertaining from. Artists that create the Samples will host them on IPFS and be paid for the data streaming, the NFT is just a link to the audio source data. If a singer decided to remove their voice from a track, they can just raise the price of the NFT or remove the source data... all the songs that already HAVE those samples can easily be streamed without the specific parts, or be instantly replace on a global scale with a simple Hash replacement. How do you work with data like this to even build it up in the first place? The next step is a VST with Wallet Integration for IPFS streaming a sample library.

Dragonchain has demonstrated **twice Reddit’s entire total daily volume (votes, comments, and posts** [**per Reddit 2019 Year in Review**](https://redditblog.com/2019/12/04/reddits-2019-year-in-review/)**)** in a [24-hour demo](https://youtu.be/pSfBid1_US4) on an operational network.  Every single transaction on Dragonchain is decentralized immediately through 5 levels of Dragon Net, and then secured with combined proof on **Bitcoin**, **Ethereum**, **Ethereum Classic**, and **Binance Chain**, via Interchain. At the time, in January 2020, the entire cost of the demo was approximately $25K on a single system (transaction fees locked at $0.0001/txn). With current fees (lowest fee $0.0000025/txn), this would cost as little as $625.

If you’d like to read the full proposal with formatting go to the [Dragonchain blog](https://dragonchain.com/blog/reddit-ethereum-blockchain-scalability).

## Hello Reddit and Ethereum community!

I’m Joe Roets, Founder & CEO of Dragonchain. When the team and I first heard about The Great Reddit Scaling Bake-Off we were intrigued. We believe we have the solutions Reddit seeks for its community points system and we have them at scale.

For your consideration, we have submitted our proposal below. The team at Dragonchain and I welcome and look forward to your technical questions, philosophical feedback, and fair criticism, to build a scaling solution for Reddit that will empower its users. Because our architecture is unlike other blockchain platforms out there today, we expect to receive many questions while people try to grasp our project. I will personally answer all questions across two locations. First, I will be live on a special episode of Super Happy Dragon Lucky, Tuesday, July 28th at **6PM EST** where I will answer questions. I will then answer all questions here in this thread on Reddit.

We have seen good discussions so far in the competition. We hope that Reddit’s scaling solution will emerge from The Great Reddit Scaling Bake-Off and that Reddit will have great success with the implementation.

## Executive summary

Dragonchain is a robust open source hybrid blockchain platform that has proven to withstand the passing of time since our inception in 2014. We have continued to evolve to harness the scalability of private nodes, yet take full advantage of the security of public decentralized networks, like Ethereum. We have a live, operational, and fully functional Interchain network integrating Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, and \~700 independent Dragonchain nodes. Every transaction is secured to Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Ethereum Classic. Transactions are immediately usable on chain, and the first decentralization is seen within 20 seconds on Dragon Net. Security increases further to public networks ETH, BTC, and ETC within 10 minutes to 2 hours.

Smart contracts can be written in any executable language, offering full freedom to existing developers. We invite any developer to watch the demo, play with our SDK’s, review open source code, and to help us move forward. Dragonchain specializes in scalable loyalty & rewards solutions and has built a decentralized social network on chain, with very affordable transaction costs. This experience can be combined with the insights Reddit and the Ethereum community have gained in the past couple of months to roll out the solution at a rapid pace.

In *The Great Reddit Scaling Bake-Off* post, Reddit has asked for a series of demonstrations, requirements, and other considerations. In this section, we will attempt to answer all of these requests.

## Live Demo

>A live proof of concept showing hundreds of thousands of transactions

On Jan 7, 2020, Dragonchain hosted a 24-hour live demonstration during which a quarter of a billion (250 million+) transactions executed fully on an operational network. **Every single transaction** on Dragonchain is decentralized immediately through 5 levels of Dragon Net, and then secured with **combined proof** on **Bitcoin**, **Ethereum**, **Ethereum Classic**, and **Binance Chain**, via Interchain. This means that every single transaction is secured by, and traceable to these networks. An attack on this system would require a simultaneous attack on all of the Interchained networks.

**24 hours in 4 minutes:** [**https://youtu.be/pSfBid1\_US4**](https://youtu.be/pSfBid1_US4)

The demonstration was of a single business system, and any user is able to scale this further, by running multiple systems simultaneously. Our goals for the event were to demonstrate a consistent capacity greater than that of Visa over an extended time period.

Tooling to reproduce our demo is available here:

## Scaling

>How it works & scales

## Architectural Scaling

Dragonchain’s architecture attacks the scalability issue from multiple angles. Dragonchain is a hybrid blockchain platform, wherein every transaction is protected on a business node to the requirements of that business or purpose. A business node may be held completely private or may be exposed or replicated to any level of exposure desired.

Every node has its own blockchain and is independently scalable. Dragonchain established *Context Based Verification* as its consensus model. Every transaction is immediately usable on a trust basis, and in time is provable to an increasing level of decentralized consensus. A transaction will have a level of decentralization to independently owned and deployed Dragonchain nodes (\~700 nodes) within seconds, and full decentralization to BTC and ETH within minutes or hours. Level 5 nodes (Interchain nodes) function to secure all transactions to public or otherwise external chains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. These nodes scale the system by aggregating multiple blocks into a single Interchain transaction on a cadence. This timing is configurable based upon average fees for each respective chain.

For detailed information about Dragonchain’s architecture, and *Context Based Verification*, please refer to the [Dragonchain Architecture Document](https://dragonchain.com/Dragonchain-Architecture.pdf).",positive,0.8831523,196

6756,2020-06-18,"> Security. Users have full ownership & control of their points.

This is the most stringent requirement in this document. The consequence of having this level of security for user assets is that it must auditable by all parties, and therefore must be made available to all parties. At this time, the only known solution to the data availability problem [[1]] are blockchains themselves. A probabilistic solution has been proposed [[2]] and is currently being implemented in Ethereum 2 Phase 1. Any scaling solution that does not post all input data on-chain is insecure with respect to this requirement.

Only one category of scaling solution possesses this kind of security: rollups. They come in two flavors, optimistic [[3]] and zero-knowledge [[4]]. Because avoiding ""moon math"" is preferred and ZK-rollups are generally very expensive to compute, let's focus on optimistic rollups (ORU). The ORU derives its name from the fact that its values should be treated optimistically. To update an ORU, a relayer will submit on-chain all the transactions they wish to include in the ORU's next block + the resulting state root of the next block. It's possible that the relayer submitted an incorrect root, so users must treat this root optimistically until either they i) verify for themselves that the txs do evaluate to the new root or ii) reach a level of confidence (k-deep some might say [[5]]) in the current progress of the chain. Because all data is posted on-chain, all parties can verify all transactions from the beginning of the ORU. Assuming a robust leader-election algorithm, the ORU will inherit the same safety and liveness properties of the base chain. So how much is it going to cost?

The requirement for the POC is 300,000 txs over a 5 day period. That's 6MB per day if we assume transactions are roughly 100B each [[6]]. Ethereum is currently seeing around 6,400 blocks [[7]] mined a day with an average size of 28KB [[7]]. That works out to 179MB a day -- plenty of room for Reddit's 6MBs.

As of EIP-2028 [[8]], that would cost 16 gas per non-zero byte or around 96,000,000 gas a day. A reasonable gas price right now is 22 gwei [[9]], which would come out to 2.112 ether a day. At the current exchange rate of $231 [[10]], that would be approximately $488 a day spent submitting data on-chain. We're simplifying things by not taking into account the intrinsic cost of a transaction [[11]] or any execution in the EVM that will occur, but $500 a day is a reasonable estimate.

A major improvement to this would be batching the signatures together. Unfortunately, the current ECDSA signature scheme that Ethereum uses is not amenable to batching [[12]]. However, BLS [[13]] can prove n signatures in constant time and the specific curve, BLS12-381, has been implemented as part of EIP-2357 [[14]] and has been accepted into the Berlin network upgrade of Ethereum. If we recalculate the daily cost, replacing the tx size with 34 bytes, it would only cost 0.704 ether per day to post all the Community Points txs on-chain.

Some implementations of ORUs that are at varying degrees of production-ready:

There are some open questions from our side to see to which extent payment channels might be a solution to the stated problem. In other words, we are trying to understand which parts of the existing Community points system can be tweaked to suit your intention and better fit our solution.  

**General questions:** Can you elaborate on the problem Reddit wants to solve? Why do you want a tokenized solution after all?  

* Does Reddit want to transfer site governance to token holders? Or  
* Does Reddit hope financial incentives will increase user engagement? OR
* Should the token solve accountability problems (users can ""prove"" they did some paid site interaction, Reddit can't slash users funds)? OR
* Does Reddit want to experiment with blockchain tech? 

**Detailed questions:** 

* Do you have any numbers about what percentage of users are online at the same time? Can we assume for the demo that all users are online if we provide an outlook for a solution with offline users?  
* What are the balance transparency requirements? Is it necessary to know each user's balance? At any point in time? At some point in time?  
* What is the (economic) incentive of burning for subscriptions? Scarcity of the token? Transparent record of subscription?  
* Can Community Points of a different subreddit be used for a subscription?  
* Is there an easy ""duck test"" for understanding which interactions need to be decentralized / can't be decentralized? I.e. For Coin Voting, you imply that only ""distributed"" tokens can be used for voting.  
* Tipping: what are the finality requirements of sending/receiving a tip? Is a ""pending tip"" acceptable? For how long?  
* Payment Channels scale linearly but they face problems of liquidity in the network. Would Reddit be willing to support the liquidity of the network, e.g. by operating dedicated nodes in a decentralized network? Would Reddit subsidize 3rd parties for supplying liquidity?  
* Is the one-ERC20 per subreddit model set in stone? If there was only one CommunityPoint token, we could see benefits from network effects for payment channels",positive,0.92819154,10

The Raiden team here!

When we heard that Reddit is looking into scaling solutions for their Subreddit tokens we were hyped: The bake-off came just at the right time for us. We just released our second major mainnet iteration, Alderaan. After that, it was a very welcome relief to “make the impossible possible” and learn about architecture / protocol problems that are new to us.

While some of the requirements that Reddit posted don’t fit the constraints of Raiden exactly, we pulled some neat tricks out of our sleeves to move most actions off-chain and therefore make them faster and cheaper. We call our PoC Raiddit.

There are three main problems that we solved during the competition:

* Minting and distribution of community tokens
* Transfer of community tokens
* Burning of community tokens in exchange for subscriptions

As a reminder: Raiden and Raiddit are payment channel networks, which enables near-instant, low-fee and scalable payments on top of the Ethereum blockchain. This means two partners can open a payment channel and transfer tokens over it without being limited by the blockchain. So in theory, Raiddit scales linearly.

**Minting and Distribution**

Claims are used as channel deposit in Raiddit before community points are even minted on-chain. If users want to exit, the net balance is minted.

These claims can be generated really quickly and each Raiddit node can read them and join the network in a couple of seconds. Until a user wants to exit, they don’t need to spend any gas.

The step to mint and transfer tokens into a Layer 2 (L2) system can be completely avoided if the L2 system accepts such claims as a deposit itself. Raiddit does just that. A claim is equivalent to a channel deposit in the Raiden Network. This means that any user can start using Raiddit upon receiving the claim.

[https://soon.raiden.network/img/raiddit\_1.jpg](https://soon.raiden.network/img/raiddit_1.jpg)

In order to prevent double-spending, the claim is bound to a specific partner and only valid for this particular payment channel. It is equivalent to a deposit to a Raiden Network smart contract. Since there are no tokens minted yet, this kind of channel is called a “virtual channel”.

**Transfers of Community Tokens**

Once these virtual channels are created the users can send tokens to each other quickly. In our demo, we do 5k transfers in about 6 minutes being a magnitude faster than the required 100k transfers / 5 days. However, having more nodes scales the network and the transaction throughput linearly. A payment channel network - having instant finality and local consensus - is designed for doing a lot of transfers.

[https://soon.raiden.network/img/raiddit\_2.jpg](https://soon.raiden.network/img/raiddit_2.jpg)

**Burning of community tokens in exchange for subscriptions**

Token burns are a different problem that requires an efficient solution. As burning is used to get subscriptions it should not touch the blockchain ideally.

We came up with an off-chain solution to burn tokens: Burnt tokens do not get minted in the first place, they get subtracted by the claim to be submitted to the blockchain once a channel is closed.

This off-chain burning mechanism allows a user to pay for subscriptions from within a payment channel. In order to burn tokens, both participants need to sign a burn commitment containing the information of community points burnt. Both participants need to sign this commitment, since these points/tokens get subtracted from the burning party’s balance. The burn commitment is sent to Reddit and can at a later stage be used to enforce burning the tokens on-chain.

[https://soon.raiden.network/img/raiddit\_3.jpg](https://soon.raiden.network/img/raiddit_3.jpg)

**See how our PoC performs!**

In this demo we show all the above actions on several live Raiddit nodes.

[https://youtu.be/402U0CVrjyE](https://youtu.be/402U0CVrjyE)

You see a tool that we use for integration testing. It runs a sequence of tasks. The nodes here have already loaded the claims off a network. The topology is shown on the right.

We start with some token transfers sequentially. This doesn’t reach the throughput limits of the system. When running some transfers in parallel, we see that the throughput increases. Once we start more independent routes on the network we see another jump in the network's throughput.

6773,2020-06-21,"Hi, zkSYNC should be able to do this. It is a zkrollup implementation. I am not representing any team, and zkSYNC has no bullshit token associated with it (but who knows if they do in the future). I just gravitate towards things that are easier to advocate for.

https://zksync.io/

I think the primary approach is making layer2 a first class citizen, instead of ""layer2"". In this case, you - the issuer - would move the entire issuance of tokens to layer2, inside of a zksync. You do one transaction there to have a large balance available for issuance.

And then you do your issuance to addresses there. Users don't have to do an onchain transaction to get into the zkSYNC.

There are also no onchain gas costs for users, and transaction fees to incentivize the validators can be paid in the token.

If you built the primary ecosystem in this layer2 as well, then users wouldn't need to withdraw - onchain - from the zksync.

Matterlabs Inc. (zksync deployers) suggests zkSYNC can do 2,000 TPS, which means that a zksync block that used as much gas as a layer1 ethereum block, could contain 15,000 transactions. I don't know if a ""transaction"" means ""operation"" or ""transfer"". This distinction is important because an ""operation"" can likely contain many transfers, along with other actions.

Regarding costs, this would come down to the settlement transactions onchain. so I am guessing a few hundred dollars per block (.4 - .8 ether) if you filled up an entire block and paid more for it to bump make miners deprioritize all other transactions, but it is likely that relayers subsidize this, or it can be subsidized. After the initial distribution, the users would just play with it themselves and no costs to you.",positive,0.9241638,10

7026,2021-06-06,"In my honest opinion, nobody actually likes BTC because it's a ""good store of value"". That's just a narrative veneer about value that is less degenerate than the naked admission that it's a volatile investment vehicle that has significantly appreciated in fiat terms (over a long enough time horizon), and the majority of early adopters have made absurd returns on it. It deserves to be loved because it's an amazing idea, and one that has worked well enough to spawn interest and excitement and investment in the overall space, which I think has moral and technological value. That said, I think its scalability limitations are also obvious, and these limit the long-term utility and (what I perceive to be the) original aspirations of the community around payments/adoption as a fiat alternative, which has caused the narrative to shift to this ""store of value"" claim, which seems dubious.

It does not really appear clear to me that in a world where Bitcoin becomes ""less exciting"", or loses its status as the brand leader of the crypto space, that it's inherently any different than something like Bitcoin Cash. And really, what needs to happen for that to occur? A year or two of negative returns coupled with another exciting crypto asset, whatever that happens to be?

The value proposition of ETH is that a secure, scalable, decentralized, trustless EVM has intrinsic utility in a large number of use cases that align well with the macro trend of US fintech adoption and innovation, but also map onto current social issues around technology and censorship. It also may enable a new paradigm of digital asset ownership (digital goods become more comparable to physical goods, and can be easily sold and traded by default) and web application design that shifts back toward users directly paying for goods and services, and away from their data being commodified in exchange for services. These trends and concepts are likely to attract significant institutional interest and capital (first from financials, who are deathly afraid of getting disintermediated in spaces they dominate), not to mention development talent, since Ethereum is.. well, useful and flexible and powerful, *provided the economics of transactions permit usability*.

At the end of the day, ETH seems more akin to a share of a (nascent) company, in the sense that any returns of the utility that the network develops will increasingly accrue to the owners (via staking yield for participation in processing transactions, deflation of the supply), but the more interesting (and plausible) aspect is that this doesn't really require ""mass adoption"", or consumer recognition, of ETH as a currency-replacement to occur, as the network can and does get ""used"" in lots of ways without users necessarily knowingly spending ETH. 

The seemingly more-likely medium-term path is that people unwittingly transition to ""crypto nativity"" via fiat stablecoins at traditional banking and payments institutions, and rarely interact with weirdly-named internet-currencies. In their minds, they still earn USD, they still spend USD on their credit cards, but perhaps there are fewer network outages, and wire transfers go faster, and cost less, because, in reality, they're using crypto payments rails.

Similarly, games could leverage NFTs to allow players to have true custody of digital assets, but not necessarily denominate any transactions in ETH, and simply choose to handle the financial bridge between some USD stablecoin their payments provider uses and ETH themselves on the backend.

Perhaps some neobanks ​will allow consumers to earn much higher interest rates on their deposits, by wrapping some of the more complex financial products available in DeFi in a UX that basically amounts to ""Earn 4% APR on your savings!"" ​Maybe a company like Coinbase uses their IPO war-chest to apply for a traditional banking license, and does this.

In the world where ETH successfully scales, as it looks increasingly like it will, it's essentially like holding shares of ""the internet"", or ""the global payments settlement system"", or both.

So yeah, I don't know that ETH is supposed to ""replace Bitcoin"". I think it will likely realize part of the original aspiration of Bitcoin, to be used in payments, but probably not frequently as the currency in which the payments are denominated. BTC is certainly a profound, transformational, invention, but I don't know that it will have tremendous ongoing value (say, over the 10 year time horizon). It will certainly have value as long as the brand continues to have clout that is backed by convicted investment, but I personally don't have much conviction, and I don't see a catalyst for investment, beyond perhaps an influx of retail capital from ETFs or the like.",positive,0.7686383,31

In my mind BTC is the Wright Flyer, a revolutionary, species defining, invention. Unfortunately for it though, it exists in a time that moves much faster than things did back then. So while it was a revolution, and an evolution for our species, a thousand projects of ""similar merit"" have popped up with the advantage of knowing everything and more that was learnt from Bitcoin.

There is still a lot to unfold to this story, so I honestly wouldn't count on any of the current market leaders to solidify that position.

I also think it's beneficial to look at these things as networks instead of as dollars or gold. When you approach it this way BTC really shows its age. Even ETH 2.0 ends up being behind the curve. Being the biggest fastest, most useful network isn't everything, but I think it's going to matter.

One more thing I want to add is in regards to store's of value in general. Even the big institutions like Goldman-Sachs don't seem to be able to fully appreciate how they work. Store's of value undergo massive generational shifts. Fine wine is a good example of this, as you'll see they are included by many as being a store of value. Millennials though don't give a fuck about fine wine, and we know none of you can tell the difference. I wouldn't put my money in wine. I also won't be putting any money into Bitcoin. A good store of value has good utility, and these utility requirements tend to shift with the times.",positive,0.89521295,57

Yes Bitcoin has first mover advantage and is the most known but the world moves on, so does Ethereum, Cardano and almost every other cryptocurrency, besides Bitcoin (or extremly slow). Ethereum's fees were a killer for me since I didn't want to pay $50 to send $10. But Bitcoin even tops that and it has no actual plan (besides LN) to handle this.

7040,2021-06-06,"I personally feel like there's a very strong argument to make on why bitcoin is a better store of value, but why eth will probably vastly outperform bitcoin as an investment. I'm 50/50 on them portfolio wise. ETH has a more obvious use case, but it's like an infrastructure product / gas for the web 3.0. If the web 3.0 apps keep gaining traction and keep using ETH, owning a piece of that will make you a lot of money. Downside: Since most of this is not about ETH as a brand but rather about it's functionality as gas for the network, it might get replaced by a different web 3.0 currency down the line if it ends up being faster, cheaper, less centralised etc? Not based on any research, just a noob's objections. Whereas bitcoin is not really a infrastructure/behind the scenes product but rather a store of value **brand** where the transaction times matter less. If your main objective is to take back the monetary system from the central banks and decentralise it, Bitcoin is a more obvious choice with it being a capped supply and a currency that's not controllable by anyone. No country would allow ETH to become a legal tender currency because they'd be giving away control to a foreign organisation. So imo: BTC has an actual shot at becoming the world currency, ETH has a shot to be like Amazon, and you're investing in it in it's infancy. Apples and pears.   


There's never gonna be a 'better' bitcoin because of the way how it was founded: it's almost impossible to create a crypto currency now where there's no large owners or corporations involved in the start, no people owning a HUGE chunk of the supply etc because there's so much money involved. Bitcoin had a few years to mature and fate has given it the perfect start for an actual decentralised currency, down to Satoshi as being this unknown figure. Every currency will have a founder who'll have had the chance to pre-mine or secure a large part of the supply for himself. Obviously the hard supply cap is also unique compared to ETH for example. 

I think my ETH investment will outperform my BTC investment massively. Just different use cases like you said. I don't understand the hatred either, but I think it's rooted in people believing BTC/ETH to be 'the same thing'.

* Energy consumption woes- even if it's somehow made to use all green energy, it's still a massive amount of electricity to use for something that doesn't strictly need to use that much power. This also contributes to centralization- only larger mining firms can afford the capital investment needed to start significant mining. 
* Powered by narrative- people invest in bitcoin because over the last 10 years its value has exploded and there has basically been no better investment to buy. What if that weren't the case anymore? What if ETH or a similar chain flips BTC and also offers significant ROI from staking? Will people still want to buy BTC? 
* Mining economics- Bitcoin miners tend to have fairly tight margins, and many even operate in the negative. If the price of bitcoin can't keep up with halvings and other costs of running miners, what happens to the hash power behind BTC? 

Perhaps these won't turn out to be problems at all, but I think there's a significant amount of risk in the not-so-distant future for Bitcoin, much of it related to the intransigence of the dev community with regard to power consumption.",positive,0.81489164,2

Statement by President Joe Biden on Cybersecurity Awareness Month
OCTOBER 01, 2021
STATEMENTS AND RELEASES
Cyber threats can affect every American, every business regardless of size, and every community. That’s why my administration is marshalling a whole-of-nation effort to confront cyber threats.

I am committed to strengthening our cybersecurity by hardening our critical infrastructure against cyberattacks, disrupting ransomware networks, working to establish and promote clear rules of the road for all nations in cyberspace, and making clear we will hold accountable those that threaten our security. In May, I issued an executive order to modernize our defenses and position the Federal government to lead, rather than lag, in its own cybersecurity. By using the power of Federal technology spending, we are improving the software available for use to all Americans. Our 100-day action plan to improve cybersecurity across the electricity sector has already resulted in more than 150 utilities serving 90 million Americans committing to deploy cybersecurity technologies, and we are working to deploy action plans for additional critical infrastructure sectors. Both the public and private sectors have a role to play in strengthening cybersecurity, which is why we also issued a National Security Memorandum outlining the cybersecurity practices that responsible owners and operators of critical infrastructure should put in place and brought together leading American executives to expand public-private cooperation on cybersecurity.

We are also partnering closely with nations around the world on these shared threats, including our NATO allies and G7 partners. This month, the United States will bring together 30 countries to accelerate our cooperation in combatting cybercrime, improving law enforcement collaboration, stemming the illicit use of cryptocurrency, and engaging on these issues diplomatically. We are building a coalition of nations to advocate for and invest in trusted 5G technology and to better secure our supply chains. And, we are bringing the full strength of our capabilities to disrupt malicious cyber activity, including managing both the risks and opportunities of emerging technologies like quantum computing and artificial intelligence. The Federal government needs the partnership of every American and every American company in these efforts. We must lock our digital doors — by encrypting our data and using multifactor authentication, for example—and we must build technology securely by design, enabling consumers to understand the risks in the technologies they buy. Because people – from those who build technology to those to deploy technology – are at the heart of our success.

This October, even as we recognize how much work remains to be done and that maintaining strong cybersecurity practices is ongoing work, I am confident that the advancements we have put in place during the first months of my Administration will enable us to build back better – modernizing our defenses and securing the technology on which our enduring prosperity and our security rely.",positive,0.68634784,4

This argument is obviously wrong because public transportation systems are actually some of the cleanest and most efficient transportation systems we have. If you shut down all the public transit people would switch back to driving which consumes MUCH more energy and because a lot of that is not clean energy is MUCH MUCH worse for the environment.  
  
So it's not sufficient to just say that something uses a lot of electricity. You have to look at how much electricity it uses compared to other options. ask yourself ""how much electricity does the banking industry use worldwide"".  
  
We can't transmit energy around the world for free. We also can't transmit gold or any other store of value around the world for free.

**1. Call your Senators:**  
One of the easiest options is **automated call** (need to have 'silence/block' of unknown callers disabled or use landline) - in **2-5min** you can call both your senators and talk to staff or leave a voicemail - some say over the last hours the tool is sometimes unreachable and voicemails are full, but most users confirm the tool still works and most were able to at least leave voicemails:

**2. Email or contact your senator through official government contact info:**   
Either you can use an automated email tool that Coinbase had setup - takes less than 1min :

If you just want to copy&paste good language in your email instead of writing it yourself this text was suggested by the coinbase tool: 

  
*""Dear Senator,*   
*The Wyden-Lummis-Toomey amendment is the only amendment that actually is a compromise.  The Warner amendment is anti-technology and anti-innovation.*  
*A vote for the Warner amendment would be irresponsible and dangerous to America’s national security.*  
*Any narrative that this is a compromise on the Wyden-Lummis-Toomey amendment is false. This Warner amendment does not address the shortcomings of the bill. The Warner amendment is worse than the existing text of the bill.*   
*Without any consideration or explanation, it picks one crypto protocol and condemns others to be crushed under impossible burdens. The United States has succeeded in becoming a leader in innovation because it regulates activities, not specific technologies, and it does so neutrally. It is one thing to regulate (or exempt from regulation) distributed ledger validators, but it is wholly another to pick one winner among different types of validation technologies.*  
*Sen. Warner’s amendment would kill Ethereum and other proof-of-stake protocols. Ethereum is the leading smart-contract platform on the internet that enables countless use cases that provide cheaper, more inclusive services to Americans. It’s like killing the World Wide Web in its infancy.*  
*Sen. Warner’s amendment would drive away all innovation to outside of the United States. By favoring proof-of-work (the oldest consensus method) in statute, Sen. Warner’s amendment locks the U.S. into one technology. This is like picking which of the early protocols would form the backbone of the Internet. Proof of work was the first validation method invented; that doesn’t mean that it is the one that will be most useful/successful. Why should the IRS put its thumb on the scale?*  
*US leadership in digital finance is critical to America’s future and our leadership over China. Removing protections for software developers in the Wyden-Lummis-Toomey amendment is a direct push to have crypto development and innovation take place outside the US.""*",positive,0.84890103,2

It's a [known effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_demand#Induced_traffic_and_transport_planning) that you can't fight traffic by building new roads (or even tunnels), it just gets more people to drive. It's called induced demand.

Ideally most users should not be required to use L1 at all. This will be much more significant looking forward compared to all the scaling measures. Of course we need to do all the scaling measures regardless just manage your expectations.

8321,2021-12-04,I believe if satoshi meant to spend his coins he would do so. My personal theory is that satoshi is dead or lost interest in the Bitcoin project because people saw it as a means to make money and not decentralise banks and make the world a better place.,positive,0.58172697,16

8325,2021-12-04,"I would be way more concerned with Vitalik dumping because that would mean he is acting on  inside information like, for example, the SEC ruling that the ethereum ICO was a sale of an unregistered security, and they were coming after every ICO company ever made

Or that there was something catastrophically wrong with the protocol 

Or that he got hacked which wouldn’t be great either as they’d probably roll back the chain again 

Satoshi moving his coins is something that everyone knew could be possible, it would negatively impact the price as there would be way more circulating supply than people had thought, but it wouldn’t be an indictment on the protocol itself.

8330,2021-12-04,It's very possible Satoshi died and that's the reason he never sold any or even moved them around. If that's the case that would mean bitcoin is more scarce as a lot of wallets are lost or inaccessible.,neutral,0.7893572,2

8332,2021-12-04,"Plus, as Satoshi’s coins are sitting in a ‘used’ address, they’re vulnerable to a quantum attack. It will take 10-15 years from now, but those coins will move again. And that will impact the market soooo hard. 

It’s fun to fantasize about the scenarios, like will there be a soft fork to prevent these coins to be sent? (Unlikely) or will there be a whitehat attack to burn the coins? 

One thing is certain, these coins will move again at some point.

>I vehemently oppose all regulatory efforts made by the US Government targeting cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies. How arrogant of you to enact crippling regulations on a technology so new you can barely explain what it is? US Regulations only serve to cripple innovations in this sector and must inevitably lead to our exclusion from the competition entirely.   
Thie ""America Competes Act"" proposition will allow a sole individual to ban exchanges and other financial institutions from engaging in cryptocurrency transactions. The individual that could potentially hold these unchecked powers is none other than the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen. The very individual who has be opposed of the crypto market since her confirmation, this is also the same individual who had the brilliant idea to look into bank accounts for possible tax evasion.  
It doesn't just stop there, this would allow Yellen to employ what is called the "" Bank Secrecy Act"" to require certain financial institutions to report information around transactions potentially connected to money laundering, as well as prohibit them from serving account holders with such alleged ties to illicit funds. While the act isn’t something new it would go against the essence of what Defi stands for. While on paper this can be limited to those are under suspicion of money laundering and illicit fund activity we all know how quick this can be used to cover more users and account holders. This can be dangerous considering Yellen would have unilateral power over this sector.  
Crypto means something different to every individual in communities like r/ethereum to some a hedge against the current inflation, a means to increase personal wealth, monetary freedom and anonymity, whatever the reason is we are all in this together.  
This is either a bad joke or a deliberate attempt by the government to weaponize financial institutions against the American people. At this point in the current administration I can only conclude the latter is true.",positive,0.7144343,2

8485,2021-09-12,"Great to see this finally getting some traction in the crypto space! I think everyone in the crypto space should make some effort to grasp what has been going on around GME and what people have exposed..... the cross overs with the crypto space are multiple and exciting! 

First things first, I am 100% invested in crypto! I did not (until very recently) have a single investment outside of crypto, all my saving and spare money goes straight into crypto as fast as I can transfer it! So I came to this from a crypto perspective and STILL have that same perspective! 

And what I have come across is AMAZING from a crypto perspective! 

I'll give a VERY basic overview of GameStop's possible plans around utilising NFT technology but encourage anyone that even has a passing interest to head over to the Superstonk sub and check out the link near the bottom of my comment.  

There are 3 leading theories around this (go check out the Superstonk sub for more in depth discussions). 

1 - NFT based marketplace tied to digital games. The NFT is the vehicle that has ownership of the digital copy of the game. That NFT can then be traded/sold and the ownership of the game transfers with it. This would fit perfectly with GameStops existing business model of being a marketplace for 2nd hand physical games.... just moving that business model into the digital era. Also opens up a GameStop marketplace for other ""in game"" objects. (this theory for me is highly likely) 

....................

The following 2 are more tied to the $GME share saga. If you don't know about this its WELL worth your time to head over to the above mentioned sub and read some of the fantastic research many people have put together..... because it has some MAJOR cross-overs with crypto (I was 100% in crypto, zero traditional shares or investments and I started seeing repeating patterns in crypto markets that sent me search for an explanation..... that lead me to the above mentioned sub and some pretty big eye openers about hedge funds and their already substantial investments PRIVATELY in the crypto space. More on that later) 

....................

2 - NFT based dividend. Unsure what form this will take but its an idea being floated a lot and it ties back to the failure of the DTCC and their failure to maintain the integrity of the share issuance for GameStop and stopping the illegal creation of synthetic shares used to sell short the company.

 Usually what has happened in the past when a company has been naked shorted and the company issue's a dividend, they only issue if for the actual float of shares the company has issued. So let's say there is 100 shares in total and the company pays a $1 dividend so the company issues $100 in total. Now, in this example hedgies have been bad and participated in the practice of naked shorting. They have created a further 400 synthetic shares that have been sold into the market and if the dividend isn't paid to those 400 share holders..... then the scam will be exposed! So all they have traditionally done is pay the $1 dividend themselves and no one is any the wiser. Because its fiat, they can ""counterfeit"" the dividend with zero troubles. 

This is were a NFT based dividend is a game changer. It can't be counterfeited as its on the blockchain. Only 100 NFT's for the 100 shares for the companies share float would be issued by the company. That then puts the hedgies in the position that they can't counterfeit the dividend and will be exposed for their illegal naked shorting. 

GameStop doing this is a possibility..... 

3 - NFT based share issue. This I think is GameStop's CEO's ultimate goal. The existing DTCC system has proven itself 100% corrupted repeatedly with 1000's of public companies and their shares. When the GME naked shorting finally gets exposed wide spread its going to cause a complete loss of trust in any sort of perceived integrity in the current DTCC system. This might happen immediately when GME blows up but I'm betting it will take a little longer to seep through all markets and market participants. Regardless, what's going on in GME is going to be the catalyst for the existing share trading system to loose ALL integrity in the eyes of market participants. 

This is where NFT based shares come into play. Each share is by its nature already unique. Every share issued by a company has a unique share number. The problem has been the system they used for digital share trading is easy to circumvent and create ""synthetic"" shares (counterfeit) and then hide that criminality. 

But with BLOCKCHAIN, that changes the WHOLE landscape! 

So each unique share will be ""owned"" by a unique NFT which will act as the vehicle to carry that share ownership. Each NFT transaction is then recorded on the blockchain creating a immutable record of when it was bought and sold, who owns it and most importantly how many in TOTAL exist at any point in time! 

This is GAME CHANGING! If GME successfully do this, it will create an entire new system of share issuance and share trading that is secure, fair and TRUSTLESS! Companies world wide will be desperate to issue their shares in this way and it will fundamentally change the way shares are traded! 

This is blockchain tech being implemented at the HEART of the entire financial system! Not waiting another 10yrs, not hoping to get mainstream adoption sometime in the future..... If this happens, BLOCKCHAIN WILL BE MAINSTREAM! That opens the door WIDE open for the crypto space! 

If GME plays out like its certainly looking like its going to play out, we might be looking at the catalyst that triggers the whole world to transition rapidly to blockchain based technologies!  

For those interested, someone compiled a library of all the research MANY people have done around this issue and it is an informative read. Even if you have ZERO interest in traditional markets and shares, the cross overs with the crypto space are IMO important and valuable to grasp...

I didn't sell any of my crypto but I did take some fiat and bought some GME shares and then Direct Registered those shares with ComputerShare which forces REAL shares to be located in the DTCC system and taken out which really fucks the criminal naked shorts! 

I really think this thing needs to be spread far and wide in the crypto space! It is tied into crypto already in multiple ways and I think its largely being ignored. I hope some of you spend the time to sift through it and if you see the same things I see, please spread the word! This is potentially a major catalyst for the entire crypto space!

TL;DR - Go back and read it, its something we all need to at least know about. But if not - Rampant criminality in the existing financial markets is about to be exposed, NFT and Blockchain technology is going to be the game changer!

The extra 5 MH/s for the Series X GPU comes from the extra 48 GB/s memory bandwidth it has over the stock RX 6800. 

Series S should be able to pull off 28 MH/s once fully optimized. GPU in the Series S is about as powerful as a Radeon RX 5500XT, except RDNA2 instead of RDNA. Both have the same memory bandwidth of 224GB/s. 5500XT gets 28 MH/s in Ethash

As I believe a few other people have pointed out in this thread, Russia is likely doing this to skirt around economic sanctions. Both ones that would be triggered from a potential invasion of Ukraine but also the ones they have still been struggling under from the 2014 Magnitsky Act.

Once it is clear that is what they are doing, governments aren't going to say ""Oh, gee. Guess we didn't consider crypto with those sanctions. Guess ol' Russia outsmarted us.""

8637,2022-02-15,"Apologies for hijacking the top comment here, just wanted to share some tools and resources that users discussing this topic should really be familiar with. We know that misinformation, online disinformation campaigns and other active measures [1](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/07/magazine/the-agency.html) have formed a key component of Putin's strategy in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine [2](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2020/11/12/the-grus-mh17-disinformation-operations-part-1-the-bonanza-media-project/) [3](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2018/01/05/kremlins-shifting-self-contradicting-narratives-mh17/), elsewhere in Eastern Europe [4](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/holgerroonemaa/russia-propaganda-baltics-baltnews) [5](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/02/18/reconstruction-full-incredible-story-behind-russias-deadly-plot/) and around the world [6](https://medium.com/@ushadrons) [7](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/tech/2018/05/10/thousands-russian-bought-facebook-social-media-ads-released-congress/849959001/) and as such I strongly believe that it is important to equip you with the ability to at least have a chance of identifying and avoiding this kind of manipulation.


There are a variety of subreddits devoted to recording and studying this such as r/ActiveMeasures, r/Disinfo and the sub that I'm part of - r/trollfare. We've gathered a collection of resources on our [wiki](https://old.reddit.com/r/trollfare/wiki/index), the most relevant of which relate to how trolls, bad faith actors and Active Measures agents will try to control and steer an online discussion [8](https://pastebin.com/raw/irj4Fyd5) [9](https://medium.com/s/story/a-field-guide-to-bad-faith-arguments-7-terrible-arguments-in-your-mentions-ee4f194afbc9) [10](http://www.iftf.org/fileadmin/user_upload/images/DigIntel/SR-2002_IFTF_Biology_of_disinformation_tk_042618.pdf).


And here are some user analysis tools that you can use to check on suspicious accounts:


* https://reddit-user-analyser.netlify.app/ is the simplest and fastest user analysis tool that I know of. It provides a list of the top 100 subreddits a user has posted in and their most commonly used 100 words, excluding articles (the/a) and prepositions (in/on/etc.) I think. There are also graphs of their comments and submissions by date. You can use this information to identify users who bolster their reputation in karma farming subs like 'freekarma4you' as well as commonly upvoted subs like 'aww', 'pics', or any popular sports teams. There is obviously nothing wrong with someone posting on sites like that in general, but if an account only posted replies like ""cute bunny"" or ""go ManU!"" for years and then suddenly start spouting exclusively kremilin talking points then you might have reason for suspicion! 


* https://redditmetis.com/ - Is another site that analyzes a user, similar to reddit-user-analyser but in addition to displaying where and when they post and get karma it also will actually use their posts to extract information they have stated about themselves such as their employment, nationality etc. This shouldn't be taken as reliable as not only can it make mistakes but it also has no way of knowing if a user has lied. Some information has a # link next to it which leads you to the comment from which the information was extracted, this lets you consider context and judge it's veracity for yourself. Another great feature of redditmetis is the activity heatmap, showing when in the day a user posts. If they claim to be from Canada but they only post in working hours Moscow time then that may raise a red flag...


* https://www.redditinvestigator.com/ - Similar to the first two however much slower to generate the analysis. I'd suggest giving it a try, although I use it much less than the others. The one unique feature is that it extracts the website links used in submissions to show you if the user frequently links to certain sites. In the context of this conflict look for sites like RT (Russia Today) and Sputniknews being shared a lot.


* https://camas.github.io/reddit-search/ - This site lets you search all comments a user has made on a certain sub, within a certain timeframe and/or including keywords. If you wanted to find all the posts made by account X in the sub Y that included the term Z you could do so. 


* https://redditcommentsearch.com/ - Does similar to the above but with less search options. No fields to limit date range for example, but otherwise perfectly useful. Sometimes simplicity is good.


* https://www.unddit.com/ - Allows you to view deleted comments from discussions, assuming that the comments wasn't removed too quickly. You'll often see users arguing in what appears to be bad faith, spreading disinformation, then when someone disproves their bullshit or calls them out the bad-faith user may delete their comments, so when they try something similar again no-one can see that they shouldn't be trusted. This site provides you with a counter to these reputation management techniques, allowing you to view and share evidence of previous manipulation attempts that the user may think they have scrubbed from the record.


* https://subredditstats.com/subreddit-user-overlaps - You can use this site to compare subreddit userbase similarities, as a kind of meta analysis of what you're doing by just checking profiles and useful if you see a subreddit that you don't recognize or start to see a pattern with lots of accounts posting in a certain sub.


I hope that this lot is helpful, we're entering a period where I'm expecting disinfo here to really ramp-up, hopefully by working together we can counter it to a certain extent. Please, please copy and paste this comment wherever you like, especially when you see threads with suspicious accounts. Don't call them out directly as this may get you banned in some subs, and don't reply to them even to argue as the primary role maybe just to derail discussion and therefore crack a consensus that is forming. Instead just post this in reply to the person they are interacting with, or just wherever you like really.

Thank you so much for your time, I appreciate that this isn't directly on topic for this sub, and I really appreciate you taking the threat of misinformation and manipulation seriously enough to read through this lot.",positive,0.9123442,8

8647,2021-04-25,"I think tax implications are a legitimate reason people would rather just keep their funds on an exchange if they have any intention of selling in the future.

Automated crypto tax calculators usually just look at transactions on exchanges right, not what you do with your personal wallet? I know the one I used counted an eth withdrawal from the exchange to my personal wallet as a ""sell"" by default and tranfering it back to the exchange as a ""buy"". So if you withdraw your eth, do a bunch of yield farming, augur betting, staking, etc, and then send back to the exchange to sell, you've massively complicated your tax calculations, and automated services are likely to get it wrong when importing transactions. 

With small amounts, you might not think it would be enough for th IRS to care or notice, but if ETH moons a lot, thinking long term here like 5-10+ years, even small errors in cost basis for your capital gains might be enough to warrant an audit.

As long as everything you do with your cryptocurrency legally counts as a taxable event, that's enough friction and cause for worry that a lot of people would rather just buy, hold, and then sell in order to keep their tax calculations and liability as small as possible.

>Lend, borrow, swap, & do much more with them!

Lending and borrowing are not possible with smart contracts alone, they are made possible thanks to oracle networks which bring off-chain data to the blockchain. For example, there must be an oracle to provide the price of 1 ETH in USDC, so the application knows how much you can borrow and knows when to liquidate you. Without oracles there's no Aave or Compound.

Now about swapping, it doesn't require oracles because the prices are determined by the ratios in the liquidity pools, so if there's a pair made of 10k USDC and 1 ETH, that'll be the price of ETH in USDC.",positive,0.93539435,2

I've likely been invested in Ethereum years before most of you guys and I still am, but this project is starting to get dull. That's just my opinion. It's quickly becoming an uninspiring blockchain.

I'm dying to have intelligent debates with people in here, but the tribalism leads to all my comments getting instantly buried. Sure, Ethereum was once groundbreaking, but I'd argue that is no longer the case. Such a comment (anything remotely negative) will get me downvoted into oblivion. Please read further and consider my thoughts. I am very willing to listen to your arguments. I am not a maximalist.

4-5 years ago Ethereum devs were slamming all the new 3rd gen chains with FUD and claiming they had no idea what they were doing. According to the devs, Ethereum was on track and no one would be able to compete. Scaling Ethereum was going to get solved eventually (empty promise) and there was no Ethereum 2 plan. The devs have given up on the existing codebase and opted to build an entirely new blockchain built from scratch...

They are now copying the 3rd gen projects. Despite having an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) that will eventually store the state of Ethereum, for purposes of running legacy Ethereum smart contracts, Ethereum 2 has nothing to do with Ethereum. You might as well use any other new blockchain with an EVM, since that one has likely already has proven scalability and a flourishing ecosystem. You might even catch the next big thing.

Point is, Vitalik was obviously wrong and doesn't want to admit that. They are pivoting 180 degrees and trying to make it seem as though this was the plan all along. They are calling it a ""simple upgrade"" when it isn't even an upgrade, but rather a completely new blockchain marketed as something else. Investing in Ethereum now is not the same as investing in it 5 years ago.

1. Ethereum is dead, Ethereum 2 is proof of that.
2. Ethereum 2 is another (potentially empty) promise
3. Ethereum 2 is unproven technology and things can go wrong.
4. Where not unproven technology, it's just copying from other projects.
5. It's not an investment into anything groundbreaking.
6. It's not investing into a first-mover with no competition.
7. The price of Ethereum is likely going to tank if Ethereum 2 succeeds.
8. If Ethereum 2 fails then prices of both are likely going to tank.

It's risky. Ethereum 2 is made for dApps, whereas Ethereum was made for smart contracts. Vitalik knows where the future (money) is and he's willing to uproot every single Eth holder with this gamble so that he can access this new market and maintain the value of his holdings.

Why is it uninspiring? Look at the roadmap. It's nothing new. Headlines like ""Ethereum to Reduce Energy Consumption by 99.95 Percent"" are idiotic and mislead people into thinking Ethereum is still ahead of the curve when it hasn't been for years. The current energy consumption of Ethereum is 49 Tera-Watt-Hour (TWh). 0.05% of that is 0.0245 TWh. This is what they are aiming to achieve... this is supposed to be inspiring. Well, it's not. Telos is currently only using  0.0004 TWh per year, despite Telos having 564% more activity than Ethereum.  Telos is using -98.36% less energy than the Ethereum 2 roadmap is aiming for. A lot of other chains are also beating Ethereum and roadmaps are supposed to be exciting.

Please prove me wrong. I am considering moving my current holdings into a stable coin until I have further examined the market.",positive,0.8108895,3

The activities of these hedgefunds are completely unregulated and I am almost certain they collude illegally with each other to pump and dump. crypto  
  
Also some hedgefunds get 100x leverage on their crypto  
  
Until that changes I'm not touching crypto as an investment.  
  
Crypto is no longer a hedge against the status quo - it has been assimilated into it.

Only other downside I see to this is some kind of government action that made AWS stop serving the network. Very very unlikely, but as we saw with Parler they can act if called out. Shouldn't affect other countries but still would put the network in a bind if everyone in some country had the plug pulled at once. 

Overall I think this is good news and makes it much easier for the general public to access nodes. Not everyone has stable internet or power. So, I see this as a win.

8934,2021-10-15,"A lot of people are missing a massive selling point of NFTs - utility. Real world utility.

I own digital basketball cards that so far have gotten me access to a suite at the NBA Summer League, NBA jerseys and memorabilia, a pretty slick display that displays the NFTs on a loop, and more to come. Supposedly this is just the beginning of our perk list.

There's a food media company working with restaurants to create exclusive dine-in experiences for NFT owners.

NFTs as event tickets and memorabilia with more features make all the sense in the world. You buy some digital package and you get a bunch of cool shit in real life, PLUS something that may hold value in the collector space.

If there's utility I'm in.

I think the current social clout NFTs are what most have a problem with, and eventually they'll be seen no differently than high priced art - a lot of people don't understand that world either, myself included. People who can't afford to participate tend to have a particularly strong opinion which makes a lot of sense, it does seem like the money could be used in better ways, but I'd urge others not to judge anyone based on how they spend their money.

Blockchain technology is just a verifiable ledger, it's a new way to build and manage a database - video games will most certainly run on this technology in the future. I don't know how long it will take but digital economies tied to a blockchain solves many of the problems RMAH type systems have had in the past.

Legal issues are another story, but they'll sort themselves out over time - my guess is once there's more precedent Valve will re-evaluate their stance on ""NFT"" games. There is a ton of mobile game style cash grabs in the space right now so I have no issue with them saying no to them at this point.

I think as we transition into a digital-first economy there will be some very awkward years, especially for anyone in the 30+ age group.

It was a few months back when they opened the doors and said “ok, anyone who wants to be a staker, come on in.” With the understanding that Ethereum would need 500,000 ETH staked to provide a baseline of security.

The journey was cool, as up to a week before the deadline there was “only” 250k. Then within a day or two the rest appeared. Apparently the big institutions were waiting to make sure we would get there, then just plunked in the rest. 

Anyhow, since then more people have joined in staking. And now we’re at a bonkers 3 million eth. That’s $5 billion at today’s rates. That’s a whole lot of confidence in this system.

He said this against the backdrop of falling revenues from traditional app stores such as Google and Apple. Rhodes' prediction could also be tied to the transition of the network from proof-of-work (PoW) consensus algorithm to proof of stake.

>We can overcome the restrictive costs of GAS in small Ethereum transactions -which brakes the amazing advancements achieved in the DeFi ecosystem- by giving each registered user a token that allows to cover a portion of the GAS tariff. 

So if UBI tokens got a portion of space in each block and could be burned as gas instead of ETHER, that would give the token sustained value while being a way to make Ethereum more inclusive.

That kind of taunting is generally more within the purview of former President Donald J. Trump, whose insults are so voluminous and so often absurd that they have been cataloged by the hundreds. But lately, the barbs have been coming from President Biden, who once would only refer to Mr. Trump as “the former guy.”

Gone are the days of calling Mr. Trump “my predecessor.”

“We’ll never forget lying about Covid and telling the American people to inject bleach in their arms,” Mr. Biden said at a fund-raiser on Thursday evening, referring to Mr. Trump’s suggestion as president that Americans should try using disinfectant internally to combat the coronavirus.

“He injected it in his hair,” Mr. Biden said.

He is coming up with those lines himself: “This isn’t ‘S.N.L.,’” said James Singer, a spokesman and rapid response adviser for the Biden campaign, referring to “Saturday Night Live.” “We’re not writing jokes for him.”

The needling from Mr. Biden is designed to hit his opponent where it hurts, touching on everything from Mr. Trump’s hairstyle to his energy levels in court. Mr. Biden has also used policy arguments to get under Mr. Trump’s skin, mocking the former president’s track record on abortion, the coronavirus pandemic and the economy.

The president’s advisers say Mr. Trump’s legal problems have created an opening. As Mr. Trump faces felony charges that he falsified business records to pay off a porn actress ahead of the 2016 election, Mr. Biden and his aides have refrained from talking directly about the legal proceedings. Mr. Biden has made it a point to say he is too busy.",neutral,0.61587995,15

9401,2021-08-25,"This whole post is just incorrect fanboy nonsense. 

The world acknowledges that layer 2 solutions can help with Ethereums scalability woes. The problem is that this won’t actually help with broad adoption and anyone who says it will is naive or lying.  

At this point, no matter what anyone tries to say, crypto is still hard.  It’s hard to buy.  It’s hard to store.  It’s hard to send. It’s hard to receive.  Three smart engineers in my office and myself, an attorney, still get smoked regularly when trying to handle more complicated things.  

Everyone wants adoption, but the first mover advantage of Ethereum isn’t going to bring it.  What’s going to bring it is a cleaner, better, easier user interface for people to interact with crypto. 

Roll ups or layer 2’s or whatever else you want to try to dress up as a solution here goes in the other direction.  It complicates the user interface, adding another entire layer of difficulty for new users to try to untangle.  It might make it cheaper for tech savvy people to handle eth20 tokens, but that doesn’t solve the big issue, broader adoption. The only thing that will solve that issue is a single network with the speed to handle on chain transactions WHICH ALSO has a good and simple user interface.  

If you need proof of this concept, I would suggest looking back at IBM and Microsoft.  IBM was building good machines, but until windows came along to harness it, there really wasn’t broad traction for regular people.  

The only way Ethereum, or a combination of its layer 2’s, achieves this is if they fix the interface issue to make it easier for average people.  And for it to mean anything, it has to be BOTH simple and interoperable for all of the projects built on Ethereums network.  

So, while I like the function of a project like Polygon, it just isn’t an answer for the bigger issue.  In truth, adding complexity is likely to push new users away from the network and hurt adoption overall.  That said, if/when Eth2 launches, if it has the speed to address the transaction problem on the network, AND it’s interface provides for easy interoperability between projects, it will be well positioned to achieve this.  

Personally, I place so much significance on this issue that I’ve actually become a real cheerleader for the Harmony One project.   Crossing my fingers that they address the interface issue with the new wallet.  If they can do that, and the network can handle the transactions, they might have a very real edge in the race toward adoption. 

So yeah. People can try to make light of Eth2’s importance, but that’s a nonsense argument.",positive,0.76304847,6

ETH is going to be around forever, much like BTC. It's the scaling and the limits of solidity that will hold it back from real ""change"". That doesn't mean it can't be a great showroom for the early phase of defi. See gas costs of defi on ETH, wider spread adoption just makes things worse. Moreover, solidity is just a monster to develop in so when we're talking big money dapps they can't advance too much too fast, it's just not safe. All that said, the ecosystem is in a weird place right now where decentralization is forgotten in the pursuit of profits and things like binance chain and layer 2 solutions are accepted without much consideration. Blockchains being decentralized is core to resiliency, but decentralization is slower.  
  
Until we see defi volume on a platform that can scale without limits, so that gas costs can be kept down, crypto and defi will be more of an ""epcot like showroom"" than the ""future"".

9746,2022-01-20,"> The security model trumps the economic model. The core idea behind the economic model is, has always been, and will always be: ""Minimum viable issuance to secure the network"".

This is false.  Specifically, Ethereum's policy has not ""always been"" ""minimum viable issuance"" or ""minimum necessary issuance.""  The first instance of either of those phrases appears to be early 2019, judging by google search + web.archive.org.

Ethereum's original economic policy was ""5 Ether per block, in perpetuity"", with the intent that ""5 Ether per block"" would represent an increasingly small rate of inflation as the monetary base grows.

If you wish to counter that claim, please find a reference to this concept (hopefully the exact phrase, but an explanation would do) that predates, say, 2018.

> Anyone can propose an Ethereum Improvement Proposal. You just have to convince others it's a good idea to implement it (most EIPs don't get implemented and fall into obscurity) and the clients could just refuse to code it in if it's a very bad idea. The more time passes, the harder it becomes to push changes to the Ethereum protocol and everything converges to the status quo. (This doesn't close the door to further innovation however, as it's still an open platform on which anyone can build)

This is subject to the [Tyranny of Structurelessness](https://www.jofreeman.com/joreen/tyranny.htm), and isn't as transparent as it appears on the surface.

> Vitalik regularly gets his proposals blocked by client teams, other researchers, or the community in general.

[citation needed]. To date, I've not seen a single Vitalik-supported EIP get rejected; nor have I seen a single Vitalik-rejected EIP get accepted.  If either of these is a regular occurrence, I suspect this will be easy to provide.

> It wasn't a bailout of Vitalik and his pals, it was a bailout of a huge chunk of the community from an event that could have killed the whole thing in its infancy.

This is also incorrect.  The biggest voter turnouts were less than [15% of hashrate](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4tffta/hard_fork_voting_and_node_adoption_results/) and less than [10% of coins](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/6d62td/the_story_behind_ethereum_classic_etc_and_whos/di3a0ql/).  This is neither a ""huge chunk of the community"" nor (more importantly) a majority of the community.  The implication of this basic fact is that this was indeed a *minority bailout fork*. 

In fact, the *only* deciding factor was which side of the fork was chosen to be the default by the developer-sanctioned clients.  In fact, Vitalik goes on to admit this in his writing about ""legitimacy"", the very one you linked.  The chain that the core developers committed to continuing development on was the ""legitimate chain"", because they lent it their legitimacy.  Let's not forget that the one vote that was supposedly a ""community vote"" that ""determined what the default option would be"" was originally and explicitly called out as *not being an official vote*, with those same developers committing to never treat it as such.  They then changed their minds on this approximately 12 hours before they released the client*s* that would support this fork, indicating that the core developers had already decided *internally* what the outcome would be.

In a network that cannot achieve a majority quorum of voters, the controlling stake is controlled by whoever gets to set the defaults and deem to be the ""legitimate"" outcome.  In this case, that was Vitalik and a (relatively) small set of developers of the Ethereum clients.  I've [talked about this in depth](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7y166g/on_the_topic_of_decentralized_governance/dud1evl/) when considering the implications of Ethereum's ""opt-out"" governance model.

Let's not forget that [Vitalik was actively buying DAO tokens at the time](https://twitter.com/vitalikbuterin/status/741832934814949377).  If that's not an economic indicator that he had total confidence that the fork would happen, even before community votes happened, I don't know what could convince anyone.  Economic incentives are what this entire ecosystem is built on, are they not?

Additionally, the [DAO hack was not an existential threat](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4rohdy/vlad_zamfirs_thoughts_on_the_hard_fork/d52s60v/).

> As far as the initial distribution goes

This sidesteps the issue that the initial distribution was 100% opaque, and there *were no restrictions placed on insiders buying tokens in their own crowdsale*.  In fact, there's no plausible way [Joe Lubin](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2020/07/11/sale-of-the-century-the-inside-story-of-ethereums-2014-premine/) (for example, ctrl+f for his name) could have as much Ethereum as he did without participating in the sale himself.  As a beneficiary of the sale, this allows him to essentially buy Ether from himself during the crowdsale, as no cost (whenever he gets paid back).  In fact, before the crowdsale was even done, the Ethereum Foundation was [already taking distributions](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/08/08/announcement-on-planned-exodus-withdrawal/) from the Exodus address to ""pay back loans"".  Who were those loans being paid back to?  It's plausible that some of these were loans taken out by insiders to buy tokens in the crowdsale, after which they paid back the loans and kept the purchased Ether.

This is the crucial difference between an ICO (Ethereum's in particular) and a public IPO: insiders are explicitly not allowed to participate in an IPO because they are the primary beneficiaries of the IPO.  There exist transparency requirements and legal restrictions that prevent double-dipping in IPOs; no such mechanisms existed in the Ethereum ICO.  In fact, from a purely economic standpoint, the beneficiaries of the Ethereum crowdsale would be considered ""irrational"" to *not* participate in their own sale, minting tokens for ""free"".  Given the pseudonymous nature of both Ethereum and Bitcoin, to anyone outside the scheme, their purchases would look identical to participants from ""the public"".  The *only* way to expose such a scheme would be for an insider to reveal the scheme.",positive,0.6129035,26
9747,2022-01-20,"Thank you so much for this informative post! 

**Question about Fees**: In point 2 you state ""It costs $5 on average to send any amount of Ether"" so I'm curious where hugely high fees come from. I've never spent under $200 in fees to purchase ERC-20 tokens. I understand you said Ether and not its tokens, but is that the only reason? If it's simply a matter of supply and demand and the average is $5, I'd expect for every transaction costing $100 would be balanced with dozens of transactions under $1, right? I'm not saying you're wrong in any way, I just lack enough knowledge to understand how my experiences with tokens (and the general perception that ETH fees are astronomical) can be true if the average cost is $5.

9751,2022-01-25,"Back with some more corrections:

> Ether isn't meant to be a day-to-day currency that will replace fiat. The use-case of Ether isn't to pay for bread and milk, it's to pay for gas fees and secure the network. All the other use-cases derive from Ether's scarcity, but they're not strictly necessary.

This hasn't always been true.  [See Vitalik's memorable bag on Bitcoin's failure to scale its L1](https://youtu.be/qPsCGvXyrP4?t=3869), for an example.  At the time, he was pushing for massive scaling of L1, and even had an early Casper toy model showing block times of 4 seconds and throughput of thousands of transactions per second. (Unfortunately I can't find the source video for this, but I remember it being a presentation, and the output was just console output of a cli tool, very barebones).

Part of the original plan [was indeed L2s](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/09/17/scalability-part-1-building-top/), the other part was definitely [L1 improvements via sharding](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/10/21/scalability-part-2-hypercubes/).  Part of the focus on L1 scaling was specifically to enable the ""day-to-day currency"" use-case, i.e. the one in the ""the internet of money"" quote.

The narrative that Ethereum *isn't* supposed to be a day-to-day currency has evolved *in response* to Ethereum's lack of ability to scale.  This is a direct parallel to the evolution of the ""store of value"" narrative in Bitcoin, which *also* started as a ""peer-to-peer cash equivalent"".  The idea that there are cases that derive from ""Ether's scarcity"" is also a more recent narrative development; this is especially apparent when you consider that Ether wasn't [intended to be scarce in the first place](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/s8mnwb/a_collection_of_various_things_the_average/htkktzm/?context=3).

More post-hoc rationalization from the community in general.  I mean, it's fine to evolve a narrative over time in response to reality; what's rather disingenuous is to pretend that the new narrative has *always* been the narrative.  Strong ""we have always been at war with Eastasia"" vibes.

> The Ethereum Foundation is more of a coordinator than a dictator. It's much more of a community-focused bottom-up approach than the top-down structure people think.

Again, see the [Tyranny of Structurelessness](https://www.jofreeman.com/joreen/tyranny.htm).  All this particular organizational structure has done is replace explicit hierarchies with implicit ones that are only navigable through political means.  Decentralization on this front almost always results in *more* consolidation of power, not *less*.  Again, see also [Vitalik's post on legitimacy](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html), which addresses the same set of problems from a different angle.

> There is no ""technical debt"" preventing Ethereum from scaling.

There actually is a good amount of technical debt. The majority of it stems from the focus on L1 scaling early on, presumably due to the lack of actual solutions for scaling the EVM itself.

But don't take my word for it: [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/sbppnq/what_technical_debt_all_credit_to/hu4860j/) seems to sum up some notable examples.

It's worthwhile to point out that while ""technical debt is preventing Ethereum from scaling"" is a potent FUD narrative against Ethereum, despite only being partly correct, ""what technical debt?"" is equally vapid.  As a general rule of thumb: anyone trying to come up with clever comebacks to narratives is probably more interested in popularity than in ensuring that people have adequate information to combat said narratives.  If anything, they're probably trying to distract from the valid criticisms that effective negative narratives contain.",positive,0.90545356,4

Ethereum's tech is a series of solutions to problems that aren't there.

Ethereum doesn't want to be momey, but does want to be money, and wants to have value for security, but also wants to be super decentralized crypto

In practicality EIPs are basically decided by the same handful of people no matter how many times you say that technically anyone can propose them.

Eth is dirty from its VC roots, and the fact it violated Code is Law to protect DAO assets (speaking of which the US SEC later said the DAO was an unregistered security, demonstrating Ethereum's devs and participants have a nebulous grasp on the law). Eth is just an IPO (ico) on a blockchain.

Eth never reaches its deadlines, always has excuses, promises something else is the real solution to an underlying problem, and then tries to be everything at once.

I installed MetaMask and started using it for the first time ever. I perceived it as ""some app you need to have installed to access some web3 services, such as Uniswap"". So I did it.

Then I sold some different altcoins to get $100 of ETH. Transfer from Coinbase to Metamask - paid very minimal fees (0 coinbase fee, very small network/transaction fee), and it arrived fast.

Then I tried MetaMask and its ""Swap"" feature. Like, I wanted 10$ of Chainlink. And then I got greeted by a 40$ (network) fee.

Then I go into Metamask advanced settings to try and lower my gas cost. Get errors that wont allow.

Then I go to Uniswap site directly, cuz that was my initial goal. Same thing, massive fees, but now I can go into advanced settings and lower my gas costs, cuz the settings are not disabled.

welp - the two transactions I tried, both failed, and I lost \~15$. I'm gonna put it down as ""Education costs/expenses"".

I mean, I THINK I understand the reasons why they happened, and I don't feel like I got scammed, nor that it was an unfair situation. I'm just bummed that the network fees are so high.

But what I do feel is anxious. I can't wait for the several updates that ETH 2.0 has lined up for next year, to make using Eth much more convenient and efficient. It feels like the year \~2000, and using the Internet then.

If you need a car, house, jacket, hardware (cold) wallet, you deposit your ETH in a lending protocol, borrow a stable coin or a low-interest coin, turn that into cash on a CEx. Make your purchase, repay your loan in a timely fashion. Remember, the longer the loan will last, the more likely you will need to borrow a stable coin. Some platforms though have really expensive APR's on stables. So DOYR and plan out your purchase realistically.

Wei and Gwei are very Chinese, and being half Chinese as well, I don't really want to tie it to China even subconsciounsly. 

Ada and babbage are much more arbitrary sounding. I could see Ada being used, but again there's not obvious tie to Ethereum so it raises the barrier of entry and is another term to remember. Babbage, to me, sounds infantile, and doesn't ""feel"" like a currency name.  


Szabo seems hard to pronounce. It's definitely not intuitive, and that psychologically always hurts a term in terms of its stickiness. 

Finney and Shannon are people names and definitely not right for a currency. 

Of the names, ether is the best, but because it's not a one to one correspondence to ETH might be pretty confusing.

10036,2021-11-24,"IMO this is an unfortunate side-effect of high price that we just have to put up with. Switching to finney would lead to mass confusion and questions like ""how do I swap my ETH for finney to use this rollup?"" from the same people who currently don't even know what a gwei is and only focus on the quote in USD provided by MetaMask for the transaction fees with 0 awareness of the dozens of technical details that lead to that total fee.

The alternative is to keep everything as-is and accept that Ether is more of a ""under the hood"" asset that will more or less stop being held and used by mainstream people when they're off playing on rollups that have their own native coins (where the swap to ETH is done under the hood to pay for L1 fees)

Thinking more long term here, eventually the ""speculative era"" of Ether will be over and the price of Ether will only go up a few boring %'s a year and the ""to the moon"" crowd will move on to rollup coins and forget about Ether without knowing they're still interacting with it indirectly. Arguably this bias of ""Ether is too expensive, I missed out and will buy X coin instead"" is already happening and will keep happening even more in a world where Ether has massive dominance and most top 50 coins are eth-powered rollup coins. And I could even see Ethereum being left out of articles and discussions comparing coins altogether, because Ether is a ""special case"" or something that doesn't apply to whichever metrics will be relevant by then.

Those left still buying/using/holding Ether directly will have a vested interest in knowing exactly what's what, and for those people, a high price of ETH and a few subdivisions won't be a confusing pain point in any way.",positive,0.80263406,2

2) In the 10s...seemed again it was ready to pop. Great financial crisis hits and population again completely forgets about

10327,2021-02-08,"Everyone is mentioning L2 and Eth2. But the simplest near-term solution would be for /u/vbuterin and the rest of the core team to increase the block gas limit. Right now it's 12.5 million. Doubling it to 25 million would relieve a tremendous amount of pressure and drastically reduce gas fees. Just as it did last summer the last time the block size was increased. 

The primary argument against this is that it makes it more expensive to operate a full node. But right now high gas fees are much more an existential threat to the project. The P2P mainnet is extremely healthy, and lack of nodes is definitely not a problem.

I've experimented with continuously re-constructing 50 million or even 100 million gas pending blocks from the TxPool. A beefy AWS instance doesn't even break a sweat at these block sizes. Three quarters of synced full nodes run in the cloud. Provisioning a larger server would take nothing more than a touch of a button.

10433,2022-06-09,">! Since staking rewards, through the analogy of a continuous stock split, are non-Cantillon, the only inefficiency in the process leading to wealth inequality or distortion of the market is the profit margins between the cut taken by staking pools and the cost to run the validators. We can put an absolute upper bound on the Cantillon profit by assuming the cost of running a staking pool is zero.

>! The max possible Cantillon profit from Ethereum staking is currently 0.6% of all staked ether. With 7.8% of the currently supply of ether staked this puts the maximum limit at 0.05% per year—about $17.5 million annualized. On a market-cap adjusted basis, the profit extraction in this worst case is less than 1% of the three-year average profit extraction by bitcoin miners.

>! As the supply of staked ether rises the theoretical Cantillon profit will increase but remain bounded by the spread between rewards and staking pool payouts. Even if every ether token was staked in a staking pool and all the pools were able to operate without cost while not having to compete on fees past the current level, the market cap adjusted Cantillon profit would still be smaller than that of bitcoin miners.

Taken from ‘other’ subreddit / article

 Twitter update from the Blockchain Association on current changes made to the wording of the crypto tax bill as of 10 pm EST 

1/ @blockchainassn and its 46 member companies—companies with tremendous expertise in the crypto ecosystem—appreciate the Senate’s ongoing engagement on the digital asset tax information reporting provisions in the bipartisan #infrastructurebill.

2/ While some minor improvements have been made, the latest language still poses fundamental concerns and questions about certain terms and definitions used in the provision.

3/ To be clear, the Blockchain Association firmly believes that all taxpayers should pay the taxes they owe.

4/ Our Tax Working Group has had an ongoing dialogue with the IRS and relevant congressional committees for nearly 2 years to figure out how to best apply a reporting requirement to traditional crypto exchanges, enabling their customers to more easily pay taxes.

5/ However, this provision is written in a way that could be interpreted to apply to persons in the #crypto ecosystem who don’t have access to the information required for information reporting.

6/ As this bill continues to move through the Senate, we urge Senators to clarify that the language doesn’t capture non-custodial entities in the digital asset ecosystem.

7/ If these network participants—who don’t have any customer relationships—are required to provide such information, it will be impossible to comply, driving innovation and business overseas.

8/ The industry should know—and needs to know—how this provision applies, but it still remains unclear. We look forward to continuing this dialogue and sincerely thank Senate offices for their engagement and attention to this issue so far.

My C/A Agreement covers Cedar, but not LLN.

Project Hamilton (MIT people in charge of CBDC tech) proposed a [proof of authority (POA)](https://i.imgur.com/6ruA7Lk.png) protocol as the L1. The banks hated the idea. Were almost unanimously opposed to the prototype.

They argued a POA with user wallets that enable

* Holder accounts
* p2p payments
* bill pay
* direct to merchant pay

threaten their business! The Dallas Fed supports banking partners. They wrote a research paper to counter the phase 1 blockchain protocol. Their proposal centers on ***disintermediation.***

This is a dangerous precedent. In summary, disintermediation is a bank-sponsored plan that argues that running a digital currency system is too difficult for just the government to handle themselves. Authority needs to be shared (disintermediated).

Banks suggest they need to be involved if USD wishes to compete with e-rmb.

The US govt is so scared of e-rmb they're considering enacting this crazy plan.

Please be mindful of the threats.

Eg:

Some people are estimating a 5-10k target for ETH during this current bull run (which could last from now until anywhere between end of May to December)

You have 1 ETH.

So let’s say you do your research and you think that 7.5K is a good target…

Your sell targets could be something like:

+20% -> sell 10% ($240)
+30% -> sell 10% ($260)
+40% -> sell 10% ($280)
+50% -> sell 20% ($600)
+100% -> sell 30% ($1200)
+300% -> sell everything ($3750)

At the end of this you would have $6330

When the market crashes and ETH comes back down, you can either do the same thing on the way down in reverse, or wait until it get’s to a stable baseline and re-invest.

In the previous bull runs, BTC never went below the local top preceding the bull run… Many people think that means if BTC reaches more than 100k this bull run, BTC will never go below 40k again.

If ETH followed that (it didn’t last time and fell to $80) that would mean it could fall all the way back down to $400.

If you are patient, that would mean you are in a position to pick up 15 ETH this time next year. A great position to be in come NEXT bull run when the price will undoubtedly go even higher… (who knows, if gas fees come down to cents and the network can support more people, we could be talking about a 20k or 30k ETH as soon as 2024)

Time passed and I became interested in rooting servers for their bandwidth and storage. None of it was malicious and I never stole money or propriety information, it was all based in curiosity. Right around this time I was graduating college (non IT degree). I was becoming disenfranchised realizing how it all came down to money. All of the community members I came up with started “hacking” for real, for monetary purposes. Or becoming freelance pen testers. *If I went to school for IT I might have turned it into a career.* . Fast forward 10+ years with no coding and I feel lost.

11510,2021-09-23,"I know this website is US-centric, but this is akin to stopping a river with your hands. You cant stop DeFi like this, because it's just as easy to move a company abroad. US is one market, not all markets. DeFi is more likely to thrive in secondary markets rather than speculative ones. It will acquire enough critical mass that it wont really be something SEC can do about.

They are indeed trying to bottleneck DeFi with regulations, and it will really make it harder for US residents to use it... but watch it grow anyway. Unless the US has the idea to actively sanction 75% the world (that WILL adopt this), money will still flow.

Also bears in mind to know what the crypto side is doing. This is not a side made of ""wen moon"" retail retards. The current large players in the space right now know how to lobby, and they will play the same game.

11511,2021-06-27,"Anyone know why the gas spiked so much today? No crazy price movements happened and that's usually what spikes the gas.

&#x200B;

UPDATE: Did some investigative work by looking at etherscan, it looks like the culprit may have been some random token: [https://etherscan.io/token/0x1cbb182322aee8ce9f4f1f98d7460173ee30af1f](https://etherscan.io/token/0x1cbb182322aee8ce9f4f1f98d7460173ee30af1f)

It seems that there were a lot of transactions for bulk buys of this token in a short amount of time. Gas fees seemingly went up around the time the tokens first started being sold and went back down after all 10,000 were sold. I have no idea what this token is, I will assume it's some pump and dump. Anyways, gas fees seem to be back down now.

UPDATE 2: After gas fees went down to around 15, they shot back up to around 450, even higher than before. What is going on???

UPDATE 3: Many people are looking at this post and the current gas fees and are calling my post misleading, so I'd like to clarify. Yesterday, gas fees went from 10 to around 200 gwei, and then back down to 20 in a period of about 30 minutes. After that, it spiked back up to nearly 450 gwei, before coming back down to 10 about 30 minutes later.",neutral,0.5339421,85

One *major* difference that you forgot to mention was that with the DAO fork, the core developers were nearly unanimous in their support for the fork.  There might have been one developer who was ambiguous (avsa, maybe?), but I don't recall there being any that were actually against it.

With the Parity wallet bug, the core developers were pretty cleanly divided, with the Parity team in favor and the rest of the devs either ambiguous or against it.

11716,2021-07-05,"> in order to change the balance of Ether in a child contract, you have to fork from the block that includes the DAO attack transaction.

No, that's not correct.

Imagine Ethereum is an Excel spreadsheet. Each contract's balance is stored in a different cell in the spreadsheet, and transactions modify the values of those cells in accordance with the rules of the blockchain. So when the TheDAO hack happened a transaction was sent that changed the value of TheDAO's balance from 20,000,000 to 15,000,000 and the balance of a child DAO under the hacker's control from 0 to 5,000,000 (I'm just making up these numbers for illustrative purposes). Under the rules of Ethereum at the time there was no way to craft a transaction that would have set TheDAO's balance back to 20,000,000 again. So the hard fork had to change those rules for this one specific address at one specific time. The hard fork added a rule that said ""as of block X, the balance of the hacker's DAO is 0 and the balance of the recovery contract's address is 5,000,000."" The original transaction that the hacker issued was still valid and part of the blockchain's history, but the results of that transaction were undone with a second change.

While all that was going on other unrelated transactions continued coming in and changing the values of other unrelated addresses, but the fork didn't affect any of those other addresses.

If the stolen funds had not been locked in just that one child DAO address, then yeah, it would have been impossible to untangle all the subsequent changes without doing a full rollback.",positive,0.75846934,18

11900,2021-11-27,"**The eventual end goal of Ethereum is to be the platform that people build rollups on top of.** The reason that the developers moved to a rollup centric roadmap, i.e. shards, is to make data availability to rollups fast, abundant, and cheap. This results in L2 being extremely fast and cheap. This hopefully will encourage everyone to move to L2. With fewer people directly interacting on L1 the L1 fees will become cheaper which in turn will make L2 fees even cheaper. Read on to find out how.  
  
L2 is like carpooling. Instead of everyone taking their individual car to work they all meet up in one place and takes a huge bus to work. This will lower the tx fees on L1 which in turn will lower the fees an L2 will have to pay to settle on L1 which will mean that the portion of the fee that the ""carpooler"" on L2 will have to pay will be smaller.  
  
**Example: Ethereum is a single lane highway. The government (L1) in this scenario charges people to use space when the highway gets congested. The more congestion (tx's\*), the higher the fees. The government wants people to carpool so they pass a law that lowers the fees busses (L2 rollups) need to pay. This is what EIP 4488 is going to do. It will lower the call data gas fee and will therefore make settling to L1 5x cheaper while not affecting L1 transactions. L2 will now have a much cheaper tx fee to settle to L1 which becomes very cheap when it is amortized across hundreds of people's individual transactions. Imagine its $50 for a car and $10 for a bus. The car because it is individual pays this every time, but the bus takes that $10 and spreads it across all the riders. More riders mean cheaper individual tx fee.**  
  
Eventually most people use L2 so now there are hundreds fewer cars on the road so congestion as a whole is lower which means that the price busses (L2 rollups) and regular cars(L1 tx) pay is cheaper. Ex: $10 for regular cars and $2 for a bus spread among all riders. This will encourage even more people to use L2 which will take all those transactions off of L1 which will mean L1 transaction fees will come down. Imagine how empty the road will be if everyone used a bus to transact. Read on to find out about L2 security.  
  
\*tx is shorthand for Transaction  
  
Since you can interact directly with the smart contract to withdraw your funds from L2, ALL actual L2's inherit the security of L1 but without the congestion and the fees. The L2 amortizes the fees across thousands of transactions and submits one tx to L1. This will lower gas fees. The quicker we all move to L2 the faster L1 gas fees will come down.",positive,0.8764359,4

>The scheme we have today, where all resources are combined together into a single multidimensional resource (“gas”), does a poor job at handling these differences. For example, on average transaction data plus calldata consumes ~3% of the gas in a block. Hence, a worst-case block contains ~67x (including the 2x slack from EIP 1559) more data than an average-case block. Witness size is similar: average-case witnesses are a few hundred kB, but worst case witnesses even with Verkle gas reforms 28 would be a few megabytes in size, a 10-20x increase.

>Shoehorning all resources into a single virtual resource (gas) forces the worst case / average case ratio to be based on usage, leading to very suboptimal gas costs when the usage-based ratio and the ratio of the burst and sustained limits that we know clients can handle are very misaligned.

Basically more optimizations.

I am not only a miner but also an eth lover, holder, even trader.

I saw flexpool and miners had a discussion with eth devs, and it likely we will active eip1559. So, I think many guys here dont really catch the progress. 

In that discussion, they may remove ASIC machines, and we still adopt eip1559 with a new base fee adjustment. 

Holders and investors say miners are greedy. Miners says investors and holders are greedy. An endless argue. 

My from view, this should not a war of mouths. We discuss, find out a good enough solution for whole eth community. I do believe eip1559 is good for eth price and UX, then it should be good for eth community as a whole.

EIP1559 is a well designed user interaction improvement for Ethereum. The fees burn is not the primary goal, it's a necessary feature to achieve the EIP (avoid fees war in the pool).

Most arguments here to prevent eip1559 are mostly uneducated on how Ethereum works, what is eip1559 targeted for or how it will end up for miners.

The only one I could argue with is ""we should protect the miners since they invested to run th network"". That is absolutely false! This is actually the design of PoW: we need mining to be a greedy selfish entreprise without solidarity !
I think I am politically left sided (french socialism) but yet  mining must remains a individual selfish act. 
So if mining becomes more profitable (price, usage, fees to the roof) then more miners joins. And if mining becomes less profitable (for any reason) then miners quits, and that is the exact intended equilibrium designed by Satoshi Nakamoto et al. in the first place !

And the publicly GPU oriented algo we use does enforce that a bit further: if you have to quit mining because it is not profitable anymore then you sell your rig and you square yourself pretty easily. So please cut the crap with the ""we must protect miners because they do all the work"".
Devs are doing all the work.

Layer 2 was always the way to scale any crypto.  The reality is that blockchain has a finite capacity regardless of which chain you are talking about.

It was discussed in the original bitcoin whitepaper which is the primary inspiration for every single crypto out there. The only way to maintain consensus AND decentralization while providing scaling to significant levels is via layer 2 solutions.

As ETH becomes more valuable, transacting on chain gets more and more expensive because there is no mechanism to adjust gas price to token value, the only mechanism is based on how busy the network is.

Layer 2 solutions allow for bulk processing thus amortizing the cost of gas across multiple operations/transactions which lowers the per transaction cost.  Batching via layer2 also reduces the load thus reducing gas.  It sets up a virtuous cycle.",positive,0.9150854,21

If you designed a blockchain system where you had a chain consisting of nothing but zk-rollup contracts, and all the transactions were in zk-rollups sequenced by someone in the blockchain's validator set, that whole system would be ""layer 1"" not ""layer 2"". But it would have the exact same technical properties as Ethereum with zk-rollups.

Actually, there's one place where such a design would be different, but in a way that I think is obviously better: If we had a bug in the L1 software we'd do our reasonable best to sort it out in the way the protocol users intended, whereas if we had a bug in a rollup we'd probably say, ""that's a user space bug not a protocol bug, L1 functioned correctly so there's nothing we can do, sorry for your loss"". Likewise, we can use social consensus to upgrade the L1, but if you want to upgrade an L2, you need a formal upgrade process obeying the rules of the underlying chain, which will be less secure. So I feel like ""enshrined rollups"" situation is better here; If in practice everybody has to use rollups, they should also be able to take advantage of the social consensus that the L1 uses for upgrades and bug fixes.

The benefit of the L1/L2 separation is that for a number of reasons some of which are good, it takes Ethereum core research a really long time to ship stuff, whereas competing L2 teams are shipping stuff we didn't even know was possible a few years ago at amazing speed. That probably justifies using having an inferior system to one with rollups as part of L1, but it is an inferior system.",positive,0.83727473,3

This applies to coins, tokens, protocols, networks, dapps, etc etc etc. It is 100% why bitcoin will never disappear, even if the age of smart contract native networks overshadow it. It is why Ethereum will never disappear, even if another smart contract native network touts better features and scaling.

I would strongly support a staking pool that donated a portion of the rewards to Gitcoin, or perhaps even a Gitcoin ‘Endowment’ pool where you lock Eth in a smart contract (or donate permanently) and the resulting staking rewards are split along the quadratic funding distribution.

It's interesting to me that the example given for Schelling Fences and the generally very poor state of today's media are intertwined as they are.

We achieve a genuinely immutable and uncensorable media and there will be much drama, but we get a lot in return, and for free.

The only question is how much percent would be efficient for an application/company to contribute to public goods? Is it worth it to share 5% of the profit only because of marketing reasons? If Uniswap do it Sushi will follow? I think the answer is depends on the legitimacy of voluntary taxing itself.

So, alternatively, what if people could direct their stake rewards via the staking contract?

If there was, for example, some parameter in the staking contract to denote a cause (Gitcoin or other) this would allow anyone including validators to direct stake rewards and allow for analytics to see how many eth are being staked “for” a specific organization.

Pool operators could then also integrate options to allocate a certain number of eth towards various beneficial organizations (e.g. 10% to gitcoin, 10% to EFF, 10% to giveth, 70% undirected with rewards back to user).

You could have analytics / leaderboards with which causes have the most staked eth or which are maybe underfunded.",positive,0.9312895,6

How much of it would go into R&D? Probably not 100%, but certainly not 0% either.

In a sense, current blockchains already do this using pre-mining. But it goes with the trust issues of having the creators running away after having sold all the pre-mined tokens without any development.

12438,2021-03-07,"TL;DR

 Ethereum blockchain developers approved one of the biggest changes to the network since its inception in 2015, a shift that could spur even bigger gains in the price of its native cryptocurrency Ether.

Known as EIP 1559, the change solves a current problem: Ethereum users can only estimate how much Ether will be needed for transactions to be processed, a guessing game that has spawned sites such as ETH Gas Station to help people know how much to pay.

EIP 1559, which will become part of an upgrade in July or August, will embed an average price into the network itself making the guessing game obsolete.

The reduced supply of Ether will likely lead to rising prices as demand for the coins increases, said Eric Turner, director of research at Messari, a cryptocurrency analytics firm.

Until EIP 1559 goes into effect after being approved Friday, the supply of Ether was theoretically infinite, leading to criticism that its underlying monetary policy was weak and inflationary.",neutral,0.92108786,12

Take a step back. Why do products win in the real world? 

They generally win for two reasons

1. They provide a 10x improvement in experience. 
2. They can acquire customers easily.

Don't view Ethereum as a conventional product. View Ethereum as a distribution layer with the largest reach. 

If you are building a protocol or a company you are trying to make money. You need to acquire customers. If you can acquire customers and keep them, you win. Ethereum, by virtue  of having the largest reach, wins the distribution game for your protocol today.

**There is one other reason why developers would choose to build on Ethereum.**

That is the ecosystem. As a programmer, if I am trying to learn something, I will find a tutorial and learn online. This is why Javascript dominates over other languages (apart from Java, which solved distribution in other ways). 

This also means that there are more developers on ethereum and ethereum is more likely to last. Hence, as someone who would start a protocol, I will invest in the platform that has the best support and the largest amount of talent.

The reason is because Vitalik envisioned the system to be run on an ""relatively affordable"" system running at around 5% load. Ethereum can even run on a Raspberry pi in that ""relatively affordable"" scheme.

Why the ""relatively affordable"" reason? because you need enough user to make a decentralized system. If there are not enough users, then the concept of decentralized cryptocurrency is not feasible.

You have the right to ask that question and you are correct: the same NFT could have been on a cheaper fully decentralized blockchain with the same services. 

Now many here are saying Rollups solve this issue of higher fees. Ok for that to happen, the NFT you wanted will have to deploy on a L2 rollup chain like Optimistic, Arbitrum or other. Which one? No one knows, that is up to the NFT platform developer and the asset owner. Large NFT platforms like Opensea I'm told have not made the switch.

The article says this is why OpenSea removed their ""lazy mint"" option that allows creators to list their NFT and mint it only once there is a buyer. This obviously came as a result of the previous misinformation campaign about stolen artwork being sold on OpenSea as NFTs - again, NFTs that aren't actual NFTs because they weren't minted. 

I feel like so many people are missing key pieces of information about this situation, and a lot of people are very confused and angry as a result.

If an NFT is stolen and IS minted, OpenSea really needs to take those down. They're slacking on this issue. I don't think the solution is to remove the ""lazy mint"" option though. That's silly.",neutral,0.7574479,8

Scaling is still dubious but promising, there are many more, and the true worry I have for you is your misunderstanding of why others have reservations.   True, in the past, this type of enthusiasm has paid out EPICALLY for some, but for most it destroyed them.

Here’s something I learned…. People don’t *want* to learn.  They want stability and a comfortable life.  They don’t want to learn, they don’t want to change…. The majority of them, and only will change when the *have* to (read: it caused them more pain *not* to change than to change or adopt a new thing).

I believed in 2011 as bitcoin as freedom.  I believed as soon as someone saw this incredible tool everything would come crashing down to the new “standard”

I still was weary of satoshis main question… “can the blockchain hold value?  Or will it be diminished or replaced by some other blockchain or entity, or idea.”

That experiment remains to be seen.  Can a block chain store true value?   Can it?  Seriously.  It can to me, but ultimately it’s just numbers on a paper. 

I believe bitcoin can create accountability, but I also believe bitcoin can create a “I have all the bitcoin and you have none” for a new financial elite.  It’s fucked up.

There is so much to know still.  Ethereum allows blockchain to solve problems.  Ethereum eliminates financial fees and middle men which is disruptive.  I don’t mind this disruption because the jobs based on it are the Devil in the details or a necessary evil to banking… but I’m still not convinced, Eventhough I’m totally in on crypto, btc, eth, that it will eleiminate the oppressors in the financial world.

Fuck their interest rates.  Fuck their control.  Fuck their, “when it’s not going well we just work on quantitative easing and diminishment of currency value to achieve a political goal” type shit.

But the problem is… the real problem is… people don’t. Give. A. Shit.  They want their oppression and guise of stability.

I wish.  I wish everyone saw the power of bitcoin and the freedom it implies.  The ability to not live under a constant interest rate, or rate of return for the owners of the world.  Fuck them.  Make them produce.  Pay them a menial wage for their 5 minutes on the computer to make a hundred lifetimes of value.

Unless these solutions are made to be perfectly seamless/invisible, Ethereum will be seen as this overly complicated ecosystem with insanely high fees on the main network people have used for years. It's facing stiff competition from other blockchains in terms of UX, technology, fee structure.

I hope that they are able to fix this while maintaining a simple user experience, because the fees are unacceptable.

ERC-4337 sets a standard so that any wallet software can leverage the same infrastructure, like gas fee abstraction and signature bundling. As it requires no protocol changes, you can use the standard today (although the spec is not yet finalized, so devs may have to make small tweaks).

EIP-3074 allows existing Externally Owned Accounts (basically just a keypair, and probably what you use as your wallet) to authorize a contract to transact on their behalf. This will allow users of EOAs to migrate to a smart contract wallet, without having to send all of their assets to a new wallet or change their address.

This will happen because it essentially allows for kind of pre-approval of a tx (within guidelines) that would be a “pull” (eg a draw of funds from your wallet to your internet provider for the monthly bill). 

The distinction here is the who starts this action.
The hangup today is that Ethereum’s core protocol requires a signature from the users wallet (as the only way) to catalyze/start a (smart contract) transaction - which means it can only do “push” tx’s and does not allow “pulls” because the user is not signing a tx to start a pull, it is a tx initiated outside of the wallet.

But you have to pay a small amount to write transactions on that list. When this list becomes very popular the demand increases and the queue of people gets bigger. The price to write things on the list goes up. 

What ethereum side chains have done is create scale. They essentially make their own lists and then send back a summary of that list to the main ethereum chain. This would be ideal where you have lots of micro transactions like in a real time game or with a casino and then need to send their balance at the end (but not every single game that was won or lost). This is called a second layer solution. Some of these type of solutions are now working. Matic have just turned on their second layer solution mainnet for example. This decreases cost and increases speed. In theory you could have limitless layers upon layers.

NFT would help me (and those artists) make this leap into digital when it makes sense. 

I’m particularly intrigued on how this will work with photography.

Soon, we're launching the private Discord where we will be designing their characters, and the tokenomics. It will be ready in the next summer.

13077,2021-02-07,"I think people don't really get the point of NFTs yet. that's what makes them so undervalued. In 10 years or 20 years. all of those OG NFTs will be selling for millions if not more.

The biggest question we should ask ourselves isn't if the artwork can be copied. The artwork can always be copied. But one thing that can never be copied is the token itself, signed by the original author. Is the NFT a digital representation of the actual art OR is the art a representation of the NFT token? What is art? and why does it even have any value? I can tell you the value of the art does not simply stem from the artwork itself, but rather by the story behind it. The true art in its purest essence isn't the artwork or the thing that you can see or touch, but rather the ideas that it represents just like how we as humans aren't just our bodies but rather our consciousness as well.

In this way, NFTs capture the essence of art better than any other means imo. You can always  copy any piece of art digital or virtual and you could probably even get an exactly replica of the mona lisa. But the NFT token itself stays forever (longer than a deBeers diamond). Even the artist cannot replicate that same NFT. Even if he reeditions the artwork years later, it won't be the same. It's kind of like an OG pair of AJ1 from 1985. There will never be one of those ever again. Wait until nostalgia starts to hit  the culture. Man cryptokitties hype may soar again.

Remember, it's not the artwork itself, i.e. the thing you can see or feel or touch that is valuable but rather the idea of it and the story behind it.

Why is the mona lisa worth so much when I can get a replica that looks exactly the same?  why is the price of a pair of OG AJ1 that MJ himself has worn be worth so much when you can get a new pair at the Nike Store for retail price (ok ok you can't anymore because of how hype AJ 1s are rn but they're still much less expensive on StockX than the OG ones)?

It's a matter of narratives and thinking? it's a philosophical question. Think about it. 10 years down the line, how will people look back at those?",positive,0.8922486,4

He suggested that a stablecoin project’s market activity “drops to near zero,” users should be able to extract the fair value of their liquidity from the asset. He also suggested that the project should implement a negative interest rate when it tracks a “basket of assets” that grows at 20%.

13248,2022-05-27,"Can someone explain to me how a stablecoin like RAI would handle the following situation?

Let's say there is much higher demand for owning RAI than for borrowing RAI, which is to say people want to buy RAI instead of borrowing RAI against ETH collateral. In this case the price of RAI would go up. If I understand correctly, the protocol would then work against that by making interest rates negative and therefore incentivizing the borrowing of RAI. People would then likely borrow RAI, do nothing with it and collect the negative interest rates, possibly sell them and therefore stabilize the price.

As long as rates are positive all RAI in existence are borrowed into existence. The protocol can then decrease the supply by increasing the rates and incentivizing people to return their borrowed RAI. But if rates go negative for long enough, RAI are created that are not borrowed.

If we assume that people would just hold the borrowed RAI in case of negative interest rates, then the rates have to be significantly negative for a significant amount of time in order to create enough coins that are actually sold to balance the price. This means that with enough demand for RAI, over time the majority of the circulating supply would not be borrowed RAI anymore.

What happens if now the demand for RAI goes down and interest rates turn positive? The people that held borrowed RAI only to generate more RAI return their RAI to the protocol but now all the additional RAI that was created through negative interest rates is still circulating. It might even be that all borrowed RAI is returned to the protocol but there is still a lot of remaining RAI in circulation and the protocol has no mechanism anymore to make these coins more valuable.

I guess in this scenario RAI would just lose its peg and become unusable as a stablecoin. Any thoughts on this?",positive,0.8395672,20

The single remaining holder would be able to buy the safe in the liquidation auction, use their RAI to immediately clear its debt, and withdraw the ETH. This gives them the opportunity to get a fair price for their RAI, paid for out of the ETH in the safe.

> Another extreme case worth examining is where RAI becomes the primary appliation on Ethereum. In this case, a reduction in expected future demand for RAI would crater the price of ETH. In the extreme case, a cascade of liquidations is possible, leading to a messy collapse of the system. But RAI is far more robust against this possibility than a Terra-style system.

Other points:crypto-only

1. While DEXs are on the rise and in very very early stage there are many problems to fix which traditional exchanges have already gone through. Bad behavior such as front-running, etc is hurting, normal traders. It essentially means that the quotes and spreads you are getting are very bad because bad players are taking a cut from you. This is why exchanges and financial services are regulated so that this behaviour is being reduced by a lot - in my opinion something that crypto world has to wake up to. I'm sure that there are technical solutions to combat bad behaviour.

That said, ethereum hard forks are different in that a lot of effort goes into making sure every client points on the new chain starting from the decided block, and everyone discards the old chain after that. Plus there's the built-in ""difficulty bomb"" coded in that makes mining on the old chain harder and harder to mine so there's no point mining on it at all. Part of the upgrades bundled in this hard fork pushes the difficulty bomb for later.

So effectively there are not gonna be any old ethereum coins, just the new ones with the same value as the previous ones.

Instead, someone else referring to the document and analyzing it would use ""read:_"" to make the meaning of the document more clear in a non-formal way. Usually ""read:_"" is in parentheses.

\> Edward Snowden's leaked documents showed that the NSA had potentially placed a backdoor into this newer function, allowing them to break its encryption if they ever needed to.

Call for quote.  Odds are you got some of the technical details wrong.

First, SHA-3 and Keccak are hash functions, not encryption.  There is no cracking a hash like, say AES, which encrypts streams of data.  Hashes are inherently lossey: Keccak and SHA-3 reduce large amounts of data to 256 bits.  The only ""hack"" would be to easily create collisions. And so far all collision attacks of note leave evidence it's a manufactured collisions, typically via sections of unused data.  The NSA has no useful ""backdoor"" on a hash function because it makes no sense.

Second, the differences between Keccak and SHA-3 are minuscule, relating to the ""padding"" at the end of a message.  Keccak uses 8-bit based padding assumptions while the other uses 1-bit-length padding assumptions.  This makes SHA-3 more suitable when the message being hashed are measured in bits not bytes. There is no nefarious back door here.

If you are looking for nefarious back doors, look at cryptography standards where arbitrary starting data is specified without a rational explanation for where it came from.  Some EC curves are unsuitable because there is no description of how the parameters were chosen, and in some cases describing how it was derived exposes data that can be used to ""backdoor"" signatures.  `Dual_EC_DRBG` is one place to look. This is considered to be one of the reasons the 'k' curves were picked for bitcoin, predictable constant selection significantly reduced the chances it is backdoored.

There may or may not be conspiracies in some of the cryptography available for Ethereum.  But SHA-3 isn't where you will find it.  There's just nothing to backdoor with what was done.",positive,0.6603319,85
14055,2022-12-12,"Ok so let me preface this with declaring that I'm _not_ an expert.

However. I find it very very unlikely that the proposed changes could achieve any kind of backdoor. These hash constructions simply does not work in a way that would make such a backdoor realistic.

What is generally believed (but not proven), that the `Dual_EC_DRBG` random number generator, which is a _completely different_, and I really mean, _totally very different_ algorithm, and has _nothing to do at all_ with SHA, was _probably_ backdoored, because there the mathematical possibility for this is present, and the seemingly random parameter choices couldn't be really motivated by anything else. So these days essentially nobody uses _that_.

For more details, I found this discussion back from during the standardization process, about the SHA-3 modifications: https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/10645/are-nists-changes-to-keccak-sha-3-problematic",positive,0.874118,94
14056,2022-12-12,"As others said, this is bullshit. SHA-3 is just a subset of  Keccak by setting some variables as not configurable:

> On August 2015 NIST announced that SHA-3 had become a hashing standard additional to SHA-2. However the hash from Keccak differs from SHA-3 hash and this became controversial among security communities and forums. Some argued that NIST made the algorithm weaker than the original Keccak and other said NIST put backdoor. The irony of all these arguments was that no one looked at the details of the code to see what actually changed. The Keccak team who created the algorithm confirmed that the actual algorithm was not changed in SHA-3. **NIST only changed the padding** thus it's the reason that changes the hash from Keccak. **The security of the algorithm is not changed from the original Keccak.** So we can all be sure NIST did not make the algorithm weaker and SHA-3 is as strong as Keccak.

NIST adjusted some of the parameters of Keccak after the completion of the standards process, allegedly to improve its efficiency. This was occurring at the same time as heroic whistleblower Edward Snowden revealed documents that imply that NIST may have been improperly influenced by the National Security Agency to intentionally weaken the Dual_EC_DRBG random-number generator standard, effectively placing a backdoor in the standard random number generator."" and afterwards...

""While you may see ""SHA-3"" mentioned throughout Ethereum documents and code, many if not all of those instances actually refer to Keccak-256, not the finalized FIPS-202 SHA-3 standard. The implementation differences are slight, having to do with padding parameters, but they are significant in that Keccak-256 produces different hash outputs from FIPS-202 SHA-3 for the same input""",positive,0.686517,7

We expect this to happen around Wednesday, April 14, 2021, but because of block time variability, the exact date may change.

14203,2021-03-29,"I've read a bit on here and being new to the whole trading business I have a few questions on the topic, if someone more experienced than me can assist. Reading a bit more about DDoS I came across this article https://www.digitalattackmap.com/understanding-ddos/ that classifies the classes of the most common attacks. Wouldn't a scalping terminal like this one https://bittrade.one/ (which I personally use) solve at least some of the threats, or at least the problems would be reduced to those that the app could face? I'm really interested in the subject as I've only just recently started out, and I could say I also started with not such a common method, that is scalping.

14263,2021-01-09,"To anyone using python + Ethereum, I highly recommend taking a look at Brownie. It is a wrapper over the presented web3py library. Brownie is most known for being a smart contract framework, but it will also make your daily life when interacting with Ethereum a lot easier!  Here are a few examples from the article in web3 and then in Brownie. 

Balances:  
`bal= pyEth.eth.getBalance(pyEth.eth.accounts[0])`

`bal = accounts[0].balance()`

Convert to Ether

`pyEth.fromWei(bal,'ether')`

`bal.to('ether')`

Sending Ether  
`tx = pyEth.eth.sendTransaction({`  
`'from': pyEth.eth.accounts[0],`  
`'to': pyEth.eth.accounts[1],`  
`'value': pyEth.toWei(3, 'ether')`  
`})`

`tx = accounts[0].transfer(accounts[1], ""3 ether"")`

Brownie natively understands Ethereum units. So `a[0].balance() == ""100 ether""` is a valid comparioson and wil be True if account 0 has 100 ether. 

Brownie also has customizable gas strategies with oracles included. So you can define your gas strategy and brownie will re-broadcast your transactions with higher gas prices as needed. For example:

`gas_strategy = GasNowScalingStrategy(""standard"", ""rapid"", 1.2, 5)`

This will start at a ""standard"" gasprice (according to [gasnow.org](https://gasnow.org)) and increase by a factor of 1.2 every 5 block until is mined. ""rapid"" is the maximum allowed gas price. You then simply pass the strategy object as the gas price:

`accounts[0].transfer(accounts[1], ""3 ether"", gas_price=gas_strategy)`

And finally, interacting with contracts is comically easy, no need to fetch any ABIs. Wanna transfer some Dai?

`dai = Contract.from_explorer(""0x6B175474E89094C44Da98b954EedeAC495271d0F"")`  
`dai.transfer(a[1], 1000e18, {'from': a[0]})`

Run a decent antivirus and don't let anyone else use the PC. Use a unique password for Metamask.

You didn't give authorization to some smart contract with unlimited fund withdrawal authority so it sounds likely you're computer itself my be compromised and the key to your wallet is being accessed by someone else. They use whats called a flashbot. Essentially as SOON as any eth hits you the transaction mempool, this bot will immediately make a new transaction with the same or lower Nonce number (eth rule says lowest none must be mined first) exact amount but with the bulk of it going to the miner. The miner is in on the gig, from what I can tell. This is actually in the nonce section of the transaction that pulled your mone out: Nonce: 0 (Also found 1 Other Dropped Txn #1 with the same \`From\` Account Nonce) So they used what's called a Dropped transaction replacement using a bot to do it super fast. See how they took 0.6xxx eth from the transfer side and put it under gas fee, that made it get picked up asap.

&#x200B;

If you go to the comment page of the miner who mined the transaction that took the money out of your wallet, you'll see a bunch of confused people with the same problem.

I also used metamask  to import a private key,  but not on my windows installation.  Never.

I bought a 32gb fast usb pen drive and i installed ubuntu in it. When i need to access my credible accounts (coinbase binance etc) I shut the computer down, plug the pen in it and boot ubuntu. Everything inside my ubuntu installation is vetted. Real urls to websites, real metamask apps. Before transferring any crypto, I send 0.05eth back and forth. 

If I need to connect metamask with anything DeFi, I boot a different 32gb usb pen  with a fresh ubuntu installation and i create a new metamask account and send to it only the funds needed, after sending 0.05eth back and forth again. 

Its also wise to never be in a hurry. Send a smallish amount to any new metamask installation  and wait 24h before using it for real. If the funds aren't missing, you are ok. This step would have saved you.

14579,2021-10-15,"Yang is confused. UBI and Bitcoin cannot coexist. One will have to give way to the other.

———-

EDIT: I wouldn’t have thought crypto enthusiasts need it spelled out. But apparently some do. 

Step #1: UBI cannot be implemented without using a fiat currency. It cannot be implemented with BTC. (Can we agree on this first point? I’m hoping that we don’t have to debate here, because if you do not understand this point, you need a lot more education than can be offered in a subreddit). 

Step #2: Those receiving a UBI in dollars will be receiving money that cannot keep up with price increases in groceries, transportation, education, entertainment, etc. they will always be on the losing end of that equation. Just think about how the top 1% have increased their wealth since 1971 as well as how the minimum wage has lost purchasing power since 1971 (even though it’s gone up in nominal terms). This is not coincidental. It is due to rampant money printing (https://wtfhappenedin1971.com/). It will be exacerbated with UBI. The elite will get more wealthy. Those receiving UBI will be continually unable to pay for life. They will petition the government to raise UBI, just like they do with minimum wage. The government will concede every 10 years or so, just like with minimum wage, but it will always be a step behind the high cost of living and thus UBI will never be enough. Meanwhile, those people saving in BTC will be getting more wealthy. 

Step #3: As BTC makes people more wealthy, Gresham’s Law will become more and more pronounced. The people receiving fiat dollars as part of their UBI will rush to get rid of their dollars as soon as possible. The process will increase in velocity year after year until it becomes exponential and hyperinflation sets in. 

Step #4: Society finally abandons all trust in the dollar. Bitcoin is unfazed during the entire process. In fact, it only gets stronger throughout the process.

That’s how UBI gives way to BTC. 

On the flip side, can UBI make BTC give way? No. UBI isn’t a threat to BTC in any way. However, I’m trying to be open-minded to how BTC could disappear while UBI continues to exist. Governments can not stop BTC while they act separately from each other. So, in an attempt to preserve their power, and for the first time in history, they may actually join together to outlaw Bitcoin. This would make way for UBI to be implemented. Of course it doesn’t fix the inherent problems with UBI. It just illustrates how BTC would have to be removed altogether for UBI to work. 

So, OVER TIME, one does not exist while the other exists.

When miners are out then ETH becomes more environmentally friendly, until then they (POW miners) are a costly 24/7 electricity gouging beast that won't ever stop so long as there's real money to be made. That aside, go and work with ETH. Every smart contract you do will cost extra for gas fees. The market price for that fee is extremely fluid and unpredictable. When a consumer sees something they want for .03 ETH and learns they must pay another .015-.025 ETH for the transaction fee it will be a deterrent for serious investors, especially if the price of 1 ETH breaks $4k again.

And yea everything will incorporate L2 *eventually*, but if you want to off-ramp to fiat or move anything to L1 for any reason, you're in for a bad time.

Edit for anyone thinking that the argument that there is no reason to move off L2 and that if you know you are going to then just don't move to L2:

Not everyone can anticipate when they are going to want or need to move back to L1. I moved it 4 months ago, at 54 Gwei. And I was moving a large amount so I was okay with the transaction fee.

I'm not sure that's an unpopular opinion at all to be honest. It is unquestionably quite an effort to get a home validator up and running. It's not insurmountable by any means, but it definitely reminds me of the early days of Ethereum before MEW when you had to sync a client before you could interact with the chain and use your wallet...

I'm sure we'll got more user friendly options eventually. You can already run a full node through Windows with 'NiceNode' [ https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/udw6ht/running_a_node_should_be_easier_so_i_built/ ] and so I don't expect it will be too long before home validators are available to those who would rather not mess about with Linux, Docker etc.

After all, let's face it: mining was even more difficult than that, since you needed at first knowledge about hardware itself on top of software. And it required a fairly important knowledge of accounting and economics to understand when it's profitable and how to maximize profit. It took time for it to become easier and more convenient.

There’s likely no way to remove that learning curve entirely. Sure graphical installers are being worked on, like wagyu installer. Dappnode is graphical now. And, as we see when there’s an issue, troubleshooting still requires the ability to type a command, read some logs; and remote access requires comfort with CLI.

TBH I think that the CLI stuff, as daunting as it may be, is the easy part. It’s harder to secure the machine one “does crypto on”, it’s harder to think through security for the mnemonic, it’s harder to describe that in a way that can be understood for heirs.

In a perfect ideal world, everything would be in ETH2 via sharding, pruned trees, etc...  But the reality is that the technology isn't there yet - and Vitalik talks at length about this in his blog.

There are also inherent trade-offs with any of the ""layer 2"" solutions.  They obviously cannot guarantee security to the same degree as the root blockchain, and users should understand the trade-off involved in each solution.

In the best case scenario of layer 2 - you pay a little fee and give up a little trust to the counterparty for routing transactions.   Using a Bank for your crypto is a the worst of both worlds - all the dependency on 3rd party financial system, with all the volatility of crypto.

This is certainly inaccurate as the current implementation of Arbitrum node sequencer is highly centralized where Offchain labs themselves run the sequencer. As much as we want to trust the team, its not \*decentralize\* nor \*trustless\* as there's a single point of failure leading to very high risks of MEV capture and trust assumptions.

2. Self-custodial wallets removed from mobile app stores.
3. Self-custodial wallets made illegal to ""keep everyone safe"". You can only own crypto if a bank or exchange custodies it for you.
4. Github source code for wallets deleted due to violations of these regulations. Hosting source code or posting wallet software online is illegal.
5. If you want to interact with smart contracts, your bank or exchange will have to do it for you.
6. Running full-nodes or staking becomes illegal, only the government or banks  are allowed to do it.
7. Public blockchains are finally phased out, and replaced by CBDC's. Your crypto is automatically converted into CBDC-FIAT by the government.
8. Cash is also banned for good measure....And then boom.  We're all in China!

I keep seeing so many people say dumb things like ""its what the market priced them at"" or ""people don't appreciate the value of art.""

No. Here is how it works.

1. I have $1M.
2. I buy art for $1M. Now the artist has $1M and I have art *worth* $1M.
3. There are now $2M worth of things in the economy because my action of buying it set its value. 
4. I can sell it for whatever I can get for it but unless it sells for something like $1, the market has agreed that it is worth close to $1M
5. The more people transact for it, the more data the market has that it really is worth $1M.
6. Outsiders genuinely buy into this market because it seems promising from the data.

All you really need is for people to have agreed in advance to do these transactions in a semi-plausible way and you are printing money out of thin air.

Honestly, probably one of the reasons for a big push for DOAs is enforce some of these scams, and why there are suddenly so many cringe podcasts about NFTs and DOAs. This is the difference between science and alchemy. Science is concerned with the truth. Alchemy is concerned with operational success. 

The only technological breakthrough that is achieved in NFTs is the ability to manipulate ""market price"" when tokens are all fungible.

15386,2020-12-04,"I'm somewhat more bullish on this idea than many other people, but it is important to understand the very subtle concerns at play.

**WARNING: long technical answer incoming but I have tried to make it as accessible as a technical deep dive realistically can be.**

First of all, a voting system has many very specific requirements that it must meet in order to be secure, some of which are counterintuitive and stricter than what you might expect. Paper-based voting satisfies all of these requirements. There are different ways of stating these requirements; this is simply my presentation.

* Correctness (the result actually is the correct result given what the votes were, and each voter can only vote once)
* Only registered voters can vote (this is easy: the voting authority maintains a list of public keys and enforces the one-per-person rule, and this can be made publicly verifiable)
* Censorship resistance (if you want to vote and are eligible, nobody can prevent you from voting, and your vote gets counted)
* Privacy (no one can see how you voted, or even whether or not you voted)
* Coercion resistance (you can't prove to a third party how you voted, even if you wanted to and even if you and the third party were cooperating throughout the process)

The first and third can be solved easily with ZK-SNARKs; it would be a simple retool of Zcash or tornado.cash. The second can be provided with a blockchain (yay!). But the fourth (very important to prevent selling votes) is much harder.

It turns out that there is cryptographic technology that can solve the fourth, but it requires a trusted intermediary. It basically involves everyone publishing their votes encrypted with the intermediary's public key, and the intermediary publishes a ZK-SNARK of decrypting the messages and verifying the result (there's also a bit of trickery that allows voters to change their keys to trick anyone trying to coerce them or buy their vote). The intermediary has no way to break the first three guarantees, but they can do one of two nasty things:

1. They can prevent anyone from learning the result at all, forcing the election to be repeated with a different intermediary
2. They can run a trustless vote selling marketplace

This is actually already not that bad, because both forms of attack are highly visible and can lead to the intermediary being quickly replaced. But if we want added security, we can do one of a few things:

1. We can put the intermediary's software code inside SGX, preventing the intermediary's secret key from being used to do anything but compute the result and the proof (thereby preventing vote selling) as long as EITHER (i) the intermediary is honest OR (ii) the SGX works
2. We can use [multi-party computation](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/12/26/secret-sharing-daos-crypto-2-0/) to turn the intermediary into an M-of-N system, so you can choose eg. 10 participants where 5 of them would need to collude to stall the election or run a vote selling marketplace

[MACI](https://github.com/appliedzkp/maci) is an implementation of the above (though without MPC) and is being used for quadratic funding via [CLRfund](http://clrfund.eth.link/) already. There is also a 20-year-long academic discipline trying to create electronic voting systems, and it has settled on [solutions with very similar properties](https://eprint.iacr.org/2002/165.pdf), except with the MPC already baked in as part of the protocol.

Now, we get to the question that the academic cryptographer might ask: what's the point of using a blockchain instead of just using one of these academic schemes. To answer this, we should first compare and contrast the blockchain-based approach and these traditional approaches. To achieve correctness while preserving privacy, the schemes are similar; the only difference is that the traditional approaches use special-purpose proofs whereas MACI uses ZK-SNARKs. To preserve privacy itself, all the schemes rely on some form of encryption, where a decryption key is secret-shared between N participants. To achieve coercion resistance, basically all the schemes rely on some ability to give third parties invalid keys that they cannot tell are invalid. **But to achieve censorship resistance, the two schemes are different**: traditional schemes piggyback on the same N participants that hold the secret key, whereas blockchain based schemes use a different N - the entire community maintaining the blockchain.

We should note also that while the _current_ version of MACI has the property that the intermediary (or the M-of-N if it's upgraded to a decentralized intermediary) can break privacy, future versions can be designed with more layers of ZK tech to allow a stronger zero-knowledge property, where the intermediary cannot even break privacy; they can only break coercion resistance.

To summarize:

* Traditional schemes: small N (like a permissioned blockchain) for coercion resistance AND for censorship resistance
* Blockchain based schemes: small N for coercion resistance, large N for censorship resistance

Clearly, the second is better than the first. If you are someone in a more traditional academic background, this may not come naturally, however, as you might be used to maximizing the number of things that need to break to _any failure to happen at all_; the idea that 5 units of protection against X and 20 units of protection against Y is better than 5 units of protection against both X and Y is imo systematically undervalued (you can see this bias in consensus algorithm literature all the time).

In particular, a failure of coercion resistance is less bad than a failure in censorship resistance. If some people's votes get suppressed, and they have no way to prove it, this is utterly terrible for a voting system. But if the intermediaries collude and run a vote selling marketplace, then if they do it at scale, this will be publicly known and the vote could be stopped and the intermediaries replaced. So having a small N (smaller cost but less security) for coercion resistance and a large N (higher cost but more security) for censorship resistance is actually optimal! And this is exactly what blockchain based voting provides.

Finally, the caveats:

1. Blockchains need to be scalable for this to be possible. Eth2 sharding (even data sharding alone) is sufficient; its data layer would be able to process all votes for an election with 100M voters in less than 1 day.
2. ZK-SNARK tech needs to improve.
3. The teams that are technically competent enough to understand the above, and the usual teams shilling ""yay blockchain voting!!!1!"" are not the same
4. I strongly oppose doing any of the above at scale until it's very well-tested in smaller contexts (local elections and non-governmental things, eg. quadratic funding in the ethereum community and maybe decentralized social media systems, go first)
5. This all requires average users to have secure computing environments. We as a crypto community should work hard toward this. You can check out Qubes OS, some of the recent open-hardware mobile phones, and other recent work for existing examples, though keep in mind that having it in the hands of geeks and having it in the hands of average users are two very different problems.",positive,0.8818158,168

The first and foremost is trust.  At this point, you will not get people to trust blockchain enough.  We are still in the early adopter phase, and how many of us do not truly understand how this works.  

This is niche knowledge, and when half the country despises expertise, getting them to trust something relatively new that they are not equipped to understand is a losing battle.

Plus, if you choose a public chain, you have to admit to people that the election ballot transactions may be added to blocks created by machines not just located out of the country, but potentially controlled by enemies of the state.  Do you think the average person is going to trust that?

Second, elections are not a trustless activity.  There is a trusted, central authority in each state responsible for conducting elections.  This negates a couple of factors to drive blockchain adoption.

The underlying technologies that enables blockchain could be used to develop a provably secure voting platform that is centrally administered, but which could be verified by outside observers.

Even such a system wouldn't eliminate election irregularities, difficulties, or challenges - but it would shift the focus away from the ballot counting and more to identity and eligibility determination.

We could do something with zk-SNARKS to show that people voted but not who they voted for, but that would also be annoying because there's no way for the voter to verify that the voting app is legit and did not broadcast a tx for the other candidate. Someone could make a virus that would hack the voting app and make candidates broadcast a tx for Candidate B no matter who the candidate actually chose, and the user has no way of checking whether his vote was changed or not.

""Establishing a Federal electoral commission that standardised the procedures for counting paper ballots by hand across the whole country"" is something that has been done in many countries around the world through history. Since the effort of hand-counting of votes is something that scales linearly with the population, hand-counting can be arbitrarily fast.

So we are essentially discussing the trade-off between effort and speed, since for any speed you name, I can come up with a level of effort to achieve the same result using paper.

Then we would still have to agree on the meaning of the term ""**mathematically dispute**""; what disputes would you like to defend against? Being terribly contrary, I believe that there might be techniques to solve a large subset of kinds of problems we use for validating a blockchain. I claim that Scott Aaronson and Terry Tao could have colluded to create a secret oracle in their basement that can come up with alternate blocks for one of the checksums in your chain. I'm not really confident, I only give it a 1% probability of being true, but now I'm only 99% convinced that your blockchain based solution is fair and accurate. I am mathematically disputing your result, though.

You will have to reply that there's far less than a 1% chance of this being the case. So now we've turned the defence of your solution into one where we start asking the limits of Terry Tao and Scott Aaronson's mathematical abilities. This starts getting very fuzzy.",positive,0.8784777,2

15512,2021-09-02,"Been a long time fan of the project, I really enjoyed diving into how optimistic rollup works and reading the docs.

My question:

The validation of the rollup blocks is incentivized by being able to earn stakes from a successful block challenge. However one might argue that incorrect blocks will almost never be proposed and this makes the incentive to validate the Arbitrum OS state a costly and possibly unrewarding affair (especially as the network state grows in complexity and as tx throughput increases).

I've read that certain Dapps might pay their own validators for peace of mind.

However it seems to me that this can turn into a tragedy of the commons where Dapps will hope that other Dapps are doing the (costly) state validation, until no one actually does and an error slips by.

Would it be plausible to instead run a small, less decentralized consensus on the Arbitrum state validation? For example, a small incentivized committee such as the Chainlink Keepers network, or some kind of Proof of Authority involving the biggest Dapps.

Would love to hear some thoughts on this.",positive,0.8623954,15

1. What has been the most challenging (or most rewarding) part of getting to mainnet launch?

2. While developing, then launching, and then coordinating the resources to maintain a permissionless OR is a huge public benefit, how do you see your work here so far and going forward translating into a profitable endeavor (I'm guessing these sorts of conversations mostly have happened with your investors but some detailed clarity would be greatly appreciated!)

3. I see the biggest hurdle to larger adoption of rollups, and even other prominent sidechains of today is the somewhat hairy bridging process. Spending funds to cross the bridge, OR lockup periods for withdrawals, having to manually ""select"" the network you're connected to on a per dApp basis. I think it's a case of ""iykyk"" in terms of navigating the dApp landscape across chains/rollups. So I guess where I'm going with this is I see UX still having a good bit to go before it's friendly to new and less educated users. Do you see this as a hindrance to get traction with users, and if so do you know anyone who's currently tackling the cross-chain/cross rollup UX issues that deserve special attention?

16207,2022-03-03,"As I read the guidance, it doesn’t appear to apply to Ethereum staking if there is no liquidity token involved.

“The activities of lending and staking have been particularly popular uses of Decentralised Finance (DeFi). It should be noted that there’s no statutory or legal meaning of the terms ‘lending’ and ‘staking’ in this context. The lending and staking section of guidance (CRYPTO61000) applies to two types of transaction:

A person (“lender”) transfers the control of tokens to another person (“borrower”). At the time that transfer occurs, the lender acquires a right to demand that the borrower transfers to the lender the control of an equivalent quantity of tokens at a time in the future to satisfy the loan.

A person (“liquidity provider”) transfers the control of tokens to a DeFi lending platform. This type of transaction may be termed “staking” or “providing liquidity”. At the time when the transfer occurs, the DeFi lending platform transfers control of one or more different tokens to the liquidity provider.

The DeFi lending platform has the ability to transfer the control of tokens provided to it by the liquidity provider to other persons (“borrowers”). It will normally do so on terms that mean the borrower has to provide a return to the DeFi lending platform in excess of the quantity of tokens that the borrower initially received. This return, or a part of it, will be passed onto the liquidity provider as their compensation for providing the liquidity to the DeFi lending platform.”

What they term “staking” here is when you transfer your ETH, and receive another token for it. That’s always been a disposal. Think Coinbase, RocketPool, Lido, etc.

Crucially this doesn’t apply to locking up 32 ETH and receiving no token - solo staking.",positive,0.9180659,2

I've been digging into the specifics of different crypto, and thus far in the technology it seems a token can be decentralized OR scalable, not both. 

I'm interested in buying a small amount and contributing by joining a pool for staking, but I would like some peace of mind that what I invest in is truly scalable (and decentralized,  fuck Ripple) and that it won't die due to competition. I don't think Ethereum is going  anywhere but the Ether coin could lose value.

From what I've seen,  though,  Vitalik is quite literally a genius and is very passionate about the real world applications of Ether (and the utility of the Blockchain outside of basic currency). I envision Ethereum eventually replacing banks, lenders, some court processees, notaries, etc.  Quite possibly entire governments, eventually. The implications are astounding as it shifts the power into the hands of the masses.

Also,  how in the hell are so many people invested in Bitcoin when it's so absurdly slow, inefficient, and expensive to conduct practically any transaction? Do these people research first or are they just buying the hype and speculation?

* Ethereum has a bunch of partnerships and enterprise development. This is something that's not easy to usurp.

16447,2021-07-01,"First thing first, you can’t compare the 2. Bitcoin will show highly inflated numbers. To make a bitcoin transaction, you don’t transfer funds from an address to another, you move funds from previous transactions to new ones. if you send 2 separate transactions to the same address, they are not magically merged together. To send them somewhere, you need to individually move the 2 separate transactions, even if they are stored at the same address. It also means that if you have 1 BTC on one address (and 1 transaction), to send 0.20 BTC you need to have 2 outputs; 0.20BTC to destination, and 0.80BTC (minus fees) back to yourself (which will be a new address). This is why in bitcoin you have to worry about dust amounts, transactions with amounts so low that the transaction fees are more that their worth, meaning they can never be used (there’s edge cases here, but mostly this is correct). 

Ethereum is meant to work with contracts. If it worked like bitcoin, it would be far too complex for contracts to track down, at a given time, what one address contains when doing transfers/reading it as that would require rereading the entire blockchain and maintaining states. So Ethereum took care of doing that automatically, so it works more like a bank account in the sense that you move funds from address to address, no fuss. If you need to send 0.20ETH from your 1 ETH address (which may have been filled from 1 million transactions), then it’s just a simple transaction that says move 0.20ETH from A to B without a need to “send back” 0.80ETH.

16529,2022-06-15,"I've long been curious why the monetization of intellectual property seems to be rarely discussed in the crypto space. Purportedly people are developing new technologies -- mostly software -- to solve real problems. In mainstream tech, the most valuable asset any company has is its technological IP. It's how money gets made. 

I almost never see this discussed. If the point of crypto is the technology, why can't I invest in the IP directly -- by buying equities in a company developing their own blockchain-specific IP Into real world applications?  Why do I need to buy tokens that are transacted on blockchains to ""invest"" in the space? I can invest in energy without keeping thousands of barrels of crude oil on deposit somewhere. I can invest in pharmaceuticals without taking the drugs myself, and I can invest in banks where I don't have any funds deposited. 

Another angle to this is just how much of crypto technology seems to be cloned from other projects, without any sort of licensing economy or even patenting going on. 

And the few public stocks that are crypto adjacent are almost all exchanges, running off the shelf brokerage software they didn't write themselves. Their solutions seem like financial innovations (new ways to leverage or collateralize or trade crypto), not technological ones.  Which is fine as a business model, but isn't ""technology"" as such, and investment strategies can't typically be patented as IP anyway. 

So when you tell me buying eth or BTC is ""investing in technology,"" I honestly don't see why that is necessarily true, in any direct sense. It seems more like making bets at a distance from the actual work of making technologies that solve problems. If I want to invest in technology there are hundreds of companies developing software projects where they will own the code and the code will solve problems, or purports to for investors to consider.",positive,0.91954285,7

Oh yeah, definitely, given how cheap distribution is, enough so that other people provided the same distribution or better for free. The problem is Bill wants to fund some work, here creating programs, through the business model of another work, distribution.

If Bill is unable to find a business model to fund his work, it's on him. There are business models for the work he's doing. But he prefers to do it through IP because he knows he can get even more through predatory IP protection.

And then, he blames expected results of his own decisions on end users. He's no different from oil companies trying to guilt trip end users about environmental concerns. Such hypocrisy.

Rather than paying for a haircut with cash now you can first KYC on an exchange, wait a week till you are verified. Then you can send the exchange some dollars. Wait 3 days till they are there.

16793,2022-01-08,"The word ""server"" imo is not very useful in the blockchain context; it combines together a bundle of concepts that are best treated separately. Particularly, think of the following ways that a user could connect to the blockchain:

1. Use a Binance account.
2. Run a piece of code that asks the Infura API endpoint what the blockchain state is, trust the answer. However, keys are still kept locally; the code signs transactions locally and sends them to the Infura API endpoint to be re-broadcasted.
3. Same as (2), but the code also runs a [light client](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/altair/sync-protocol.md) to verify the signatures on the block headers and uses Merkle proofs to verify individual account and storage data.
4. Same as (3), but the code talks to N different API endpoints run by N different companies, so only 1 of them need to be providing honest answers for the connection to be reliable.
5. Same as (4), but instead of pre-specifying N API endpoints the code connects directly to a p2p network
6. Same as (5), but the code also does data availability sampling and accepts fraud proofs, so it can detect and refuse to accept blocks that are invalid.
7. Run a fully verifying node.
8. Run a fully verifying node that also participates in mining/staking.

Currently, only (1), (2), (7) and (8) are feasible, and (7) and (8) are too expensive for most users. Indeed, the whole reason why blockchains are the future of decentralization and self-hosting is not is that running a server that stays online 24/7 is even harder than (8) [if your staking node is only online 95% of the time, you're fine; if your _website_ is only online 95% of the time, that presents a serious annoyance for your users!].

Moxie's critiques in the second half of the post strike me as having a correct criticism of the _current state_ of the ecosystem (where (1), (2), (7) and (8) are the only things that we have working code for), but they are missing where the blockchain ecosystem is going. There's already teams [working](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/pull/2786) on [implementing](https://github.com/uink45/Beacon-Chain-Light-Client-Prototype) (3), (4), (5), and active research on [making](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/pull/2792/) (6) [happen](https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/verkle_tree_eip). These efforts, contrary to Moxie's claim that there's little _cryptography_ involved in crypto (correct about much of what's happening today!), are heavily based on some of the most cutting-edge and advanced cryptography out there: [Verkle trees](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/06/18/verkle.html), [ZK-SNARKs of the EVM](https://ethresear.ch/t/a-zk-evm-specification/11549), [BLS signature aggregation](https://ethresear.ch/t/pragmatic-signature-aggregation-with-bls/2105) and so on. 

As for my theory about ""why this hasn't happened yet"", I would say a lot of it comes down to limited technical resources and funding. It's easier to build things the lazy centralized way, and it takes serious effort to ""do it right"". The Ethereum ecosystem did not have that much resources up until ~4 years ago.  Of course, ~4 years ago, the ecosystem did start to have a lot of resources, but new projects are slow to ramp up, and the centralized workarounds have had years of head start. One thing that makes the ramp up even slower is the chain of dependencies: in order to have light clients, we need to have a light client friendly chain, which is a deep change to the protocol, and so the only realistic opportunity to implement it is the switch to PoS, and we're only now at the point where we have the PoS, and full integration with the merge is coming soon. Fortunately, the dependencies are being attacked and resolved one-by-one, and there has already been a lot of progress! Once the general-purpose hard legwork is done by a few dedicated teams, building trustless applications will become much more feasible for all dev teams, that would just need to plug in the libraries.

So I think the properly authenticated decentralized blockchain world is coming, and is much closer to being here than many people think. Of course, it's always possible that all this tech will get built and many people will not care. But I'm more optimistic. Users generally accept defaults given by developers, and many developers really do genuinely care about decentralization and trustlessness (and growing legal issues with running centralized points of trust will push them to care more). Decentralized options that users reject today (eg. running a full node) really are quite difficult today, so it's understandable that users are sticking to the more centralized options that at least they can easily use. None of the proposals outlined here are anywhere remotely as difficult, and even running a full node itself will get easier and cheaper over time as ideas like statelessness and history expiry come into play. So I see no technical reason why the future needs to look like the status quo today.",positive,0.6921561,431

>A protocol moves much more slowly than a platform. After 30+ years, email is still unencrypted; meanwhile WhatsApp went from unencrypted to full e2ee in a year. 

TCP/IP wasn't the best protocol, but it had the magical ""It works"" + adoption. When it wasn't good enough, it simply changed. Sure, there was debate's and concerns, but what average person remembers that? Now we have enough addresses to accommodate growth with IPv6. These **protocols move slow because they work**, and people are busy doing things on top of it. **Demand for change, creates change**

Most email _communication_ is encrypted. The demand (or value) for encrypted email messages are not high enough for it to be adopted. There's better systems to accomplish the goal (e.g. ""Why are you putting _that_ in email?""). Email is still needed - just for different use cases than it was 30+ years ago. For organizations or individuals that need to encrypt email - they simply encrypt them using easy to use features that are already built. 

The examples of centralized API's, OpenSea, MetaMask are all valid points, I personally just view these as transitional phases, or onboardings. You can be critical of how they're transitioning, but that's what it is - a transition. Ethereum impresses me because it continues to evolve while not only maintaining the network effect but growing it's adoption. The more adoption, the less agile you become. But change is still obviously happening.

16802,2022-01-08,">As it happens, companies have emerged that sell API access to an ethereum node they run as a service, along with providing analytics, enhanced APIs they’ve built on top of the default ethereum APIs, and access to historical transactions. Which sounds… familiar. At this point, there are basically two companies. Almost all dApps use either [Infura](https://infura.io/) or [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) in order to interact with the blockchain. In fact, even when you connect a wallet like MetaMask to a dApp, and the dApp interacts with the blockchain via your wallet, MetaMask is just making calls to Infura!
>
>These client APIs are not using anything to verify blockchain state or the authenticity of responses. The results aren’t even signed. An app like Autonomous Art says “hey what’s the output of this view function on this smart contract,” Alchemy or Infura responds with a JSON blob that says “this is the output,” and the app renders it.
>
>This was surprising to me. So much work, energy, and time has gone into creating a trustless distributed consensus mechanism, but virtually all clients that wish to access it do so by simply trusting the outputs from these two companies without any further verification. It also doesn’t seem like the best privacy situation. Imagine if every time you interacted with a website in Chrome, your request first went to Google before being routed to the destination and back. That’s the situation with ethereum today. All write traffic is obviously already public on the blockchain, but these companies also have visibility into almost all read requests from almost all users in almost all dApps.

Oof, the state of Ethereum is even worse than I thought.

>What I found most interesting, though, is that after OpenSea removed my NFT, it also no longer appeared in any crypto wallet on my device. This is web3, though, how is that possible?
>
>[...]
>
>Again, like with my dApp, these responses are not authenticated in some way. They’re not even signed so that you could later prove they were lying. It reuses the same connections, TLS session tickets, etc for all the accounts in your wallet, so if you’re managing multiple accounts in your wallet to maintain some identity separation, these companies know they’re linked.

That's not how it works. That's how it's used, and what it does. Also, typo on seamlessly.  
 
So how does in work? Do you have bullet point list of the technical implementation? That is way more important imo

This is a really interesting request, but unfortunately it's not something we currently offer. Most new features and improvements to Coinbase come directly from feedback like yours, so it's very valuable to us. I've recorded your request so that it can be reviewed by the product manager when planning which features to build next.

I created these NFTs as digital gifts for patrons who participate in a drawing I am holding to win an original art piece. Creating a digital asset seemed like a fun and creative way to further engage with my supporters, whilst also speaking to the times we’re in with blockchain technology. I am more or less a lay person when it comes to all of this, but I do know we’re going to continue to see NFT/digital assets proliferate not only the current crypto communities but also industries at large. 

I wrote an article, [here](https://app.voice.com/post/@stacy/how-i-turned-my-artwork-into-nfts-1612053988-50948770), where I discuss using my NFTs as gifts, and as ways of further engaging with my patrons—and, potentially even other communities in the future. I did throw a few up in a marketplace to experiment, but giving gifts to my supporters is the objective of my project. I plan to include them in future projects as well. 

The buying and selling are only a couple aspects of NFTs.  They can be used in games, as collectables, for trading, artwork, community building/DACs, to vote, as engagement incentives, rewards, and the list goes on.

Right now, we appear to be in a bit of the Wild Wild West with NFTs. Many, such as myself, are curious and want to play around. I also saw what I thought was a fun opportunity to spread the energy of pro blockchain architecture and engagement. I’m also a content creator on Voice, one of the social media platforms running on a blockchain (in this case, EOSIO). 

I think all of this is the future being created now, and it’s exciting and full of possibility/potential. I look forward to learning a lot more about all of this, perhaps from some of you!",positive,0.9180421,7

Their goal is to distribute it worldwide through their PI app (where you earn a bit each day by just checking in and verifying the network and also helping to build it).  Once they have enough users, they move into the next phase where it can start to gain value through market action.  If you’re interested in mining it, sign up and use rwalkerc03 as your referral code, and you’ll start gaining 20% more than the baseline amount and starts you out with 1 PI.

You start off gaining about 4 PI per day.  FREE.  Potentially FREE money if it takes off!  It doesn’t ask for any banking or credit card info.  I just started 5 days ago and am up to 60 PI.   Just download the “Pi App” from your phone and use rwalkerc03 as your referral code!",positive,0.9087835,1

Well through the power of blockchains and cryptography, you could have real proof of authenticity and a series of transactions of the picasso recorded on the blockchain.

17406,2021-02-01,"nfts representing ""art"" are easily forged / copied. rabi is a erc20 project for nfts and there is some custom art i saw on there going for 10k, a gif. i could just copy that.

nfts are just unique tokens nothing more, nothing else can be the same. fungibility is a property of money and is inheritenly important to how cryptocurrencies work. e.g. bitcoin 1 bitcoin should be as good as another bitcoin but thats not true. all utxo in the bitcoin blockchain has a history. you could for example get some bitcoin that was used in a darknet market, a government agency might label these coins as dirty, this has occured.

so thats where NFTs come from, a clear distinctiion from something that is not fungible i.e. unique and not reproduceable.

the value of nfts really comes from tokenising real world assets like say a sports team. you can give shares via erc20 tokens to divide up something regular ppl could not afford in a single ownership.

consider a siutation where someone wanted to sell the monalisa and give shares in its ownership you could represent the painting with an nft erc721 and use the [ERC981: Partial Ownership Standard](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/981) this allows you ot mint erc20 tokens for fractional ownership.

We can agree they exist.

Looking at the 2 options listed at the end, the first one (""proposer pays burn"") seems to me like it would end up reinventing the second option (""average final basefee across txns""), unless I'm missing something.  

Assuming ""proposer pays burn"":  If ""basefee+tip"" transactions require calculating basefee, it would need to be determined somehow. And since you can't know gas used until after evaluation, it can't be determined ahead of time except by a bounds / estimation method -- such as the approach used in option 2.

This mechanism seems elegant economically, but algorithmically, a lot of the difficulty it adds seems to be coming from fact that basefee is no longer a function of prior blocks, but also of the block that's undergoing assembly.

edit: It does seem like the ""estimation"" part could be turned into a client-specific bit that isn't part of the protocol (much like some of the mempool ranking algorithms) -- it doesn't affect the final end result that protocol would enforce (""basefee has to be paid""), and would allow clients to experiment with different estimation approaches (e.g. if you underestimate gas by doing ema() of prior utilization, have to reassemble block, with max-gas estimate as final fallback).",positive,0.9178643,4

`2^x ~= (1 + 2/3 * frac(x) + 1/3 * frac(x)^2) * 2^floor(x)`

Where `floor(x)` is the largest integer `<= x` and `frac(x)` equals the fractional part `x - floor(x)`.

Some example values:

| x | 2^x | Approximation |
|--|--|--|
| 0 | 1 | 1 |

It's very simple (it's basically `1 + 2/3 * x + 1/3 * x^2` from 0 to 1 plus an infinite number of appropriately shifted and scaled copies of that same function glued together), and it's very smooth (it's continuous and differentiable, which is the most smooth that a piecewise degree-2 function can be). It's also extremely accurate: it's always within 0.5% of `2^x`.

For `e^x`, unfortunately such a nice approximation does not exist; `e^x ~= 2^(x * 0.6931471805599453)`, but the fact that `e` is transcendental means that `e^x` has no rational points except `(0, 1)` and so can't make a piecewise function without a tiny bit of error.

The Warsaw Stock Exchange together with KGHM intends to offer an innovative way of investing in silver. The undertaking is still waiting for the adoption of appropriate regulations.

- We would like to offer a silver tokens. On the one hand, KGHM will keep the silver magazine all the time, that is, it will be an investment in physical silver, which will be able to go to the magazine and pick up in the form of a staff. On the other hand, it will be very easy to conclude transactions through Blockchain technology. We hope that it will be a processive improvement of how you can become the owner of investment silver - said the president of the WSE Marek Dietl in an interview with the ISB agency, carried out during the Congress 590.

The initiative is to be part of the GPW Private Market project, under which the Polish Stock Exchange intends to develop solutions based on Blockchain technology. Widely on this topic Marek Dietl spoke in the May pulse section ""Puls Biznesu to Listen"".

As he added in the statement for the ISB agency, the head of the Stock Exchange, tokens on silver will be offered to investors only after the adoption of a package of legal changes, first at EU level, and then in Poland. Speech on Digital Finance Package package, which the European Commission adopted at the end of September 2020.

- A lot depends on European regulations, we can not do this before they are implemented in Poland. We count on, however, that during the year these regulations should appear, and we are in a large part of it, so without charging by dates, in two years it should appear on the market - added Marek Dietl.


The subject of investing through the WSE in physical metals of the precious president of the Stock Exchange raised in last year's interview for Bankier.pl.

- It also seems that you can talk about raw material ETFs, with the possibility of physical delivery, eg gold or silver. We are currently collecting experience from the agricultural market, where we also had to combine online from offline, take care of logistics, warehouses, etc. - he said.

KGHM is the second largest producer of silver in the world. You will also learn more about this article ""KGHM is not only copper. Such a Polish giant produces silver and gold. ""

Crypto shares none of those attributes.

Crypto also depends on a very elaborate computer information network that is very expensive to operate and maintain.  One large enough solar flare could render the Internet offline for who knows how long.

Where can you find ways to give a human readable name your wallet address? Where were self repaying loans developed etc etc.


Almost all the other chains that claim more scalability are just more centralized. Which is a sacrifice many in the crypto community are not willing to accept. 

It's also worth considering that with ZK Rollups and Data Sharding the TPS on the Ethereum ecosystem will be able to out-compete competitors by orders of magnitude. At that point what advantages will they be able to offer? And if you understand that's going to happen, and can already use some rollups right now, why would you consider a less secure, more centralized alternative?

17597,2021-12-01,"I think you're making a couple of classic mistakes

1. There is an adage - first time founders think product, second time founders think distribution. Distribution is in many ways more difficult to overturn than simply having a better product. You're seeing it yourself - there are indeed blockchains that are \*cheaper\* today...but the movement off of them is not nearly as pronounced as the TPS  differential they promise.
2. Distribution also results in more product market fit experiments in blockchains. We say crypto is really innovating...truth of the matter is, is that beyond DeFi, NFTs and ICOs, there has been 0 product market fit. Scaling solutions and infra don't count. The case for ETH is also a networks case - more distribution -> more developers -> more pmf experiments -> higher likelihood of the next innovation.
   1. This is less proven, but one can make the argument that distribution is a function of decentralization.
3. I would encourage you to read this post [https://medium.com/starkware/redefining-scalability-5aa11ffc5880](https://medium.com/starkware/redefining-scalability-5aa11ffc5880), which details why L1s currently aren't really scaling. There is a hardware reality here that is inescapable. Chains will need L2s. Zk Rollups are not trivial to implement and therefore there is a tech + distribution advantage that ETH has in the medium to long term.
4. Institutional awareness. ETH + BTC still have a large lead here. Don't underestimate how risk averse institutional money is. Crypto is likely the ""junk bond"" proportion of a mutual fund's allocation because of volatility.

There is another point that gets repeated over and over, but I'd like to add another spin on it.

ETH fees are high because of demand.

Flip the way you look at it.

Generally when you see folks use what you perceive to be a shitty, second rate product, it's a good indicator that that product is solving a deep enough pain point that people would rather use it **in spite** of its shittiness.

Note that no one is saying these advantages are insurmountable. Hedge your bets like a smart investor.

> 
> The term central bank digital currency (CBDC) refers to the virtual form of a fiat currency. A CBDC is an electronic record or digital token of a country's official currency. As such, it is issued and regulated by the nation's monetary authority or central bank. As such, they are backed by the full faith and credit of the issuing government.1 CBDCs can simplify the implementation of monetary and fiscal policy and promote financial inclusion in an economy by bringing the unbanked into the financial system. Because they are a centralized form of currency, they may erode the privacy of citizens. CBDCs are in various stages of development around the world.2

* There is a Automated-Market-Maker on their L2 (Uniswap-like experience).

**Cons**:

* Currently not immune to censorship like L1 (Loopring runs the relayer and could choose not to include certain transactions).
 * I don't think they have ever done this, but it is a real possibility.
* Initial onboarding to L2 and withdrawal from L2 is significantly more expensive than a simple L1 transaction.

The transactions and fees occur on the blockchain.

 Hmmm? 

A.  I could fund my E bay purchase through my bank via PayPal,  for the total price plus tax, so... $100 + ($100\*.06) =$106

OR...

B.  I could buy it with a greater # of trust actors by a method of using my bank to fund a cryptocurrency purchase which I could then trade back to fiat and pay an extra fee, so... \[$100+($100\*.06)\]=$106, then $106+($106\*.023)=$108.23...

Suppose WoW was built with NFTs, I would imagine it to work something like this:

-The game has you login with your wallet. Your wallet essentially acts like an inventory and the game monitors what is in your wallet

-When you obtain a weapon, they mint an NFT of that weapon and send it to your wallet/inventory

-You can sell items you’ve earned or buy items from someone else on say, OpenSea

-For every transaction for an item the game dev gets a cut

Would it not be possible to end Steam’s dominance in the future by allowing those licenses to be resold at a benefit to all parties involved including the developer? For example, let’s say I buy copy of X game for $10. Good game. I get through it in a couple of days and want to make a couple bucks back to buy some other game. I sell my license of the game, and the blockchain distributes the profits from that sale to all parties involved in making the transaction successful. Now here is the kicker, each time that license changes wallets, it loses inertia (I don’t know what to call it, fuel? Gas?) until eventually it can no longer be sold. The percentage of profit distribution changes to the developer’s favor each time, with less piece of the pie going to the seller. This rewards the developer more and more each time. When that license can no longer move, a new one is minted and given to that person at the end of the chain, so that he or she now becomes the next supplier of that new license. That distribution resets, and the cycle repeats. The digital supply of that game is finite at any given moment. What happens then? Will we hold on to that copy because it’s value will increase over time, and when seller meets buyer developer also gets chunk of profits?

The projects that typically do the best are responsible for writing novel code to Ethereum. Quality NFT projects are successful because the engineers/earlies appreciate them. Thus the NFT craze is really an enthusiasm for the network, paired with those at insanely different economies of scale, with a lot of participation from those for whom 100Eth, just isnt all that much. (Another commonly missed point, is ""fuck your norms, fuck what used to be important, fuck disney, fuck the corpos, this is what's important to us"" mentality)

You have to actually venture into the space and participate to truly understand what NFTs have done, and are doing on a larger scale. Through NFTs, DAOs have been able to experiment and practice rapid formation, assembling massive community funded treasuries in less than an hour, along with boilerplate (lol) governance and diminished trust choke points. The amount of focused liquidity a new DAO formed around a project can provide is a force, and has no rival in tradfi/corporate/traditional ventures when it comes to rapidity.

Other great things for which NFT enthusiasm is mostly responsible: Wallet UI/functionality advances Novel/Composable network additions (code legos) Advances in NFT usage in DeFi/collateralization Minimalist (efficient) focused engineering (for on chain projects)

I see it as an intrinsic problem of the scale of social network monopolies. The management at services like Youtube, Facebook, TikTok, etc. are driven (and constrained by their obligations to investors) to grow their systems while maintaining a certain financial configuration. This leads to social networks attaining such a colossal scale and magnified audience engagement effect that it becomes impossible for them to effectively deal with scams and misinformation campaigns. You'd think that they'd be able to do better with machine learning, but then the scammers and political campaigns have incredible incentives to develop counter-measures. This particular kind of ecosystem can't get rid of its toxic parasites.

""Erin Brockovich"" does help address horrible pollution. ""Occupy Wall Street"" does help address corruption in finance and government. But IMO reform efforts often can't sufficiently heal systems that suffer from ""can't not be evil"".

18673,2022-11-02,"hey, not sure how much you know. heres one real world example.

In essence, imagine you want a loan and you have some assets. lets say you have $20,000. you want a loan of about $3000.

through defi, instead of going through the bank, you can take a loan _against yourself_. and you can do it all from your home at your computer. this is called a collateralized debt position or a CDP. you can take more or pay it off at any time. you might read this and ask, why would i need $3000 if i already have 20k? but realize that you can hold that 20k in any currency (like ETH). and if you think that currency will appreciate, then you want to keep your holdings, and a CDP allows you to keep your bag but also use it as an asset to get liquid money today.

 the mechanisms to guarantee this functionality with security is very complex, check out MakerDao and the relationship between MKR and DAI. but understanding it is not needed to use the tool, just like any other technology.

the future of this is, different defi platforms will then compete for customers by offering the lowest interest rates. then we can remove this financial middle layer, of people being required to facilitate secure handling of money, so that can stay in our pockets instead (lower interest rates because we dont have to pay people salaries to run the ""bank"")",positive,0.93088096,35

If you have money locked in the network through staking, liquidity, smart contracts earning interests and it's working for you, why would you move to another chain to save $50 on a contract that moves 100s of thousands? We are talking whale transactions. Small fish just hodl or time your moves to be as effecient as possible for now.",positive,0.90603113,3
18785,2021-08-28,"You are discussing Ethereum and its gas issue as if Ethereum is a finished product.  The reality is that Ethereum hasn't even really been turned on yet.  For all it has accomplished, it is still in beta form.   In fact, the entire crypto space is very, very young, and Ethereum is on the absolute cutting edge as far as development goes in nearly every aspect.  Ethereum frequently solves global-level blockchain industry problems that benefit all other blockchains, and the trilemma and user interface issues you allude to in your post are no different.

Yes, the gas fees as they currently stand are unacceptable.  The community does recognize this issue, and it is why gas fees are being heavily addressed by multiple parties in multiple different ways.  This is no different than any other major technology development cycle.  It is also a problem Ethereum faces because it is the only major blockchain even attempting to solve the scalability trilemma at scale.

With regard to L2's and the general usage patterns of Ethereum in the future, I believe you are wrong and that history can easily offer examples showing why.  The crypto universe of today is already much easier to use from a user-standpoint than even a few years ago.  Mount Gox was a joke compared to what exists now.  Buying garbage coins on Idex was atrocious compared to how easy it is now.  Going back further, Hotline servers were awesome compared to what came before them back in the 90's, but they sucked compared to the ease of use Napster, Limewire, or any modern torrent-based system.  User interfaces improve...  it happens...  people use technology every day without understanding the underlying protocols of their smart phones, cars, or radios.  

When the time comes, people will use L2's easily and often without even knowing they're doing it.   In some cases, they will use systems without even knowing it was built on top of Ethereum.",positive,0.6947653,5

19033,2022-10-28,"AWS has offered a similar service for a couple of years. The thing is, nobody actually wants this service.

Services like Rivet.cloud and Infura offer RPC gateways where you pay for requests and if you need more requests you pay for more requests, and they take care of high availability, load balancing seamlessly across nodes (which is non-trivial when nodes are syncing data over a peer-to-peer protocols) and and a number of other factors. AWS and Google cloud handle none of this. They'll run a node for you, and if it goes down they'll replace it but you'll have an outage for a bit. If you need more requests volume than one node can serve they'll put it behind a load balancer for you, but they won't guarantee that a request routed to node 2 is serving the same block as a request routed to node 1. If you're running an application that needs scale and reliability you're way better off with an RPC gateway than a managed node.

If you're trying to support the network by running a node, managed services are definitely not the way to do it. The network has a problem with the percentage of nodes run in a small handful of service providers. Running yet another managed node does nothing to help that.

I don't think AWS or GCP will manage staking nodes for you, and that's pretty much the last thing that would make managed nodes worthwhile.",positive,0.7267311,2

I have nice amount of ETH but what I did wrong was buy ETH on 2 different popular platforms.

Maybe it's better as the popular advice is to not have all your crypto on what platform for obvious reasons.

The reason for this was because the last platform I used where I bought a significant amount of ETH depositing required no fees for the transfer of funds to buy.

I have staked the larger amount of ETH for 2.0 which is now locked, that am fine with, also have staked most of coins for passive small income.

Going to leave the other ETH where it is, am in it for the long term anyway.

The reason being, there are tons of extremely wealthy people in crypto. A portion of people that got in early in BTC and ETH are loaded, and to them, dropping a few hundred K, even a few million, is probably only a tiny percentage of their net worth. They could be investing in some of these early projects and hoping they'll be worth more because the earliest projects tend to be valued higher.

Does it make sense? Not really. But in the real world, there are also people that will pay insane amounts of money for a real Picasso. Similar to the real world, it's not all for money laundering.

My point is yes, you could use NFTs to launder money, but there are way easier ways. Like real art.

but anyway, NFTs are hot and are here to stay even if they don’t provide any value. it’s not like dogecoin or safemoon has any real use case/value so what makes it so different it from an NFT?

19341,2021-07-13,"I think we've seen something pretty unique, during these past two months. 

If you look at the ETH price in BTC (for instance in coinmarketcap), there's been a 100% increase in something between May and July, with a lot of pressure to buy ETH in exchange for BTC. And we could feel some sort of flipening effect, back then. It was big. 

Then, not long ago, the pressure suddenly stopped and some big whale was reported moving their ETH funds out of some CeFi platform. 

So, to me, what we've observed is one or more big BTC holder(s) slowly converting their funds into ETH, probably believing the next few months would be deeply transformative for the Ethereum network in comparison to the Bitcoin network's slow pace.

I think it was an interesting move, because if other whales follow suit, they will have to follow with a bigger trading cost or wait longer for the buy pressure to cool off, all while knowing there will be a period when it will be too late to wait.

I'd expect some other whales to follow and the buy pressure to come back, at least once they realize the effects of the August EIP and the certainty of getting the formidable consequences of PoS, so between August and December. 

Like the gold rush, except that it will be the fuel rush.

That said, development is always full of surprise and drama, so I also expect wild uncertainty at some point along the way.

19496,2021-02-02,"Ethereum is a platform to build infrastructure that allows society to scale trust in an anti-fragile way. This infrastructure can be manifested in financial markets, governance, or other models. As societies scale new forms of handling coordination are needed. Ethereum represents a new form of doing so in a world shaped by a globally connected internet.

Ethereum allows the manipulation of value, which allows the management of risk across people and time to preserve and build capital. Be it social, financial or cultural capital. In the financial sense, the programmable modeling and manipulation of value allows for the recreation of finance which solves age old economic needs. 

Since it’s programmable, Ethereum can model any subset of traditional financial applications, and expands what is possible to a greater unexplored superset of value manipulation activities. Unconstrained, Ethereum allows new types of “games” to be played with money, say a system where for every transaction, the supply increases quadratically. Contact with the real world will make some unexplored games and new types of markets more useful than others.

A manifestation of this is DeFi, decentralized finance, where modern financial activities have been commodified and modeled on the network. Open, permission-less modification allows for rapid experimentation leading to new types of in the unexplored superset, financial applications like flash loans, no loss lotteries and quadratic markets.

This is a great podcast which also defines crypto economics which is the basis of the network:
https://youtu.be/ycK3AUTdl1w

Crypto economics can be defined as the usage of cryptography and economics to ensure trust minimized systems. Note there is probably a better articulated definition than this. 

When you can use cryptography use it. If cryptography cannot assure security properties, go a level up and use game theory and economic incentives to ensure collaboration. A common application of this is using cryptography to ensure the gardening of the blockchain. But using economics incentives to incentivize consensus of which is the correct chain aka the correct objective reality. Cryptography can give assertions in stateless world, but once time is introduce and state is necessary, we need consensus to all agree on what happens in the next state transition.",positive,0.9268545,15

* It is important because you use it to run protocols on Ethereum

* Benefits of holding: holding and not using, the economics suggests that the value of ETH can increase

* Potential of it: look at the amount of money and growth rate of users and money deposited into the ETH network as a whole, more people are using ETH to transact. Also, more institutional funds are allowing people to invest in ETH as an investment product

L1 is the main Ethereum blockchain. Everything done on it needs to be processed onto the blockchain. The people that do this, miners, are in short supply, so the price of getting stuff done on L1 has skyrocketed.

L2 is simply a fancy queueing system, an autopilot that holds your process in place until it can be processed on L1 as cheaply as possible. Problem is, each website/organization has it's own L2 system. So if you use L2 you're stuck on that website until the thing is processed on L1.

Think of the process being dirty laundry and the website is doing the laundry for you. Instead of you paying to use the machines there-and-then, they hold it for you until the price of the washing machines is cheaper and/or until you need it cleaned ASAP.

19632,2021-03-05,"Optimism rollups won't work for everyone. Most DeFi devs  prefer using ZK rollups over Optimism. 

This article quickly explains the reasons why: https://medium.com/starkware/the-optimistic-rollup-dilemma-c8fc470ca10c

Also: 
>Optimistic rollups have a withdrawal delay of one to two weeks during which time a transaction can be challenged by providing fraud proofs.https://www.trustnodes.com/2020/10/27/defi-consensus-forming-on-zk-rollups-for-ethereum-scaling

Vitalik even admits ZK rollups have an edge or Optimism:

>In general, my own view is that in the short term, optimistic rollups are likely to win out for general-purpose EVM computation and ZK rollups are likely to win out for simple payments, exchange and other application-specific use cases, but in the medium to long term ZK rollups will win out in all use cases as ZK-SNARK technology improves.https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html

So he's aware that Optimism we'll ultimately lose out to ZK rollups in the end.  However Optimism is able to do EVM Smart Contracts, ZK Rollups are limited to simple transfers for now. Which is probably why Vitalik recently proposed, using cross-rollup solutions: https://ethresear.ch/t/cross-rollup-dex-with-smart-contracts-only-on-the-destination-side/8778 .  This proposal would mean that in the short term, most devs will use a hybrid of  Optimism and ZK Rollups; until ZR-SNARK tech improves.

People wrongly think that things like gold and oil have inherent value. They do not. Their value comes from institutional adoption. Ether now also has institutional adoption. When it acquired that is when I became comfortable with it and bought.

Gold is a metal. If governments, jewelers, banks, etc. didn’t say it had value, good luck trying to give it to your neighbor in exchange for food. He’d say “a shiny rock? No thanks.” Oil, likewise, may have utility in combustion, but that utility will start “drying up” as we move away from combustion economics.

In that sense, ether is backed by as much as these far more “traditional” asset classes, yet it also has higher utility prospects.

One thing to note here... since your rewards are valued in the above-mentioned tokens, during times of downward volatility, they will likely crash harder than ETH in value.

As far as I'm concerned, Ethereum is currently the most technologically advanced cryptocurrency in existence and they will continue to technologically improve as the industry advances with their highly skilled team of developers... But the truth is, just as we've seen many semi-clones of Bitcoin when it was considered the most revolutionarily technologically advanced platform, is that the Ethereum network is not irreproducible or even (obviously) improvable. The very nature of open-source software makes it so. 

This fact, coupled with a lot of the shadiness and collusion some have pointed out between the Ethereum Foundation and whales/big investors, makes me nervous about it's future as a highly decentralized and community governed coin. In no way do I doubt it's long-term success as an investment, but I do have my doubts about it's ability to live up to crypto-principles like decentralization, democratic governance, and accessibility. That said, there's plenty of Layer One cryptos being built today that offer all Ethereum does (minus their enviable user volume) without all the patchwork scaling solutions. In other words, although Ethereum is undeniably advanced technologically, I don't believe it's the best and final iteration of cryptocurrency.

My transaction definitely looks the same as you: My Polygon-WETH was sent to the null address with the `withdraw()` call (same as you), but on the Ethereum side on I got all that ETH back with an `exit()` call, initiated by me on that second step where the bridge asks you to switch MetaMask to mainnet and sign another transaction

So I think you're missing the second `exit()` call on Ethereum mainnet. From my understanding the Polygon transaction burns the WETH and issues a receipt that gets sync'd to mainnet that lets you withdraw the actual ETH to mainnet with that `exit()` call. Maybe there's been an issue with the UI that didn't let you initiate that second transaction from mainnet.

20069,2021-08-15,"I was wondering why the average gas fees seem to have nearly doubled just after the London hardfork even though (in my approximation) the amount of TPS should have gone up slightly. 

I'm glad that you did this research. I was trying to figure how the TPS should be affected post London and I figured that the TPS should increase slightly because blocks used to 'only' be able to have a maximum of 15M gas and there were always pending transactions so this would mean (I assume) that every block that wasn't mined empty should have been full since miners have the incentive to fill a block and collect the fee. 15M gas used. Almost any two sequential blocks should average to 15 M gas used. ((15 + 15)) /2) = 15M

But now we have a little fluff room that allows for a block to be 30M. Yes, the fee will raise in response to this, but the next block is almost never 0% full after a 200% full block is mined (probably because people submit transactions after the increase in base fee has been calculated) ((30 + 4) / 2) = 17M. (The 4 is just any arbitrary number higher than 0)

This seems to me that the gas of any two sequential blocks averaged together post london should almost always be higher than any two sequential blocks mined pre London. 

My two questions now are, why are some empty blocks mined? And is this just anecdotal evidence that fees are higher now, or did the number of transactions increase by the ratio of the gas fees?",positive,0.7872257,32

But it seems they're not always doing that, they emit a block with little gas used and then one block later another miner takes all those transactions that weren't included and emits a block with close to 30M gas used.

For example, there are only 20 transactions above a basefee of 28 gwei, so if the block's basefee is 28 gwei, only 20 are included and the block goes relatively empty. However, in the next block, the basefee falls to 25 gwei, and suddenly there are hundreds of transactions between 25 and 28 gwei that can now being included, so the next block is full.

So, if you want to play banking games you will have to abide by their rules/laws.    

The problem is most people are not using cryptos like they were meant to be used. Instead they just want to play bankster speculative games in order to make more fiat. So the issue is really self-inflicted.    

If you don't want a small group of entities (ie. banks) to have such control... then use cryptos for p2p purposes.    
Stop all this insane de-fi products that are based on debt driven profits, which is exactly what got us in the mess in the first place.   

Greed is the only reason people want to play these speculative games.    

Using crypto for what it was intended which was to get rid of 3rd party intermediary entities having to be involved in transactions, will mean we get rid of banks and similar entities.    
Perhaps not 100%, but their their influence and thus power will be significantly reduced.    

But, most people will not change, they are only looking for quick money making schemes and only thinking of the short term.",positive,0.82691586,12
