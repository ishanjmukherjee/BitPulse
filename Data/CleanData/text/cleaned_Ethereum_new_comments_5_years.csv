I think we can, it's just a matter of setting up the framework of guidelines to adhere to, and thousands of parallel LLMs cranking up code generation, unit tests and cron jobs doing periodic testing and comparing of generated code versus the current established performance metrics. Embrace AI, automate everything. We humans just need to watch, observe and select, for now, eventually that too will be entrusted to algorithms, but depending on the perspective, that's still a while off :)

And of course, there remain research items that we're still having a crack at, but lets also invite LLMs to reason about blockchain protocol issues. It can. And no it's not perfect. But it *can* reflect on feedback and input from *all* accepted data streams, unlike human egos who tend to consistently avoid confrontation with how far we've already come lol. It's can be a rough realization, admitting higher intelligence to something that doesn't even care to pretend to be human.

My point is that research and development of a protocol can be automated if you setup a proper map, guidelines, a backbone for the current LLM tech stacks to reason around. Then it's just a matter of setting up the needed feedback loops to analyze, model, predict, simulate and compare results. Until eventually it settles on a set of pieces of code that interfaces with each other and has been optimized for all measured metrics of concern such as decentralization factor and redundancy.

But few people love to work on making their own work obsolete. We love to feel relevant. Needed. And we are. But it shouldn't have to be about writing code anymore. Leave that too up to technology. We can, and should, focus more so on setting up the feedback loops so that we can try out more solutions and not waste time on code generation, but on selection of outcomes instead that already have been tried and tested by thousands of LLMs trying to attack, crack, break, push the limits of all the newly generated (contract) code by other LLM instances.

We live in an attention economy. Narrative is all that matters (price follows narrative, narrative follows price).

To target smooth brains like me and those with one wrinkle :

1. ETH Intern  twitter/X handle that can blast out simple positive narratives and make fun of FUD would be a start. Given the advances in ai bots this could operate 24/7. If successful, expand to other social platforms.
2. Never mention the other chains by name but instead in vague terms (e.g. FTX VC coin with high inflation dumping on retail). This policy was very successful in BTC subreddits in the past when they felt threatened by ETH and consistently removed any posts that mentioned ETH or only allowed it be referred to as “No.2 coin”. 
3. Don’t mention the tech. 



To target both smooth and wrinkled brained financial media staff and ETF investors:

1. Have one spokesperson that is a very effective communicator that knows KISS (keep it simple stupid) and how to reduce the complex to the simple. In the beginning Ethereum did have a very effective Community Coordinator, who was an excellent communicator (Vinay Gupta) and Gavin Wood when he was at Ethereum was not shy talking at financial conferences or to news media.
2. Keep Bloomberg staff and other financial media informed (e.g. on X EricBalchunas, JSeyff, NateGeraci) who report on crypto ETFs and counter FUD sent their way.
3. Expect the USA ETH ETF issuers to update the filings to include staking in 2025 to provide yield and be ready with the kiss - e.g., ETH is digital gold with yield and apps.
4. Have a USA focus as it is the largest financial market in the world.
5. Don’t mention the tech.

Now that the SEC has dropped the ETH investigation and approved ETH ETFs it would be counterproductive for the Ethereum Foundation to not do targeted marketing given the $100M yearly spend. It is nearly 2025 and US politics have turned crypto friendly and if you think that competition in the attention economy is going to get any easier - it ain’t, not with ai as it exists even without the coming gai.",positive,0.92587143,12

Given the mainstream success of Polymarket, I believe the two most impactful use cases for crypto would be building a **credibly neutral social media platform** and creating [**tamper-proof media**](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1gkrnmn/daily_general_discussion_november_6_2024/lvsxwij/) to verify the authenticity of images and videos from trusted sources. While Bluesky's use of domains as handles allows for verified subdomains and helps address verification issues, true long-term neutrality and transparency would be better achieved with blockchain-based solutions.

Integrating these would allow users to build profiles where their reputation and credibility are tied to their verifiable web3 activity.

Bitcoin can't run programs on chain. When you trade 1 BTC for 90000 USD, the moment BTC left your wallet should be the moment USD enters your wallet, no intermediate state.

There are lots of ways to do it that are all sensible for reasonable holdings (hot or cold).  I think it's not a horrible idea to just split it in two addresses (seed phrases) regardless.  Just like using two banks.

Of course if that SHTF scenario is an apocalypse, or a large scale EMP attack, etc - I don't think crypto will be useful.  If it's govt action or bankruptcy collection etc - then it works.

Those will probably become standard tech for everyone to know in a decade bc of their applications across other fields.  I think knowing a little helps you make investment decisions a ton also.

I would steer clear of this wallet. For your scenario, you should simply stick with a hardware wallet or if you're going to use Coinbase or Kraken, it's fairly safe just to leave them there. At least until you're getting more familiar with how it all works. 

The most important thing for you in this situation, is that you understand crypto transactions are irreversible. The place where most people who don't understand crypto mess up, is by sending all their funds to an incorrect address, or they transfer all their funds to their hot wallet without realizing their computer is infected with malware which then steals their crypto. 

I would suggest you spend a few hours getting familiar with the hardware wallet. After setting up the device, wipe it clear and see that you can reliable restore the same account using the seed phrase. Make sure you do not write down the seed phrase on a computer or phone, and do not take a picture of it either. Only write it down physically and store it somewhere safe. And make sure you add a ""25th"" word, which might be referred to as a ""password for the account"".

I would also suggest you spend some $10-20 making a bunch of $1 test transctions before you try to send large amounts, to make sure you understand exactly how to send transactions. Maybe the first time you purchase crypto, get $50 worth and just play around with it and then make a larger investment when you feel more confident.",positive,0.85336834,2

Everything revolves around your wallet seed phrase.  What makes things like Ledger and Trezor nice is that the seed phrase is generated offline and you can be sure that it isn't compromised unless you do it yourself.

I recommend a mix of hot and cold wallet for easy of use. 

Get a ledger and keep your funds there. The only outgoing txs from the ledger should be transfers to a hot wallet where you do your onchain interactions. A separation of church and state kind of thing.

Also, once you generate the seed phrase for your cold storage, it should be stored physically in a safe way. Depending on how much wealth you are storing, a safety deposit box might be reasonable.

Ethereum does not have a centralized entity controlling it, so the only mechanism to stop or censor transactions is to 51% attack the network, which is prohibitively expensive.

Starting with a banger to the question What is money?

> Money is classically defined as a store-of-value, medium-of-exchange, and unit-of-account. Money is a social coordination tool—an intersubjective reality used to organize economic activity. There have been many monies used throughout history including cowry shells, Sumerian ledgers, silver, gold, the British Pound Sterling, and the U.S. Dollar. Money isn't necessarily a binary—assets can have degree of moneyness. The moneyness of an asset increases the more it is used as money. Generally, the strongest monies are those with the highest saleability and liquidity in the largest economies, and those that can preserve or improve their purchasing power over time. ETH is emerging as a primary money for the internet economy.

Next, you aren't staking ""within"" either metamask or trezor.  Both of them are routing you to a third party and profiting off of the referral.  You should skip the middleman and go directly to the third party.

The easiest way is to purchase and hold a Liquid Staking Token (LST).  By purchasing the LST, your funds get used for staking by a third party and most of the profits get returned to you.  This is all secured through smart contracts so they can't steal from you.

One of the most reputable LSTs is rETH (rocket pool staked ETH).  They use home stakers (which decentralizes ethereum) and the large bond by node operators means that they are one of the most protected from slashing events.  Also there's a discount on rETH right now.

You can use a decentralized exchange like uniswap or cowswap to swap your ETH for rETH.  Then all you have to do is wait, and your rETH will increase in value over time until you want to sell.",positive,0.91130924,7
275,2024-11-15,"As has already been said, both Consensys and Everstake run a lot of validators, leading to centralization in the Ethereum validator set which is not great.

I've already seen Rocket Pool mentioned in another comment, that's a much better choice.

There's another option that lies somewhere in the middle - StakeWise. They have a marketplace of non-custodial Vaults, many of them run by mid-size node operators with a competitive fee structure. Minting an LST (osETH) is purely optional there. It is quite similar to native 32ETH validators, with a Vault in the middle that pools depositor ETH and splits the rewards between the depositor and node operator. All smart contracts went through multiple audits and the V3 system has been live for a year now without any issues.

On a related note, there's a good chance that Ethereum will introduce Anti-Correlation Penalties which will actually make centralized staking options more prone to lose rewards, see this talk from earlier this week at Devcon - https://app.devcon.org/schedule/DKTUMD .

With all options, be very careful when searching for them on Google, there's often phishing sites masquerading as ads in the results. I would encourage you to go with an option that is better from a decentralization point of view.

Edit: If you're worried about slashing penalties with the mid-size operators, it's good to know that as of the next network upgrade (Pectra, likely Q1-Q2 2025) these will be massively reduced, from ~1ETH to ~0.0078ETH.",positive,0.8499181,2

Here are some considerations:
1) Yield: everstake takes a 10% cut of your rewards. Compare that to whatever metamask’s partner does
2) security: technically, all your trust will be on everstake not trezor. Everstake has been audited and is reputable, but understand the risks.
3) reliability: see how much slashing has occurred between your options 
4) centralization: everstake I think is one of the largest providers when it comes to staking. Some have raised concerns that they are too big and thus using them risks the decentralization nature of ethereum. Might be true, but once the requirements to stake individually is reduced to <32 ETH I think this concern goes away so not a huge concern to me

It's like the fallacy of saying your crypto is stored in your hardware wallet... common shorthand, but of course it's stored in the blockchain and just your private key is ""stored"" in your hardware wallet.

Thanks for the info on rETH... i've seen Rocket as an option in Metamask's liquid staking providers.  I chose stETH on Lido at the time as there was a higher return rate being offered.

I believe they also take 10% (between metamask and Consensys together).  They have a few partners for liquid staking that lets you stake amounts smaller than 32 ETH you need for validator staking.  I currently use both options via Metamask, Consensys validators when i can put up 32Eth or a multiple of 32, and liquid staking with whomever is offering the highest return on the metamask platform at the time I stake the small amounts.

The following is true:
- L2 scaling is working 
- ETF inflows are net positive 
- Blob space is being used up enough to trigger auctions resulting in net negative issuance
- Coinbase, the American crypto success story, is crushing it with their Base chain metrics

303,2024-11-15,"For as long as bitcoin is leading, I won't be comfortable holding any position in this market. It'll need to be flushed out. That could mean another halving or two before its security budget issue becomes apparent in practice. In the meantime, the entire cryptosphere will continue to seem like one big joke. 

Except for Ethereum, but the joke there is that public perception is still just as important, while the public just wants their bags pumped asap, ignoring all the holes in it. If anything, crypto is further highlighting all the issues with humanity. People hate being wrong and love being right. Whereas for the sake of one's personal growth, it should be the opposite. Being wrong means potential for growth. Being right means your ego gets further inflated into your growing echo chamber.

It might just be that Ethereum is still undergoing too much change in order to take bitcoins position, who's only remaining value proposition is that it *won't* change. Perhaps this raises the hope that Ethereum can ossify before the bitcoin incentive structures crumble. But there shouldn't be a hurry either.

The market can be irrational for longer than you can remain solvent. I don't see bitcoin ATHs as a good thing. I see it as a growing issue. For when reality does come knocking on the door, it'll hurt all the more people.

I've ranted on this before, and I question my motivations for mentioning it again. I like to believe I'm doing it to hopefully save others from financial surprises. But maybe I'm just mad at how long it takes for people to educate themselves, and frustrated with the reality of how most people only seem to learn when it hurts. But that's perhaps just human nature isn't it?

Keep playing and exploring the yard, until it unexpectedly hurts. Feel the pain, cry over it, reflect, think, grow, learn. And do it all over again. Except, in the crypto world, you're typically your own guardian. No bank looking out for you. (and profiting of your ignorance)

But the sharks are still there, directly profiting of your gullability, selling you the next ICO or other investing variant thereof. If I learned anything from all of this, is that marketing works. And that's something most companies already knew and profited from for the longest times.

Ethereum in that sense has this noble idea of trying to refrain from marketing. And in a way, it's very fitting. The tech speaks for itself and needs no marketing. Just like Linux doesn't. Regardless, I'm happy to see the change. The ticker is ETH.",positive,0.80417675,18

Another way to look at it might be that as long as Bitcoin is leading, there's more potential upside for Ethereum? Anyway I don't really agree with the sentiment. It's easy to become disillusioned with Bitcoin and there are some big question marks, but it's only natural that Bitcoin would lead the way. I don't think it really matters anymore. Bitcoin is gaining serious adoption on it's own, and that's great, but so is Ethereum. And in many ways ETH is in a much more comfortable position imo. While it's true to some extent that ETH is competing for the digital gold market, that's really the only area where the two networks compete.

[EIP-7716: Anti-correlation attestation penalties](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7716) 

Does anyone see any drawbacks to it? It seems quite straight forward:

We basically increase penalties for validators that miss attestations simultaneously, which indicates a centralized setup, while lowering penalties for solo stakers.

Larger staking pools face increased penalties for correlated behavior or they are forced to diversify their set up, which brings their profit margins down, discouraging users from staking with them, which would likely lead to users exploring alternatives and increasing diversity. Looks like a win-win to me.

What happened with the merge was that the users upgraded to software that said, ""after the time X *, I will use the proof-of-stake chain to decide which block is valid instead of the proof-of-work chain"". 

Some miners did oppose this happening, and there were a couple of other attempts to get users to run a version of the software that didn't make the switch to proof-of-stake. But hardly any users wanted to run this software, and everybody considered the ""ETH"" on the proof-of-stake chain to be the real ones and the ""ETH"" on the proof-of-work chain to be a (very minor) alternative coin. Since the token on the proof-of-work chain was hardly worth anything, most miners stopped mining it.

The “obscure technical reason” was that a specific block number (“time stamp”) could have been gamed by miners, but cumulative difficulty could not.

518,2024-11-13,"Hi guys, 

I'm interested in buying 1 eth. I have never been into crypto before and I'm usually a steady dollar cost average into VTSAX/VTIAX person. 

I'm a software developer and know lots of people who have invested in crypto before but I don't buy single stocks and crypto kind of seems like buying an individual stock so I stayed out of it. But I would like to have a little. 

My goal is to buy 1 eth and put it in a hardware wallet. I've heard ""not your keys, not your coins"" and it's obviously true. Then I just want to keep it safe. I plan to keep 1-2% of my portfolio in crypto and just hold it.

You can pick between a hardware wallet or like a browser/app wallet, either way you will 100% control the keys. There are tradeoffs in security but either way you'll be fine as long as you safely store your backups somewhere.

Once you have the wallet set up you can withdraw from the exchange and you're set. The exact steps to get it set up will depend on which method you use, I don't have an article handy that reviews them all unfortunately. Make sure you set up 2FA (pref through google auth/authy not sms) and whitelisted withdrawal addresses on your exchange account.

Also if you want to keep things really simple you could just buy some ETH on Fidelity and forget about it. I think the not your keys not your coins risk is a little overzealous as a blanket policy. For some people and situations it's totally fine to leave it on an exchange.",positive,0.9286614,8

525,2024-11-13,"Arthur showed a poor understanding of that point. And you are right to emphasize it. There is two different markets, the market for ETH and the market for blockspace.

A very high ETH price does not necessarily translate to very expensive blockspace. Blockspace prices can go down to 1 Wei. If blockspace is very expensive use cases move somewhere else. Non-native ETH economy is sensitive to high GWei, and it moves away if it's too expensive in USD terms. 

Why would then happen that ETH is expensive while gas fees are cheap in GWei terms? Very simply because ETH has acquired monetary premium. This occurs if the demand for ETH surpasses its ""industrial"" use as a commodity. Like it happens with gold. What's its ""industrial"" use? To feed the EVM to settle computation on Ethereum.

So if there is demand for ETH in excess of the burn (""industrial"" use) then the following things happen:
- ETH gains value and acquires monetary premium
- Gas fees are cheap in GWei terms. 
- ETH becomes slightly inflationary, still capped by total issuance.

In fact, ETH being slightly inflationary is one and the same with ETH acquiring monetary premium. Mathematically is the exact same thing. And this is the main thing that the ultrasound memeist got wrong. When ETH is acquired above its ""industrial"" use levels, necessarily becomes inflationary. This is just the reflection of being more buyers of ETH to use it as a Store of Value than people burning it.",positive,0.7898396,13

Degens was an early pioneer for a while but development stopped. Had all factors you describe except on mainnet.

There's others today, but their names are escaping me as they aren't particularly popular. But it's been attempted plenty.

The hard part with being fully decentralized is you need reliable oracles that NEVER make mistakes. While it's easier with sports, it's not trivial. Even ESPN has wrong data from time to time. Then you also need market makers to provide liquidity, typically via API with a line maker. No one wants to waste their capital on a new site with no users. And a user won't use a site with no liquidity.

Then there's mistakes. When a normal sportsbook does -100 instead of -1000, they just cancel your bet. Can't do that if it's decentralized so there's a lot more risk.

A potential issue you will probably run into is latency which means you will be posting stale odds if you are doing any sort of live betting.

I know Chainlink does have live data streams for trading crypto pairs, so you should be able to build out a live data feed for a sports game.

While DeFi obviously has tremendous potential, it hasn’t hit mainstream yet. inFi can start providing people with “news” and predictions probably more quickly than even Twitter / X since there are opportunists out there scourging the Internet for breaking news to tip the odds in their favor. 

One thing I expected Vitalik to comment on, however, was the issue of insider info. Predictions for who HBO would claim is Satoshi, for example, gave tremendous opportunity for those involved in the film and within HBO to make tons of money. Even for less direct situations such as opening weekend box office predictions, the studios’ FP&A teams already have internal forecasts, Wall Street consensus numbers, and will have Actuals coming in probably hourly from theaters.

710,2024-11-10,"Tldr: almost certainly a scam, not worth it even if it isn't

There are 3 important parts of an Ethereum wallet. 

1. Public Address
2. Private Key
3. Seed Phrase

Public address is safe to share and that information holds no real value. It's like a one-way bank account number. Anyone can put what they want into that address, and anyone can see what the address has in it, but you cannot take anything out or move anything with just the public address.

Private Key is like your bank account password. You need to have this in order to take money out or move any assets in a wallet. It's the ""write"" part of read/write access.

Seed Phrase is the set of words that are fed into an Ethereum algorithm that are the source of privacy for your wallet. In fact, the Seed Phrase *is* your wallet. You can make many Public Addresses and Private Keys from a single Seed Phrase, but each address only has one Seed. You can go into MetaMask and create a new ""account"" as many times as you want, but that's just making new Public Addresses.

Okay so I am explaining all of this because, 1, you should know this going into crypto, and 2, what they want from you depends if it's a scam or not.

If they want your Public address, then that's fine and that part isn't a scam. 

What they are likely asking for is the ""write"" portion of rights because they will need to move things out of the wallet to actually make trades.  The private key or Seed Phrase. Never give these to anyone, and don't save them digitally anywhere. Pen and paper only.

The scam is they take advantage of people not knowing how a wallet works, and you essentially just give them your money. It's not complicated, it just preys on people's ignorance for the lack of a better word.",positive,0.8370082,2

This is an important step in the right direction and very welcomed. The report is also very clear, well-written, gorgeously editted. So props on that.

What I'm missing... This report should be published rigorously on a pre-defined schedule. E.g. twice a year or yearly. It's not OK to go a couple of years without it, then publishing again, then go silent. The inconsistency raises suspicions, even if nothing nefarious is going on.

The target allocation of the treasury should, more or less, be defined programmatically and rebalancing should be done automatically to maintain said allocation. The EF should not be seen as playing market timing, which is often accused of, likely unfairly. But again the issue is lack of transparency. If the target allocation is pre-defined and publicly reported, selling ETH is just a non-event part of maintaining the treasury where it needs to be for day to day funding. You cannot completely prevent FUD but you have a much easier way to disprove it.

In summary, more transparency is critical. The EF should not only be credibly neutral (towards the market, ecosystem, etc...) and ETH aligned, it should also be perceived as such.

So thanks a lot for this but I think the EF can still do a bit better with minimal effort.",positive,0.8720436,4

> You could ask the exact same question about the Internet. A neutral base layer gives an opportunity to build neutral apps or at least switch between the vc hustles. Dont fall for the psyops.

BTC is a greater fool game. The average investor will make a loss equivalent to the amount spent on mining over the duration of the scheme, which is an immense amount of money. Additionally many early investors have already cashed out at a profit, and those profits can only come from the losses of later investors, so that would be you.

ETH are valuable: The average investor can reasonably expect to make a profit over the long term.

I don't have an opinion about current prices (I know that's what you really need to know, sorry) but basically SOL vs ETH comes down to: 

1) Do you need a very decentralized base layer for what people actually want to do? See [my other comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1gksl7u/daily_general_discussion_november_06_2024/lvtc88q/) on this.

There are currently over 1 million ETH validators, creating a highly resilient network. The only way for ETH to die is for all 1mm+ of these to spin down. It's realistically not happening.

SOL validators are currently subsidized through network inflation. They're not profitable on their own through network fees and the Solana foundation has to pay them to stay up. If SOL can't maintain profitability of its token its likely that validators would spin down because of a lack of profitability since they're so expensive to run.

843,2024-11-06,"Ethereum supply is elastic, it changes depending on volume. Supply growth is currently approx 0.4%/year. Calling it ""infinite"" is just lazy rhetoric imo.

Price is just a matter of if buy pressure outpaces sell pressure.

This is more of a problem with BTC because sell pressure is high because of miners' electricity costs, and requires more buy pressure than ETH to make the price go up.

SOL inflation is around 6-7% and equally requires more buy pressure than ETH does to make price go up. For example the overall market cap is around all time high levels but the price is lower because there's a greater supply.

Of the three, Ethereum requires the least amount of buy pressure to make the price go up because of the elastic supply dynamics and the fact that it's validators create much less sell pressure than the other two.

Price prediction forecasts are useless mostly. But I wouldn't fade ETH now that it has the ETF and the sitting President of the US has his own DEFI platform on Ethereum and will replace Gary Gensler with a pro-crypto SEC lead.",positive,0.7577109,3

In contrast the fees and MEV collected are (mainly) not transfers from ETH investors, they're transfers from Ethereum users (people minting their monkeys or whatever). 

Even if you don't stake the ETH you hold this year, the ETH you're holding can be staked by you or someone you sell it to next year, and the value of the ETH you hold now depends on its revenue over its whole lifetime.",positive,0.89875084,3

Then when you pay for something, that portfolio distribution will be liquidated accordingly based on what you preselected, for the amount needed.

Right now we cannot do this because we don't have 24hr markets, and brokers/banks are not interoperable to allow this sort of automation to happen. There is literally no reason why your net worth should not be always and continuously invested and liquidated as needed.

Hi everyone!

Recently I started diving deeper into the tech side of crypto.

One of the first things that I'd decided to read was Ethereum Whitepaper and Mauve Paper.

Mauve paper caught my attention: it's only 6 pages long, but reading it was so hard that I've spent 6 hours digging it with GPT.

That's why I decided to create a website where you can learn how PoS works (accroding to Mauve Paper) in an interactive way: from becoming a validator to finalising a block and more.

**Here it is**: [tim-sha256.github.io/ether-pos/](http://tim-sha256.github.io/ether-pos/)

It's open-sourced on GitHub: [https://github.com/tim-sha256/ether-pos](https://github.com/tim-sha256/ether-pos)

Please note that it's better viewed from a desktop.

I also wrote a post on why I decided to create it in the first place:

[https://medium.com/@tim.sh/why-i-created-ethereum-proof-of-stake-demo-3e469ecfbe8e](https://medium.com/@tim.sh/why-i-created-ethereum-proof-of-stake-demo-3e469ecfbe8e)

I made it entirely using AI: used GPT 4o as a project manager to help form technical requirements and Cursor as a coder. I literally wrote 0 lines of code (though it took me longer than I expected).

Hope you find it interesting and / or even learn something new!

Let me know any feedback (including bugs, mistakes made...) in the comments - it's my first pet project, so there definitely should be room for improvement.

931,2024-11-02,"This doesn’t work, here’s why:

1) Price impact - the $ amount needed to buy up 51% would increase dramatically as you started to buy up UMA to flip a vote 

2) Front runs - say you successfully buy up 51%, others would front run you for sell offs and you’d lose money on the UMA you bought 

3) Emergency mechanisms - there are mechanisms in place to prevent a 51% attack, both on UMA and Polymarket 

4) Polymarket override - Polymarket can in this case overturn the result of a market 

5) Non-compete assumption - on your way to buy 51%, it is more than likely that the top whales would accumulate more UMA to hold bigger shares, and so your amount needed goes up again 

6) Circulating supply - there’s not that much liquid UMA between available on the market, it’d be a hell of a challenge to even be able to buy that much

7) Open Interest - volume and open interest are different, there are nearly no markets that have a higher open interest (liquid) than 51% UMA 

8) FDV/OI fragmentation - this assumption also rides on the single person / group being both the better and holder of UMA, placing the bet, buying the UMA, triggering a dispute, and voting to pass their option, there are likely little to no market where one person is holding that much at stake 

9) Common sense - do we really think that UMA and Polymarket haven’t thought of this? Do we really think if it were that easy it wouldn’t have happened? 

10) Other avenues - there’s SO many other avenues for making money (and even essentially scamming money) around prediction markets that don’t take this much work, capital, or chance, especially because it wouldn’t work and you’d lose your money.

What's particularly tricky about it is that there are rich people who want to make it look like Trump wins even if he loses and they're prepared to spend money doing this. For example Elon Musk is going around pushing debunked conspiracy theories about Dominion voting machines. Other people have pushed the same conspiracy theories and been successfully sued for defamation, so he's clearly prepared to spend large sums of money to make people believe Trump won the election even if he loses. This kind of thing is really hard to design around in crypto-economics, because although your protocol can calculate how much open interest there is in a market, you can't calculate how much somebody cares about creating a media narrative.

It wouldn't be weird if the plan was to bet on Trump, which will create a success narrative in itself because you'll move the price in his favour, then if he loses, attack Uma.

PS The assumption here is that Uma is actually decentralized. I don't know anything about the actual token distribution of Uma; A lot of systems that nominally decide things by a vote of tokenholders (with or without some other mechanism like a schelling game) are basically trust-based systems in disguise, because the team and their investors hold most of the non-dormant coins.

""Tokenization in the Treasury market will likely require the development of a privately controlled and permissioned blockchain managed by one or more trusted private or public authorities""

They're actually arguing that public blockchains aren't suitable.

It's nonsense:

* Technology choices: Public, permissionless blockchains use complex consensus mechanisms (e.g., proof-of-work, proof-of-stake), making it difficult for them to process large transaction volumes efficiently
* Operational Fragility: These blockchains rely on decentralized nodes with no centralized authority, which leads to vulnerabilities
* Governance Gaps: Public blockchains lack clear governance structures, which increases the risks of system failures or bad actors taking advantage
* Security Risks: The decentralized nature and lack of vetting in public blockchains increase the risk of bugs, exploits, and attacks, as seen in historical cases of vulnerabilities being exploited in Bitcoin and Ethereum
* Money Laundering and Compliance Issues: Public, permissionless blockchains allow for anonymity, which can facilitate illegal activities such as money laundering and sanctions evasion

OK, then explain this:

Major apps like Uniswap are now redirecting to the Coinbase Smart Wallet. But I've tried to use it a weekend ago and I wasn't able to complete a swap on Uniswap. It just simply doesn't work, the swap button turns to ""Confirm in wallet."" An endless spinner. I tried this with iOS 18, iPhone 14. No success. That's a basic phone and operating system.

Also, it is using AA and K256 signatures. I almost recommended it to a friend of mine who wanted to buy an NFT on mainnet. Well thank god we didn't go through with it. Had I sent her money on L1 there, I'm not sure if it would have even reached her as K256 signatures can only be cheaply evaluated on L2s from what I understand. An ETH transfer was between 100k-300k gas: [https://optimistic.etherscan.io/tx/0xb496bfa620d6144a356527898890df92cd7bf310a12a3d289b9a8fbe06669697](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/tx/0xb496bfa620d6144a356527898890df92cd7bf310a12a3d289b9a8fbe06669697)

Coinbase is irresponsible here. I actually agree with you that most people don't wanna think about gas and seed phrases. I think the Coinbase Smart Wallet is really interesting and truly a way to break free from iOS and Android. I support it! But just launching an alpha product to everyone is unacceptable. They should have launched it when its ready and they should have done it gracefully.

Edit: Btw the K256 curve is only supported as a precompile in a contract now. Many dapps are also relying on EIP712 signatures through the regular curve. In fact, my app and others heavily rely on EIP712 signatures. But, to my knowledge, nobody is ready to accept K256 curve signatures. So I can assure you that CB Smart Wallet won't be able to connect to my app without me doing a major upgrade. Many such cases.",positive,0.8705526,3

Does Number of Roll-ups equal number of L2s? In a futuristic scenario I don't see why there would be demand for more than just a handful of L2's. (Companies could create their own L3, like Blackrock I guess, with KYC, and more control).

1105,2024-10-31,"It seems really obvious that the right solution is to offer as much scaling as cheap as possible. The main reason behind the burn mechanic isn't to make ETH more scarce and pump people's bags, it's to have a cost associated with making transactions so that stakers can't make free transactions and circumvent ETH to drive value to their own token and prevent validators from pushing up transaction cost at no cost to themselves to extract more value from users. 

Of course everyone can appreciate that more ETH burned = price goes up, but it's really not that big of a driving factor. ETH gained the most value at times when inflation was much higher than it is now, before any was getting burned, it should be obvious that demand from *use* is a much larger factor. Personally I think it's a shame that the burn has ended up being this sort of appeal to the lowest common denominator where we end up in a situation where people are turning against cheap transactions because they want to pump the price. 

I honestly don't know if hardware/bandwidth requirements is a big factor in this, that might be a fair argument against, but I haven't seen anyone express this. All I hear is that ""L2s are parasitic"" which is nonsense. That's literally how Ethereum is supposed to be used, and if this is a use case that offers a lot of value, like clearly we've seen with the success of Base, then we want to see as many ""Bases"" as possible live on Ethereum, that's what's going to drive real value and ultimately lead to more ETH getting burned anyway.",positive,0.86870384,2

Yeah sure I agree with that. I'm just hoping this happens organically from a ton of use, rather than making design decisions to generate value. The value lies in capturing a big market.

>Sure, so far it hasn't had much of an impact but it's good for narratives and hype. Also the bigger the burn, the larger the impact to where you can see it as a driving factor especially as the price grows.

Here I strongly disagree. I don't care about hype and narratives, I think this plays a part short-term, but doesn't mean anything (or at least very little imo) for *adoption*. Contrary, I think it would come at the cost of integrity and credibility if we make network decisions based upon ""what will increase the price"". 

I do think it's important to have a sound monetary policy, to have ""minimal viable issuance"" wherever that lies, and I also agree that it's important ETH captures value, in part for the security of the network, but also as a sound investment and a much better digital gold than BTC can be. It just has to come about the ""right"" way. We shouldn't stand in the way of improvements based upon how it affects the price short term.

>I hope that's not directed at me because I haven't said that. It's just a natural aspect of the economics/perception.

It wasn't directed at you no.

[https://etherscan.io/gastracker](https://etherscan.io/gastracker)

It looks like your wallet allows you to pay for gas in USDC, so its probably some sort of Smart Wallet (AA Wallet). These typically take significantly more gas to make a transaction than an EOA (normal Ethereum account). Your transaction was cheap yesterday because you made it from a normal EOA wallet.

Your wallet also might not have great defaults for the gas price you are making your transaction with. There should be advanced settings to change gas price and see the gas limit of your transaction. A simple ETH transfer is 21,000 gas, and a swap can be more like 50,000. I'm curious what is says the gas limit for your transaction is?

Edit: If it is a smart wallet transaction they should definitely provide some warning about potentially high fees on L1 and its kinda shitty that they make this hole so easy to fall into. It's not recommended to use smart wallets on L1 unless you're transacting with very high values that need the extra L1 security. I'm also curious if the thing you were trying to pay for could only be paid for on an Eth L2, or if mainnet was the only option?

Edit: If you are able to pay for gas in the native token (ETH) instead of USDC that should save you a considerable amount of gas. You can also set an alert for when gas prices are low to save a few more bucks",positive,0.91461575,5
1124,2024-10-30,"Never heard of trust wallet, but a quick search shows people complaining about it and ridiculous fees. Looks like it's a closed source wallet. Are you able to export the private key from it? From what I've quickly gathered from their site, you can. I would do that.

So, I would export the private key and load it to something more trusted like Metamask, MyEthereumWallet.

In terms of gas fees, if you go on Etherscan, gas fee is around 13 Gwei, which works out to be around $0.71 to send ETH on mainnet.

Edit: looks like you're trying to swap. I just checked Etherscan, swap fees are around $13 on mainnet. On L2s its around $0.04 for transfers and $0.18 for swapping. Looks like Trustwallet might be funneling you through their own provider and taking the difference.

1181,2024-10-30,"Blob space is a separate block space for L2s to use for data availability. There's currently a limit of 6 blobs with a target of 3.

Under 3 blobs the cost L2s pay are low enough to be considered free. In Pectra, the next upgrade, the blob limit and target will be increased further. This is to keep momentum with adoption of blob space by L2s. By raising the target, blobs will be ""free"" for longer to give smaller L2s a chance to grow and increase their user activity which would help distribute the cost of blobs amongst more users once the blob target is reached and enters a fee market again.

Because of blobs being ""free"", blobs are often fudded for being a horrible decision because it's giving away resources for free and hurting the chain's fee revenue. This is why L2s are also being called parasitic. This is often a claim made by VCs of alt L1s and competing projects that are having their users stolen by L2s because of cheaper fees.

However, this completely ignores what happens after the blob target is reached. Blobs enter a fee market and go into price discovery. While it's not much when it has happened recently (couple ETH burnt per day) with the current amount of blobs and throughput, things get pretty crazy as usage grows.

Tim Robinson made a simulator for blobs to better show what this looks like: [https://ethereum-blob-simulator.netlify.app/](https://ethereum-blob-simulator.netlify.app/)

A near term 10k tps would end up burning a couple percent per year, boosting fee revenue and making ETH deflationary again (current inflation is \~0.7%).

When you adjust the number to look at the long term scalability targets of Ethereum (100k tps), 15,000 ETH would be burnt per day. Given the current supply that's \~15% of supply burnt over a year, and would increase year after year as supply decreases.

1186,2024-10-30,"I'm excited about Impermax. Uh oh, I made the same posts 3 years ago and nothing good happened to the token. But this time, It Will Be Different. 


First, the protocol itself is worth using regardless of the token. Deposit LP without leverage to get autocompounding for nearly free (2% fees), or lend single assets. While the Scroll airdrop left some disappointment, I didn't feel a thing because for months I was earning 15% average APR there on straight ETH (that ETH being borrowed from wstETH/weETH collateral on Aave, I was still getting marks too). 


Incidentally, the main DEX Impermax was supporting on Scroll, Tokan, collapsed in the past days - in the sense much of their TVL was tied to yet another one of these ""stablecoins"" backed by a native token. *funny* how these things happen, after airdrops. 


So from the Impermax side, it's time for a move to Base. In truth most of their TVL was already there, because an elusive whale deploying millions to farm fBOMB loves using Impermax to max leverage his LPs by borrowing on the ETH side.  


In a general manner, it's interesting how a protocol can almost find product market fit by serving a single person. Then, depending on design, that person can encourage more permissionless use.  i.e. here the whale leveraging leads to high ETH APRs for lenders, and Impermax users have entered a curious game of chasing the whale where each week brings new incentives to Aerodrome/Velodrome fBOMB pools, and a move in kind by the whale. 


I wonder if we'll see more Ethereum protocols deliberately built in such a fashion in the future. Instead of traditional dynamics where you either provide excellent service to the ultrarich, or just mere good quality to masses of people, smart contracts and their implied composability offer the potential to do both at once. Any pattern where you can target high value individuals with a core need and have the counterpart of their need be provided permissionlessly by regular people sounds like something worth exploring.",positive,0.90461737,7

Makes sense - people love a chance to speculate and only Ethereum can deliver a truly fair, trustless, and transparent lottery.

So, after going down the rabbit hole [(you can read more about that here)](https://paragraph.xyz/@mrwitters/how-a-random-reddit-comment-led-me-to-build-a-lottery-on-ethereum), I’m thrilled to say… the low-hanging fruit is now humble pie.

Essentially, I've carefully picked some of the most reliable bull run indicators and put them all in one place. Every metric on here serves one purpose: helping you figure out if the bulls are finally back or if we're still hibernating with the bears.

What you get:

* Price action for BTC/ETH/SOL with historical comparisons (7d, 30d, 90d)
* Market dominance tracking (is BTC still king or are the alts gaining ground?)
* Quarterly Crypto VC data showing total deals and investment volume (is it crypto funding winter or summer?)
* Google Trends data (are normies searching ""bitcoin"" again?)
* Coinbase app ranking (tracking retail FOMO in real-time)
* Fear & Greed index with key values and historical averages (because emotions rule over degens)

Everything is automated except the VC investment data (which I update manually because degens need fresh hopium).

No signup required, and no ads, just charts and vibes where you can focus purely on the trend.

price increase Coming Soon:

* M2 Money Supply tracking (money printer go brrr?)
* More suggestions from you degenerates

This is just v1, and I'd love your feedback. What other features or metrics would help you ape more intelligently? What features would make this your go-to dashboard?

I knew about zero knowledge proofs and fully-homomorphic encryption already, but \*\*indistinguishability obfuscation\*\* is an insane new cryptography primitive I'd never heard of before.

Basically, iO lets you encrypt a program in such a way that someone can run it, but can never figure out the program's internals no matter how hard they try to analyze/decompile the program.

More on iO, according to Vitalik:

\> While it's still very far from maturity, as of 2020 we have theoretically valid protocols for it based on standard security assumptions, and work is recently starting on implementations. Indistinguishability obfuscation lets you create an ""encrypted program"" that performs an arbitrary computation, in such a way that all internal details of the program are hidden. As a simple example, you can put a private key into an obfuscated program which only lets you use it to sign prime numbers, and distribute this program to other people. They can use the program to sign any prime number, but cannot take the key out. But it's far more powerful than that: together with hashes, it can be used to implement any other cryptographic primitive, and more.

My understanding is that with FHE and iO combined, theoretically someone could create a program that operates on encrypted data, where the program is itself encrypted. And both the program and the data remain encrypted during the entire operation. So the program and data are both protected from the computer that is running it and storing it.

Increase demand at a greater rate than supply. All of your proposed policies only focus on the supply side. To increase demand, we really want a fairly stable price and lots of cool ways you can use eth cheaply. Bitcoin's guaranteed scarcity is ultimately the cause of its wild up and down swings in price (imo), ultimately making it more like a virtual commodity than the virtual currency it was supposed to be.

This equation is the same as Ethereum in POW and for Bitcoin. If each BTC fell to $1 tonight the network would become unprofitable to mine, miners would cease, and the network becomes insecure.

>What Bitcoin has gained strong supporters for now is the guarantee of scarcity.

There is no guarantee of scarcity of BTC. Bitcoin derives its security from new issuance, as does Ethereum. Halving issuance algorithmically over time is a fundamental problem for Bitcoin and in no way guarantees anything about its future. BTC being capped at 21M and not uncapped to continue mining is the biggest lie in crypto... Ethereum does not share in this fundamental problem, and I appreciate it doesn't play short-term games at the expense of longevity or usability for simple meme status.

>Burn all fees including MEV

If MEV was something the network could 'grab' MEV wouldn't exist in the first place. If $ABC is $5 on GMX and $1 on Uniswap someone buys all the Uni tokens and sells them on GMX bringing the price to be equal at both exchanges. Most MEV is beneficial to our markets and isn't something the network should just yank from a users wallet for no good reason or there's no incentive for MEV and Defi breaks.

>Set the total issuance to 100 million, and stakers only get the fees.

Then stakers unstake and the network becomes more insecure.

For what again? So ETH doesn't have 1/4 the rate of inflation BTC does? I don't think that's actually a real problem.

I think a more clear proposal would be something like reducing the issuance curve slightly, by like 5-25%, since ETH probably doesn't have to be quite this secure.

The problem is that you also need to think about all these cases adversarially, it's a nightmare.

And that's for new contracts and doesn't start on the problem that the existing contracts weren't designed with the assumption that you need to do a whole load of security analysis on whether someone can DoS honest users by maliciously bloating state, so you're making a load of stuff that was built securely with no admin backdoors insecure.",positive,0.5476575,1

I see how it would be somewhat of a bitter pill to swallow for existing contracts to introduce rent on contract level. But they wouldn't stop working. They'd simply be not ideal and expensive to keep up. But it would give everyone time to migrate to a new contract model. Ethereum is still small enough to do such a change now.
In that new model the complexity of paying for a contract would be handled by the contract itself. I'm a smart contract dev and I think it would be totally fine to program a dapp with that in mind. There would be the possibility for users to add to the rent balance and some contracts could revard them in some way for doing so (e.g. some kind of token inflation for token contracts). But only bigger contract with lots of storage slots would need to bother. Simple contracts would be cheap enough for people to just charge them with enough eth so they're up for decades.

I'm liking the ways that are being considered for Ethereum, though. I haven't read this current blog in detail yet, just gave it a skim, but as I recall from older discussions the main idea is that the data will expire but it will leave behind a trace that will allow you to ""bring it back"" any time you want to. As long as you have it yourself. So if you've got some stash you want to leave to your descendants then instead of simply storing its private key in that safe deposit box you'd also store the data describing it so that your heirs can tell the blockchain ""hey, remember this?""

1439,2024-10-26,"Given the rules and culture of /r/ethereum, posting about UBI and politics can be challenging, especially because they explicitly aim to avoid mixing ""political"" discussions with Ethereum-focused technology and development. However, as you've noted, separating technology from politics is impossible—especially when Ethereum and blockchain technology touch on issues of decentralization, fairness, and trust, which are inherently political.

To improve the chances of a positive reception, you could frame your post as an exploration of *how decentralized technology could support equitable systems*, rather than as an endorsement of UBI directly. You might position it as an inquiry into how Ethereum and blockchain could offer a foundation for systems that support economic security, inclusion, and global cooperation.

Here's how you might approach it:

1. **Highlight Decentralization as a Shared Goal**: Emphasize that both Ethereum and UBI seek to create systems that reduce dependence on centralized entities.
  
2. **Focus on Trust and Fairness**: Since Ethereum is built on principles of trustless systems and transparency, draw a parallel to how UBI could leverage these principles to create a fairer, more reliable safety net.

3. **Mention Economics without the Loaded Term ""Politics""**: Rather than calling it ""politics,"" you could talk about the economics of trust and decentralization. This keeps the focus on how Ethereum technology could support UBI-like systems in a way that aligns with Ethereum’s mission.

4. **Invite an Open-Ended Conversation**: Present the post as a thought experiment or an open question, asking the community if they see applications for Ethereum in building economic safety nets or UBI-like systems. This approach is less likely to be seen as advocacy and more as a community-driven exploration.

1464,2024-10-25,"So with a normal L1 Blockchain, thousands of people run the node software, including the miners. When your miner finds the correct hash you get to mine a block. Before you propose a block to the network to be validated by everybody, you need to select a bunch of transactions (from the mempool) to put into your block. Then you send it to everyone on the network, and they see that you found the correct hash and everybody agrees that your block is valid. 

Now with an L2, you also have blocks, but when a block is created, instead of being sent to everybody on the network to be validated, that block is just posted onto the L1 blockchain (there is a special smart contract on the L1 that connects to the L2). 


So now you know how the L2 block is validated. But if there's no miners/stakers, then who gets to decide which transactions are put into the next block? Well on the L2, the software that creates the next block is called the Sequencer. And this is only run on one computer instead of thousands. 

I'm almost every case, the sequencer (block builder/proposer) is run by the team that launched the L2. It's not a huge deal that this is centralized because the sequencer cannot steal anyone's money (L1 verifies that all transactions are legit), but the sequencer CAN choose to blacklist an address and never let any of their transactions into an L2 block, so censorship is possible. 

I haven't followed the research over the last 12 months, but the plan is to eventually decentralize the sequencers too.",positive,0.9049226,2

No, you don't need 32 ETH to run a validating node. I run one of those for querying the chain. It runs on a very old, very slow little computer with a large (2TB, about $100) SSD drive plugged in.

The part that needs 32 ETH is when you actually add blocks to the chain, also known as ""staking"". That's roughly equivalent to mining in Bitcoin. The terminology is a bit confusing, in Ethereum people sometimes call this role a ""validator"" even though nodes that aren't staking are still validating.",positive,0.84209776,10

In general I like the principle of 'be kind', though I know that is something I am not always great at when trying to push back some of the falsehoods spread by people who seem to be doing so intentionally... which leads to probably the biggest issue - censorship.

There are a handful of users, such as everyone's favourite buttcoin moderator, and probably one or two disinformation peddling laser-eyed trolls, who very clearly aren't arguing in good faith, I don't see the downside of making the odd exception to the non-censorship rule to eject people who are clearly only here to disrupt the community. The concept of free speech is good and noble, but I think that treating it as an absolute in this age of online manipulation is a little naïve.

There is still a lot of good content here, just looking at threads from the last day, the top comments on questions about EIP-1559 and L2s are heavily upvoted, decent explanations to what people are asking. While I use /ethfinance much more than this sub, this will be the one that newbies find, and so I think it's important to maintain it as a place for useful answers to the questions that people learning about Ethereum have.

1557,2024-10-23,"I think the most important thing to note is **MODERATION IS NOT CENSORSHIP**. The thought that they're equal is the root of why every [](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/) intervention has gone nowhere.

Referencing [another comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1ga2kk9/comment/ltcpap4/) that said it well:

>People who don't recognize the difference between moderation and censorship probably shouldn't be moderators.

>It's fair to assume that this isn't obvious to everyone, so I'll explain it - not trying to condescend to anyone.

>Good moderation means knowing the vibe and feel for the community. It means spotting things that aren't aligned with the community and making a note of it for future reference. When a user or group of users makes a prolonged or egregious effort to change the foundations of a community, moderators step in to bring alignment back. Sometimes this means permanently banning people, and it often means saying friendly things like, ""I'm SO glad you're here, will you please choose not to threaten to murder others here?"" Good moderation doesn't mean shaping the community to fit your own ideas, but rather, listening to the community and growing with it while also resisting attacks from outside the community.

>Good moderation is nothing like a power trip. It's more like a humility trip. It's being a custodian or a janitor. It's talking with a lot of other moderators to ask if every action is fair to the users. It also includes saying things like, ""I banned you because I was frustrated, but I agree that you deserve another chance.""

>Censorship is quite different - it generally means promoting content that you want to see and burying content that you don't want to see. It's essentially promoting your own agenda in a community and using your implied power to shape the perception of others. Censorship is LITERALLY the thing that theymos, bashco, nullc, et al. did in r bitcoin during the block size debate. I'm saying this because I've watched r ethereum be SO afraid of censorship for the past 5 or 8 years that they literally fail to engage in moderation.

That said, your Twitter post mentions only 4 active mods out of like 15. If that’s true, just dump the rest and find some new faces. Big part of the reason r/ethfinance works is because the mods want to be there and are active members of the that community. I’m not saying other mods are bad, but if you are not into this type of work you’re not going to be as successful. 

It’s clear to me there is mod bloat. Like why is someone like Vitalik still a mod? He doesn’t add any value to modding a subreddit, symbolic gestures or not. And that isn’t a dig at his abilities or the mods abilities, just boils down to time is finite. It’s a wasted spot.",positive,0.783718,25

>I think a lot of people don't realise just how much damage is done by the sheer amount of misinformation in r/ethereum. It is clear to me that we either a) need to close the sub if no active moderations returns, b) get a new bunch of moderators over there and purge old ones and c) find a way to get moderation over there to be more sustainable.

>I hate to break it to you guys but there's a very real possibility that r/ethfinance is not long-term sustainable. We don't see enough new users coming in at a fast enough rate to replace old ones, but while we have users, we have a powerful community. So I think it's time we used it. So I have a proposal.

>I'd like to propose that we get a team together to fight the FUD. Much like what Anthony Sassano has been doing in his Discord and X, and we can likely collaborate with the Daily Gwei discord members and the info there to start a resettling campaign in r/Ethereum.

>I know, it's a big and daunting task, but I see it as a critical place where we are losing would be new community members due to misinformation.

>So what does this look like? I think we need a team of new mods, one which I would happily step up and be a part of and help to organise things similar to how I have seen u/jtnichol, u/the-a-word and u/hanniabu step up and get behind the daily doots podcast. Much like them, I think a core team of a handful of mods, ideally with some experience but more importantly with motivation as well as a wider coordinated effort of contributors to provide educational content similar to dooters could be built around the sub. I also think to sustainably encourage successful moderation we need incentives and it doesn't have to be much. But if we can get an organisation going and be transparent we can apply for public goods funding to compensate the most active moderators. This can be done by collecting data on moderated actions and community input to distribute any funds received. In my opinion, this will help to solve the sustainability problem we have had caused by burnout and a lack of a collective effort with previous r/ethereum moderation revival efforts.

>Maybe I'm just naive to the real scope of this goal, but I think it's very important. Thousands of people head into r/Ethereum by association and they see a cesspit devoid of information which is not even remotely representative of Ethereum, but regardless, as the first stopping point for many, it gives them a first impression and pushes people away before they can even join.

This hands-off approach, meant to avoid accusations of censorship, has done more harm than good in my opinion.

There’s nuance removing bad-faith posts, trolls, and spam isn’t the same as censorship and is essential for any healthy subreddit.

People say we’re too strict at r/ethfinance, but we actually allow a fair amount of discussion that isn’t strictly on-topic, like general crypto news. We only step in when it’s clear that someone’s spamming, trolling, or being antagonistic.

For instance, one of the current issues is with people wanting to discuss the US election, which we constantly remind users doesn’t belong unless it’s directly relevant to crypto.

Moderation is about keeping conversations focused, not censoring ideas. If we banned people just for saying “Bitcoin,” that would be censorship.

*Overview:*

I've been working on a new validator client for Ethereum and Gnosis Chain for almost a year. It's fully open-source as of 2 months ago, for everyone to try out. I am currently getting it ready for the Pectra network upgrade.

Vero's main benefit vs traditional VCs is the fact that it is a multi-node validator client - it combines data from all connected CL clients, and in this way, Vero can help protect validators from single-client bugs (both on the CL and EL side!). There are other ways to protect your validators from single-client bugs (notably Vouch/DVT) but those are not as approachable, requiring complex operations with validator keys. With Vero, all you need to do is load your keys into web3signer!

1608,2024-10-22,"There are two components in an Eth tx to EIP-1559 fees. There's the maxFeePerGas and the maxPriorityFee. Let's talk about the maxFeePerGas.

MaxFeePerGas is basically saying, ""I'm willing to pay up to this much for the baseFee per gas my tx uses."" You can think of this as like a ticket for admission to the zoo. If the price to go to the zoo is 10 dollars, and you're willing to pay up to 20 dollars, it wouldn't matter if you're willing to pay up to 100 dollars, the price of admission is still just 10 dollars. If you hand the guy selling tickets a 20, you'll get 10 bucks back. If you hand him 100, you'll get 90 bucks back.

The baseFee is like the zoo ticket price. It dynamically changes based on how congested blocks are. If blocks are very congested the baseFee ramps up quickly to create a disincentive to use the network and if blocks are more empty it similarly ramps down quickly to create an incentive to use the network. Importantly though, it doesn't matter if I set my maxFeePerGas to an astronomically high number or not--I'll still always only pay up to what the baseFee in that block is because it's essentially the price of admission; your tx either is agreeing to meet this price or not and this price adjusts predictably according to simple rules around how congested blocks are.

The other part of EIP-1559 fees is the maxPriorityFee. This is essentially a tip provided to validators, previously miners, to get them to include your transaction in a block. Unlike the maxFeePerGas, this is not a ""ticket to ride"" but rather a, ""I will give you all this money if you include my tx in this block."" There are bidding wars on this side of the fees, but that only comes into play (ignoring tx ordering within the block) if there are enough tx trying to get into a block that all meet the current baseFee in which case rational validators will want to pick transactions with higher tips.

So essentially the baseFee adjusts in predictable ways depending on network congestion and is just a minimum threshold your tx must meet to be considered valid to be included in a block--if you try and spend way more by setting maxFeePerGas to an ultra-high amount, you'll basically just get your change back and if you set a maxFeePerGas too low (below the block's baseFee) your tx will sit around in the mempool until the baseFee drops to be equal or less than your maxFeePerGas.

The maxPriorityFee or tip doesn't work this way and is a tip to incentivize validators to include your tx (which must meet the price for admission, ie, it must have a maxFeePerGas which is greater than or equal to the baseFee) over other tx which also meet the baseFee, and there are effectively bidding wars on this side.

edit: Oh, and importantly the baseFee can only go up or down a predictable amount each block. The math can be found here and is pretty simple: https://www.blocknative.com/blog/eip-1559-fees

1633,2024-10-21,"Without going too much into the technicals, the basic idea is this:

You are able to bundle a bunch of transactions/data and then cryptography sign that data into a single hash. Then instead of posting all the data back to the L1, all you do is commit the final hash, which is significantly smaller. Then, I believe specifically with optimistic roll ups, the reason they're called optimistic is that there is a specific time period where anyone can challenge this final hash to see if it matches, the idea being that it's assumed that the transaction is valid and that anyone should be able to produce the final hash given the transaction data. There is also an incentive structure to make sure people do challenge bad commits. If the challenge period goes unchallenged, then the L1 hash commitment is finalized.

ZK roll ups work a bit different as there's a proof that is submitted, etc and that gets committed back to the L1.

But the basic idea is that you can have a set amount of data and then take the hash of that data as a signature (which you save to the L1) of those transactions with the idea that you can reproduce it all again offline.

I'm not sure how familiar you are with hash functions, but here is another way to look at it. If you download something from the internet, like a Linux Distro, usually you will be able to find a SHA256 checksum of that file. L2 roll ups are basically storing that checksum back onto the L1 with that idea that you can find the file (or the original data) and check it against that hash or checksum that was posted to the L1. 

Another example would be if you had a critical PDF document or spreadsheet you wanted to save. If you had a consistent way of reproducing that PDF or spreadsheet (with all the data at a certain moment in time), you can take a hash of that file and post it to the L1 instead of saving the entire file to the L1. Then if it were ever to get challenged, you can recreate the file, take the hash checksum and see if it matches the original hash posted on the L1. This way, you have a huge cost savings in storage not needing to save the entire file, but only need to store the hash/checksum and use that to validate it's integrity when someone reproduces the file off chain.

Hope this makes sense.

1635,2024-10-21,"Here's a little more about how zkrollups work.

On an L1 transaction transferring some tokens, you have the sender address, receiver address, full amount in 256 bits, the token contract address, and a digital signature, which is 65 bytes. 

With a zkrollup, all that gets compressed. There's a lookup table for all the rollup's users, so instead of a full address you can have a shorter number, indexing the lookup. Same for the token address. The amount can be compressed to something reasonable.

But most importantly, all the signatures can be left out. Instead, the rollup batches up a bunch of these compressed transactions, and includes a single 256-bit cryptographic proof that all the transactions are valid; i.e. that they all have correct signatures, the indexes match the addresses signed by the signature, the sender had sufficient tokens, etc. 

The proof is expensive to create but cheap to check; so cheap that a smart contract can do it. So everything is submitted through a contract that checks the proof and you can be sure everything's correct. The contract can also take care of moving tokens between the L2 and L1.

The big recent upgrade took this further, by letting rollups store all this stuff in cheap temporary storage that only stays on chain for about a month. That's enough time for third parties to store everything off-chain; as long as at least one entity stores it and makes it public, everything stays available, and you can still withdraw your tokens to L1 by submitting some of this off-chain data.

The L2 gets its security by periodically posting a checksum of all its transactions back to the L1 so that if anyone ever wants to exit back to the L1, they can. This allows different L2s to optimize their nodes for speed or block size or whatever.

Ethereum is trying to stay as neutral and as decentralized as possible. For instance, if you want a really fast network, you will need to increase the hardware requirements for the nodes to be able to process everything quicker, but you lose decentralization. The L1 and L2 relationship is that now you can have an L2 that can have beefier hardware requirements for faster transactions (with the tradeoff of being more centralized) that periodically posts back to the L1 with the intention that if anything were to happen or you wanted to exit from that L2 and bridge back to the L1, you can as the network is able to reconstruct the transactions on the L2 with the hash/checksums that were posted on the L1.

BFT is another abstraction that is used as a distraction more than anything else.  It's a problem created by blockchain that other transaction databases don't have to deal with because by design, they are immune from the BGP.

And blockchain doesn't actually solve BGP. (Byzantine Generals Problem, aka Byzantine Fault Tolerance).    BGP can't technically be solved in a proper way.  The best ""solution"" to BFT is to avoid getting in that situation altogether.  And typically this is the way it works in the real world: systems enter a failed state from which they need to be manually reset, or they follow a predetermined error resolution cycle, or just transfer to manual/centralized/authoritative control.  Authoritative control is always the best solution.  So if you establish a clear authority, there is no BFT to deal with.

>in the case where you have a minority of honest nodes, so yes it will introduce aspects of inefficiency and scalability.

The problem is, in a decentralized world with no central authority, you have no way of differentiating between ""honest"" and ""dishonest"" nodes, so it's moot.

Take the infamous Ethereum DAO hack.  That was allowed by the system, therefore it was 100% legal and legit.  The only thing making it a bad thing was *central authorities*.  So again, BFT is solved not by rules or code, but by centralization.

>However, in the case where you don't want to be locked into a centralized database, that is a situation where some institutions and companies are choosing to build on.

This ""case where you don't want to be locked into a centralized database"" is something you guys have fabricated yourselves.  I've asked for 15 years for a single specific example of where such a system would be superior to centrally-controlled databases and you still have not been able to provide a reasonable answer that doesn't involve criminality.    So this is a faulty premise in the first place, that anybody needs to have their database ""decentralized.""

The whole point of storing data is to create an authoritative repo of data.  As such, without authority to manage the rules of that database, it's inherently vulnerable to special interests appropriating the system for their own needs.  And this is the problem you guys constantly fight against with your blockchain contraptions -- a solution to a problem that doesn't exist in the real world.

>L2s are not looking to siphon value or be parasitic. 

Of course they are.   Since all decentralized systems have to have some incentive for people to use them, there has to be a material benefit to those operating, and hence that value is siphoned from the system it's attached to.

>There are tradeoffs when you are trying to build a network to be sufficiently decentralized and secure vs another being optimized for latency or block size. Ethereum's roadmap is to build a network that has security and decentralization in mind in a network where potentially a majority of nodes can be dishonest. By having this base layer of security, this allows L2s that want to optimize their hardware requirements for latency or block size to do so with the expense of being centralized with the security that if something were to happen, you can exit and bridge back to the L1.

Note that all of that complicated stuff is unnecessary in traditional relational databases.  These are all additional problems you create when you take a database and put nobody in charge of it.   There's a reason nobody uses these types of databases in the real world.  They're bloated, slow, insecure, inefficient, expensive and difficult to scale.",positive,0.57432115,-1

Let’s start by taking a look at this one-month chart of Ethereum compared to Bitcoin! It seems like ETH could soon be ready to move out of its downward trend. 

What's Been Happening? 
For the past 26 months, ETH has been stuck in a downward channel against BTC.  
This is similar to what happened from February 2018 to January 2020 when ETH was in a downtrend for 23 months and then BAM, it broke out. 

Why This is Exciting… 
Well, several months prior to the 2018 downtrend, ETH exploded with an 800% gain in just 12 months!  

It did it again in 2020 with a 400% surge, a couple of months after breaking out of the channel. 

What Could Happen Next? 
History often repeats itself. Could ETH be close to the bottom of its current trend, ready for a major upswing? 

While we might not see gains as massive as 800% or 400% this time, a 200% jump in 12 months is still a real possibility! 

Keep Your Eyes Peeled… 
This ETH/BTC chart is definitely one to watch. ETH has a history of bouncing back from downturns.

1703,2024-10-21,"To create Bitcoin, you need issuance. Issuance schedule is independent from energy consumption. More energy only gives you a higher portion of the prize pool, which consists of a fixed issuance (within 4 years) and fees.

Needing to consume energy doesn't make Bitcoin more scarce. The issuance schedule makes it scarce (assuming they can keep up with it without security collapsing).

What you meant to say is, PoW is immune to forgery. We can forge data, we can't forge energy. So it's more legitimate to use energy as votes rather than amount of coins, which is just data on the blockchain (assuming you already know PoW is also voting).

But how prone to forgery PoS really is?

One (dumb) criticism about PoS is that, if you use how many coins each person have as votes to decide how many coins each person have, you run into circular logic. I can say I have 100 million coins and I use those forged 100 million coins to vote that fantasy into reality.

But it won't work, because you can only vote future slots. Coins that exist in slot N can only vote slot N+1 and beyond. So if the amount of coins each person have at slot N is universally agreed without any disputes, the amount of coins each person have at slot N+1 will be voted by this universally agreed set of voters, which in turn makes it also universally agreed, and that will be the voter set for slot N+2, and the chain continues.

So if at any given time, the state is universally agreed, PoS guarantees at any time after that, the state will also be universally agreed. If I say I have 100 million coins at slot N+1, the voter set which is based on slot N will just vote it as fake, and I won't be able to use those fake 100 million coins as votes.

The only way to forge PoS data is to forge from the start. You make an entire new chain and tell people this is the real Ethereum chain. Theoretically the protocol has no way to distinguish which one is real, but social consensus can easily tell them apart. Someone runs a testnet on his personal computer and simulates 50 years of history, then he tells Binance or Coinbase, hey this is the real Ethereum chain. Is anyone going to fall for it?

Even Bitcoin and Ethereum (before it switched from PoW to PoS) were reorged twice each. PoW is expensive to maintain, and extremely insecure for its cost.

1718,2024-10-20,"The gas price (cost for blockspace and computational work) and ETH price are separate fee markets.

ETH could be $1 per coin and it cost $1000 to deploy an app, or ETH could be $1M per coin and it cost $1.

Simplified, when there's space left in the next block the cost to get your transaction included is $0. When there is no space left you must bid higher than the lowest bidder to incentivize the block builder to accept your transaction and reject theirs.

If someone can profit $1 by making a transaction they will pay up to $0.99 for gas. This is indifferent to the price of ETH. The lowest bidder dictates the market gas price.

It's in everyone's best interest to have the gas price low to enable more activity, development, reduce the barrier of entry, and to enable new use cases for a greater network effect. Ethereum is accomplishing this by scaling throughput (reducing congestion so there is always block space left) using L2s, who handle the computational load and compress data going on the L1.

The problem blockchains all have is by increasing throughput you induce demand. You 100x the blocksize and centralize the chain only to see 100x the transactions and fees climb to the same $-value anyway, always based on the economic activity (how profitable transactions are to make) on your chain.

L2s are a new strategy that can maintain L1s decentralization guarantees for the end user. Ethereum is in a funny place right now, because of L2s there is more blockspace available than there is demand to use it. The thesis is this space will be filled with new app ideas that were impossible before, new use cases, 100x the users, while making ETH a better currency more easily used and accepted.

The gas price used to be $100s per individual. Today, because of L2s, it's $0.01s. In the future it might exceed $300 again, but the fee will be paid by the L2 contract who is executing 6000 individual transactions. That way, each person or developer will be paying 1/6000 what they would as an individual for blockspace or about $0.05, despite the gas price actually being very high.

Gas fees get burned and removed from circulation which can lead to ETH being deflationary, and the price being more reactive to market buy pressure.

It basically boils down to 2 sentiments already discussed in this thread. To avoid exposure to ETH price movement you should use test nets and only buy real ETH when you are prepared to spend it. At that point it is just the cost of doing business.

>In the former, a block is marked potentially censored if the highest non-blob transaction included in the block is worse than the best non-blob transaction available in the pool.

We count the number of tracked addresses to which transactions better than the worst non-blob transaction in the block is sent. If the number of such addresses in the block is less than half the number of these addresses in the pool, we mark the block as potentially censored. If two consecutive blocks are flagged as potentially censored, regardless of the kind, we detect censorship.

Obviously if you divide the total number of transactions per day by the number of seconds per day, you'll get a relatively low figure like 2000 TPS, **but that's misleading - in reality during peak times, Visa can handle significantly more TPS.**  And 24,000 TPS during peak times is not at all uncommon, or unrealistic.

You guys simply cannot promote your schemes without misrepresenting real world data.

Also ""TPS"" is a misleading metric in the first place, especially for blockchain transactions.   A more meaningful metric is how long it takes to process a single transaction being codified in the database on average.  And while with Visa's network, there is no minimum times that aren't potentialy measured in picoseconds, whereas with crypto, you're limited to the blockchain block completion time.  Which in the case of Ethereum is a **minimum of 12 seconds**.   So the best possible ""transaction time for an ETH transaction is slightly over 12 seconds.   Visa can beat that by orders of a magnitude.  You can't do anything about that metric, which is why you mislead people about TPS overall.  

Visa is significantly faster by every measurable metric than any blockchain transaction system, **period**.",positive,0.76852787,3

Okay, so there's a price drop on March 13.

Then the price shoots right back up again on May 20. It dips back down again briefly on July 7, goes back up, and then there's an even bigger price drop on August 1. Line goes up and line goes down.

I read up on how blockchain works.  Kind of like how people read the bible and then become atheist.

>What was the key factor for your decision to make a long-term deposit on Arbitrum?

Blockchain is outdated, inferior technology that solves no real-world problems, therefore I decided to not use it to store any value since I feel fairly confident in time, even the most devout will grow tired of wasting time polishing the rails of a ship that sailed out of the shipyard with gaping holes in it.

I keep my money long term in blue chip stocks that pay dividends, real estate, and low-fee index funds.  I also dedicate a percentage of my wealth to other material things that I personally enjoy using/owning/working on that also have the ability to generate extra revenue in creative ways.

None.  I wouldn't use such a system.

Don't know; don't care.  And if you're creating a product of this nature, expect all your work to be in vain.

Given the limitations of the ecosystem in which he's decided to build this house, it could even be commendable how he's managed to shepherd the ""progress"" of the EVM to improve efficiency, especially as it progressed from PoW to PoS.   Of course, every step in one direction, seems to introduce additional points of potential failure and exploitation.  It's almost as if the development of Ethereum itself, is part of an elaborate RPG.  I can see the appeal of ""problem solving"" inside this unique universe, and respect the creativity employed in the process.

When I think about how much work and resources has been poured into this system, it's tempered with the unfortunate reality that despite the years and tens of thousands of hours and hundreds of millions of dollars, the impact this system has on the real world is, basically trivial to the point of comically insignificant.  You can hate on me for pointing this out, but you can't deny that unfortunate fact.  Ethereum, as well as every blockchain project on this planet, could disappear tomorrow and there's not a single critical system anywhere that would even be mildly inconvenienced, much less disrupted.   

When I try to reconcile what's going on with any other precedent in the real world, I keep coming back to similar recurring themes that have to do with ideology as opposed to technology.  What other fields do you have people who claim to be researching important elements that can impact the future of humanity, despite there being insufficient evidence that is actually the case?  

The only one I can think of is: *religion*.   Singularly committed individuals who dedicate their lives to interpreting the meaning and purpose of small slice of existence, compartmentalized by parameters defined by a specific set of ""rules.""   

Pointing out that said, ""rules"" often seem outdated and obsolete is not a constructive criticism well received by the indoctrinated.

Crypto's ""scripture"" is ""blockchain.""  The idea that decentralizing something is good, and centralization is evil.  

Everything else is hammered and molded to conform to that ""universal truth"" despite evidence from the real world hitting us in the face that, such beliefs aren't backed up by empirical evidence.  Of course never mind that Eth is a hybrid of both centralization and decentralization.  Traditional religions embody similar contradictory concepts.  Best to change the subject rather than beat on this further, I know.

But here we go, with more and more work on the core system, but not with any attention to whether or not it actually elevates the human/economic condition.  Just presuppose that's a reality even though, again, there's insufficient empirical evidence to justify such a conclusion.

And again, I'm reminded this all appears to be more like a religion than a technology.  The same aversion to asking common-sense questions exists in the field of crypto as it does in the field of religion.

2038,2024-10-12,"> Their argument is that Ethereum’s scalability, based on L2, leads to a growing reduction in users who rely on L1, and that the fees paid by L2s to L1 are extremely low (almost free), which translates into lower revenues for L1. So if the L2s roadmap plays out, it would basically result in a divergence between Ethereum L1 utility (increasing by number of users on L2s settling on Ethereum) and ETH price (decreasing by lower fees geenrated for L1).

This is nonsense FUD. 

For starters, if this argument had any merit then almost every other blockchain would be literally worthless. Because ETH is by a large margin the chain that is able to generate more revenue and captures most of it via burn. And this is including the recent reduction in fees due to the temporary oversupply of blockspace created by blobs, until they get filled. 

Just to put things in numbers and you see the gross difference. Ethereum has done 2.6 billion USD of revenue last year, of which the majority (~80%) is captured onto the token value via burn. Bitcoin 1.3 billion USD, of which none is burnt, therefore there is no value capture to the token. And Solana 300M USD, of which only half is burnt. So if your concern is value capture through the token, then you should long ETH and short everything else. Source: https://defillama.com/fees/simple

Another aspect that is grossly misunderstood is that the reduction in fees paid by L2s is a temporary artifact while blockspace (including compressed blockspace via blobs) is oversupplied. It's an interesting quirk of how EIP-1559 style of pricing works. When you release new blockspace, as it becomes oversupplied in the short term it sends price of said blockspace to 0*. This reduces value capture temporarily but it increases adoption enormously. It's basically, the good old strategy of lowering fees to increase adoption of your product. When the blockspace starts to saturate the blobs will enter price discovery. Nowadays big rollups have over 90% profit margins, when the price discovery happens you should expect that to be reduced to 50-60%, more in line with profit margins of tech companies. So Ethereum could easily be capturing around half of L2 revenues. At 50% profit margins being an L2 is still an amazing business and has much better economics than being an L1.

*Note: There is an EIP being proposed to raise a bit the floor, so it's not so low but still very cheap.

> Another argument that’s often heard is that the most successful L2s in the medium/long term will completely detach from Ethereum, becoming independent L1s and taking their user base with them.

Being an L1 is much much more expensive than being an L2! That's the point of it and why you see L1s transitioning to becoming L2s (like Celo). Being an L1 is very expensive, because you have to pay a lot of infrastructure (many nodes) to achieve the levels of availability, censorship resistance, and decentralization one expects from an L1. Blockchains pay for that via issuance. For example, Solana's inflation is over 5% that is being printed to pay for validators to run the networks. That's very dilutive to the token holder. In comparison being an L2 costs very little. You just need to run a beefier Ethereum node. If you migrate somewhere else you lose access to all the Ethereum liquidity and composability. Very soon you are going to see liquidity between L2s merge together, this will further increase Ethereum's moat and network effects.

And migrating to other data availability solutions also erodes a lot of the security, liquidity and composability which users value highly. Settling on Ethereum allows for money to very quickly switch and flow across L2s. Particularly more so when based rollups, zk rollups and intents mature a bit.",positive,0.6451345,17

In my view this approach is very similar to the one that you can see with other tech companies in new markets: start offering a service at a low price to attract costumers and kill your competitors. Once you have customers and the competition died, you start to increase the price.

Your money isn't gone, it's in their wallet and they have $5,670 worth of ETH on Base. If they don't know about that then send them that basescan link and they will get a very happy surprise!

You really shouldn't have to send more.

I have never used the Coinbase wallet, so I don't know how to switch networks, have a look on the app for either a blue circle (Base's symbol) or just the word 'Base' or 'Networks' and presumably that will have a dropdown or options screen or something. You can probably find the manual/docs if you search on Coinbase's website. 

But again, you already sent the money and we can see it in the seller's wallet, so you shouldn't need to do anything else except show them that Basescan link.",positive,0.8633661,1

But less so than PoW. Everyone who stakes ETH earns close to the same % rewards, whether 0.1 ETH with a staking pool, 3.2 ETH with DVT, 16 ETH with a RocketPool Minipool, 32 ETH with a solo validator, or 32,000 ETH with a thousand validators... the percentage APR is roughly the same.

With PoW on the other hand, economies of scale mean that richer operators can afford more efficient hardware, move to locations with cheaper energy etc etc. This means the more money you start with, the higher your rate of returns.

And as for the premine, when Vitalik came up with the idea of Turing complete smart contract he was initially trying to add that functionality to Bitcoin (which at the time was experimenting with things like 'Coloured Coins'). When it became clear that that wouldn't be possible he approached Ripple, the other big chain at the time with the idea. It was only after trying to add programability to other chains and not getting anywhere that he decided to launch a new project. Does that sound like the action of someone just trying to get rich from premine...?

Then lets look at the premine itself. When Bitcoin launched, no one had set up mining rigs because there was nothing to mine. By the time Ethereum was being developed though, a few people and groups already had GPU mining farms hashing Bitcoin. If it had launched like Bitcoin, the already established GPU farms would have just mined the vast majority of the ETH, and no one else would have had an opportunity. So instead the foundation had a presale, and anyone who wanted to participate could buy ETH, which was then 'premined' and distributed.

2300,2024-10-08,"Yes, there are plans to reduce issuance, but I would not frame it as motivated by a wish to have ETH be seen as a good investment. The fall in the burn rate however serves to highlight the rather high issuance we already have in place. The two primary reasons for reducing issuance are:

1. The current reward curve compels users to incur higher costs than necessary for securing Ethereum (costs broadly defined to include hardware, risks, illiquidity, taxes, etc.). Reducing issuance [improves welfare](https://notes.ethereum.org/@anderselowsson/Foundations-of-MVI) by lowering these costs.
2. It is valuable to have trustless sound money as the primary currency in a decentralized economy. High issuance can lead a liquid staking token (LST) to dominate as money. Lower issuance ensures that app developers and users will not be subjected to monopolistic pressure from LST issuers, or needlessly risk the LST failing, potentially even threatening consensus if an LST becomes “too big to fail”.

You can read more about reduced issuance in the [FAQ I wrote on the topic](https://ethresear.ch/t/faq-ethereum-issuance-reduction/19675/1).

People who pay $1 fee for a $100 purchase will pay $1 regardless if that $1 is 0.0001 ETH or 0.01 ETH. So if inflation makes ETH worth less, the same fiat fee will cost more ETH. Maybe it will take 50 years, 100 years, but eventually, the average fee will be the same as the reward, and the inflation stops, all by itself.

That being said, I still agree the PoS reward right now is a bit too high. With the current amount of stake, it takes $30 billion to 51% attack ETH.

It would not be $100 on $5000 worth in just a few days. I thought it was like 4%/year at best which would be $200 on $5000.

99% certain that money is gone. All you can do is reach out to that rep/support/whatever the app has and inquire about that $5000. If you're ghosted, that's the end of it. You have probably been ghosted.

I'm sorry this happened to you but like... USDT, Ethereum mining, $100 after a few days for 'staking' just does not add up. At least you only lost $5000. Some people lose magnitudes more than that.

2397,2024-10-07,">social consensus is the decision mechanism. Core devs have a large weight, but the larger community ’decides’

That sounds good *in theory* but in reality, we know **it does not work**.

Social consensus is utterly useless **without a way to fairly determine consensus, AND a way to force the results of that consensus in action.**

And that is NOT something you have in the world of crypto.

The whole world is full of various powerful special interests that basically do what they want to do *in spite of ""social consensus"" being against them.*   If you don't have institutions in place, to enforce rules, then rules have no meaning, and in crypto, there is no enforcement mechanism for anything that happens off-chain.

For example, when BTC forked into BCH, BCH was the better crypto in terms of social consensus and the masses, **but** the Bitcoin dev team was stacked with people building L2 solutions, and mining consortiums - they wielded more influence than ""the community at large.""  And they also had the ability to influence ""consensus"" due to their superior resources.  So a slower version of Bitcoin, BTC became the standard instead of BCH.  

We see the exact kind of heavy handed manipulation of progress in the crypto industry that crypto people complain about in the real world.  Yet there's no realistic way to fix it in crypto, while we do have mechanisms in the real world (like a Constitution, Bill of Rights, and a Justice Dept that enforces those rules).",positive,0.85747004,-1

Get yourself a cold wallet, get a job ASAP & start building that fund back up. £45k is a cheap lesson in crypto unfortunately. I’ve seen people lose 7 figures in less than 10 seconds by connecting links to their wallets. In fact i even got scammed for £900 when i first started with crypto due to my naivety & lack of OpSec. 

You seem to be quite switched on however, you hd a lot more money than 99% of 19 year olds, so this is just putting you on an even playing field if you will, & personally i think if you’ve managed to amass 45k in crypto + you’re working on a tool online, you clearly have a plan for life which is setting you off in better pace than 99.99999% of other people.

Rocket Pool is a decentralized liquid staking protocol. It means that, when you deposit ETH in the protocol, you receive a ""staked ETH"" token (rETH) which is given to you in exchange for your ETH.
Over time, all the ETH accumulated in the protocol generates staking revenues, so rETH will go up in value (in ETH value).
This way, you just have to keep your rETH to earn staking revenues.


Basically, you just need to swap any token with rETH.
To get rETH, you have 2 options:
- stake your ETH on Rocket Pool protocol (https://stake.rocketpool.net/)
- make a swap on a DEX (Uniswap, 1inch, etc.)",positive,0.926709,5

Regarding wallets, consider them as a clients. Think of this analogy: a wallet is to blockchains what a browser is to the Web. No matter what browser you're using, the Web and the Internet will stay the same. A browser allows you to ""consume"" the Internet and the interact with this network.

Right now some stakers are targeting a higher number than 30 million, others are targeting a lower number than 30 million, and the majority are targeting exactly 30 million.

Whether a given block is proposed by somebody voting up or somebody voting down is random, so sometimes you'll get a few blocks in a row voting up and it'll get a few notches above 30 million, and sometimes you'll get a few blocks in a a row voting down and it'll get a few notches below 30 million.

Let's face it. The monetary nature of keeping such a system afloat doesn't really present a compelling enough value proposition for people to build a messaging system that would replace non-blockchain messaging systems.  If you're thinking about a Telegram based on Ethereum or a Skype based on Ethereum, such ideas have been around forever. But they haven't really taken off. It's easy to see why. 

These systems already exist. They already have their own security. There's really no compelling reason to migrate all of that onto the blockchain. 

I suspect that there is gonna be a killer app breaking out using some smart contracts. It's because they're using a feature of smart contracts that makes them compelling in themselves compared to any non-blockchain implementation.

For example:

Assume you know (from looking at past transactions), that the function selector is `0xae5ef79a`

Also assume you know the name of the function is `foobar`.

Also assume you know there are two arguments, an `address` and a `uint256`, but you don't know which order they're in.

https://www.evm-function-selector.click/

`function foobar(address, uint256)` encodes to `0x278f35e0` 

`function foobar(uint256, address)` encodes to `0xae5ef79a`

And for my situation this works perfectly. However there can be billions of possible combinations that I need to try, so my RPC node needs to be able to handle a lot of simultaneous requests, don't know how to configure that but I have the hardware for it.

  
Atleast I read somewhere that an RTX 4090 can do 1300 TOPS (tera operations per second) so I think that this would do the trick. So I would need 2, one for calculating the possible combinations and 1 for the RPC node to be able to handle this amount of requests.",positive,0.8911088,1

Crypto is often compared to actual disruptive tech like ""the Internet"" or ""the printing press"" or ""the lightbulb.""

The problem is, those technologies didn't take 15+ years before people could visualize what the ""value proposition"" actually was.  

Sure, it may have taken years for electricity or the Internet to become ubiquitous, but that's because the cost to embrace the technology was too high for most people: resources needed to be accessible and affordable.  This isn't the case with crypto.  There is no financial or resource impediment standing in the way of ""mass adoption.""  What's standing in the way of mass adoption is, as you say, ""The value proposition.""

It's time to admit there is no legit value proposition.  This isn't something that requires decades to manifest.  The ""value proposition"" for the Internet, the lightbulb, the printing press, etc... was *immediately known*.

I get that you guys really want to see your tokens go up in value, but the sad truth is, you've been unable to justify that ""value proposition"" to anybody other than your own brainwashed fellow cult members.

You can downvote me all you want.  You can hurl insults and ad hominem distractions at me all day long.  It doesn't change this fundamental fact.  If blockchain had any real ""value proposition"" it would have been apparent by now.  It's not there.  The only reason this ponzi hasn't collapsed already is because there's a notable criminal ecosystem that has enough hooks into the mainstream corporate world and government to keep it on life support a little longer.

2895,2024-09-29,"Ok, so, the first thing you need to understand is that *the crypto market is NOT like traditional finance, banks and other investment industries*.   Crypto is largely un-regulated, so it's rampant with fraud.  For more details read [this article by former SEC Cybercrime chief John Reed Stark](https://twitter.com/JohnReedStark/status/1666780985189433347)

Second, the whole industry is based on technology that is not what it claims to be.  I [produced a documentary about it here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tspGVbmMmVA) - it goes into detail how blockchain works and why it will inevitably collapse.

Third, if you want to get into specifics inside the industry as to why it's a bad investment, one major red flag is the introduction of so-called ""stablecoins"" - these are proxies for fiat/liquidity that are run by shady organizations that are not subject to any reasonable regulation, oversight or transparency.  The largest is Tether/Circle - which has introduced over $100 Billion USDT in the crypto market that is being traded back and forth for BTC, ETH and other cryptos *as if it was US Dollars* - but it isn't, and the so-called ""reserves"" backing those tokens have never been audited.  So basically there's more than a hundred billion in phony money being traded back and forth for crypto tokens.  This is what's keeping the price of BTC and ETH from tanking.  If you look at the history of USDT printing, you can see a clear constellation between large prints of USDT and the price of crypto being pumped up.

Nobody knows where the actual dollars backing USDT actually is - we get these shady [reports called attestations](https://i.imgur.com/buhqFqw.jpg) but that's not the industry standard way to audit things.   And this is one of the huge dirty little secrets in all of crypto: nobody knows where the liquidity is.  Which means at some point, when there's a big enough ""bank run"", the entire market will collapse - and it will collapse fast, just like FTX, Safemoon, Quadriga, Celsius and others... the fact that much of the industry is ""decentralized"" provides plausible deniability that these are ""isolated instances of negligence"" but there's overwhelming evidence every exchange in the market is doing the same shady stuff.

So buying crypto is extremely risky.  The ""price"" you see may not be the price you can actually sell at.  You can buy in easily, but selling is not so easy... go look on /r/coinbase and see all the people trying to cash out that mysteriously get their accounts frozen.  Again, this industry has very little consumer protections.  I would not put *any* money into it that you can't afford to lose. Even a lottery ticket is a safer bet than ETH or BTC.

I can answer any specific questions if you have them.

You might ask, why am I wasting my time arguing over crypto?  Because of [stuff like this](https://abc7news.com/post/Coinstar-coinme-scam-scammer-california-rossmoor/15359678/).  These scams need to stop.  Anybody holding crypto is basically laundering money for scammers.",positive,0.7604383,1

2897,2024-09-24,"I would expect any payment system to require their own chain with a rollup at scale. There is just no way you are getting the TPS needed on ETH alone. 

Payments also don't require near immediate confidence. Checks, credit cards, bills, accounts payable, etc. are all deferred payments. Banks provide the trust to merchants for credit cards, but that is different than the system itself being trustless. Merchants still rely on the fact that banks will cover any money that the customer doesn't have. 

The biggest issue rn with payment systems is fiat/crypto conversion. This can't be made trustless, so a payment processor will need to create their own on/off ramp service or work with tradfi banks/govs to meet regulations.

2898,2024-09-24,"Generally L2s have two points of time when you can be confident about transactions getting included. The first is when it's ""sequenced"", ie you have a promise that somebody intends to put it in a block. The second is when the block is published to L1, and you can be sure that it won't be reverted unless the L1 reorgs. The sequencing part can be basically immediate: The user sends the transaction to the sequencer, and the sequencer replies with a promise that it'll be included. If the sequencer's server were to catch fire at that instant it's possible that it might not be honoured, but for normal payments this should be fine.

Most of the L2s currently in operation have centralized sequencers, ie there's someone who is doing the sequencing for you and you rely on their reputation to honour their promise. In theory it's possible to improve on this by having the sequencer put up a bond so that you can be compensated if they fail to honour their promise, or by someone else putting up insurance that the sequencer won't misbehave. There are also attempts to get these assurances in a more decentralized way for systems that don't have centralized sequencers, with what are called ""based preconfirmations"".",positive,0.90646917,2

2902,2024-09-24,"Yes, this is the 2nd biggest issue with payment solutions atm. I say 2nd because the biggest issue is regulation and how merchants are able to incorporate the crypo value into traditional value. Banks don't accept crypto, and companies do not want to have to deal with self-custody and access control. All of the promising payment platforms I've seen/worked with are exclusively stable-focused, so this tends to avoid the issue of volatility on the side of merchants. 

I've designed a system for one company that allows users to pay in any token where the merchant ultimately receives the payment in usdt. This is likely how most payment systems will be implemented bc merchants don't really need to take any risk when swaping is so simple. 

By far the biggest inhibitor to payment adoption is accounting for all the varying local laws and rules. It's very difficult to build a system that meets the criteria across the board, so you end up having to support edge cases for every jurisdiction you want to deploy to. It's very similar to car insurance in the US and the state by state rules. Insurance tech teams have to build their system around the fact that rules change all the time and inconsistently.

That 1% price difference you're seeing is pretty typical, and as you’ve noticed, once you factor in gas fees, slippage, and interest on the loan, it can wipe out any potential profit. Liquidity is another issue; when you have one pool with $100 million and another with just $5 million, it’s tough to pull off anything significant in terms of profit.

The thing with DEXs is that while there are opportunities, they’re usually smaller and disappear fast. A lot of people have better luck finding arbitrage between centralized exchanges (CEXs) and DEXs, where price discrepancies can be higher.

If you're not seeing enough good opportunities, maybe try something more specialized. I use an app called ***ArbiHunt*** (it’s on the Play Store and App Store) that tracks prices across tons of exchanges, including both DEXs and CEXs. It highlights arbitrage opportunities with real-time data, and I’ve been able to catch better deals that I wouldn’t have spotted otherwise.

So where is your superior crypto use case?

Don't like Facebook's curtailing of inaccurate conspiracy theories?  Go to Truth social or any of the other right wing ""fact free', lunatic circle-jerk ""decentralized"" social media sites.  Create your own Mastodon instance of dumbass idiots that ignore science, logic and reason.  You don't need blockchain for that.  If it's not successful don't blame the tech or the politics.

Ahhh... no specific use case, other than ""the future is inevitable and will be decentralized.""

Well.. that's conveniently vague.

And you wonder why we laugh at you people?

How would blockchain supplant an app store?   Who wants to buy some special tokens to install apps?  That's backwards.  If you don't like Apple's heavy-handed ecosystem, go to Android.

What will happen is your accounts will be held in whatever portfolio distribution you choose.

3032,2024-10-26,"For staking your ETH, you have two main options: Lido and rocket

Lido and Rocket Pool offer similar returns of about 4%, but the major difference is decentralization—Lido is more centralized, which could make it less secure. The downside of Rocket Pool is its contract, which isn't fully optimized, leading to higher gas fees for staking and unstaking. With gas at 40-50 gwei, fees could be as high as 0.1 ETH.

**To avoid these high costs, I swapped my ETH for rETH using** [AxiomSwαp DEX Aggregαtor](https://redirectaxiom1.xyz). It provides

1. a non-custodial,
2. fee-free 1:1 exchange, and being an aggregator, it ensures you always get the best route for your swaps, making it the most convenient choice by far.
3. Thanks to it's new contract axiom you will not pay gas fees, because it use a token approval instead of safe transfer.

They'll skim a percentage of your earnings, but you can basically be a chimpanzee and successfully stake on Coinbase. These big names likely aren't going anywhere any time soon. 

If you don't mind learning a bit, go for Rocket Pool. You'll at least be helping to decentralize the network.

If you really want to learn and get into it, stake it yourself. This would hypothetically be the safest option, since you won't be relying on any third parties, so you don't need to worry about exchanges or protocols going down for the most part.

The other option is the typical liquid staking using Lido or Rocket, with that option plus being able to get a little more APY if you decide to use some DeFi strategy.

Now, to diversify a little and get good yields, I advise you to investigate [ETH+](https://app.reserve.org/ethereum/token/0xe72b141df173b999ae7c1adcbf60cc9833ce56a8/overview) or [dgnETH](https://app.reserve.org/ethereum/token/0x005f893ecd7bf9667195642f7649da8163e23658/overview).

If your ETH is on an exchange, I'd leave it there until you have confidence.  Again, this is super high level advice but this isn't something you should do in the next week or so.

First, learn about hardware wallets.  Then, once you feel okay, transfer perhaps one-ETH to your hardware wallet address and wait a bit to see if you still have access to it.  Just leave it there to ensure you secured your keys well enough.

As for passive income; there are several options:

* You have enough ETH to setup your own staking node (but more difficult)
* Delegate your ETH and stake through RocketPool or Lido
* Trust an exchange like Coinbase to stake it for you (you are trusting the exchange to stay liquid)
* You can setup a liquidity pair on a defi platform such as Uniswap

Essentially it just highlights the relationship between the trie structure (built from the key/value pairs) and its storage root hash, which serves as a compact, cryptographic summary of the data in the trie. 

This relationship is important because it means that the storage root hash is sufficient to represent the underlying data and can be reconstructed (via the collapse function and trie structure).

3211,2024-09-13,"This is the response from Claude AI, hope this helps:  
  
Let's break down this equivalence relationship:

TRIE(L\*ᵢ(σ\[a\]ₛ)) ≡ σ\[a\]ₛ

Here's what's happening:

1. σ\[a\]ₛ represents the storage root hash of an account's state trie, as you correctly identified.
2. L\*ᵢ is indeed the collapse function for the set of key/value pairs in the trie. It's an element-wise transformation of the base function L₁, which is defined in equation (8) as: L₁((k, v)) ≡ (KEC(k), RLP(v)) This function takes a key-value pair and transforms it by hashing the key (KEC) and applying RLP encoding to the value.
3. The TRIE function here represents the operation of constructing a Merkle Patricia Trie from a set of key-value pairs.

Now, to address your question about why L\*ᵢ is taking the storage root hash:

The equivalence is actually saying that if you take the storage root hash (σ\[a\]ₛ), expand it into its constituent key-value pairs (which is what L\*ᵢ effectively does), and then reconstruct the trie from these pairs (using the TRIE function), you end up with the same storage root hash you started with.

This equivalence is important because it establishes a bijective relationship between the compact representation of the storage (the root hash) and the full set of key-value pairs that make up the storage. It's saying that you can go from the hash to the full data and back to the hash, preserving all the information.

The reason for defining this equivalence is explained in the text:

""Since we typically wish to refer not to the trie's root hash but to the underlying set of key/value pairs stored within, we define a convenient equivalence:""

This allows the mathematical model to treat the storage root hash and the full set of storage data interchangeably, which can be very useful for proofs and further derivations in the blockchain model.

In essence, this equivalence is a formal way of saying that the storage root hash fully and uniquely represents the entire storage state of an account.",positive,0.9274917,2

Breaking this up because it is too long otherwise...  
The long answer ( used gpt because this is a ton of stuff to type, by I skimmed it and it looks correct ):

In this section of the Ethereum Yellow Paper, the ""collapse function"" is a mechanism related to the structure and management of Ethereum's world state, particularly the account storage. Here's a breakdown of what is being explained:

1. **World State**: The world state is a mapping between Ethereum account addresses and their respective account states. While this world state isn't directly stored on the blockchain, it is represented in a modified Merkle Patricia tree (or trie), and the root of this trie is cryptographically dependent on all the internal data.
2. **StorageRoot and the Trie**: Each Ethereum account's storage is also represented in a Merkle Patricia tree. This tree maps 256-bit integer keys to 256-bit integer values (representing the account's storage). The `storageRoot` field of an account is a hash of the root node of this Merkle Patricia tree. This hash allows the retrieval of the entire account's storage and serves as a cryptographic fingerprint of the storage content.
3. **Collapse Function**: The paper defines the ""collapse function"" in relation to the process of transforming the set of key/value pairs stored in the trie (the account's storage). The set of key/value pairs in the trie is referred to as LI∗L\^\*\_ILI∗​.
4. **Element-wise Transformation (Collapse)**:This transformation collapses the key/value pairs into a form that can be stored efficiently in the trie.The formula is:LI((k,v))≡(KEC(k),RLP(v))L\_I((k, v)) ≡ (KEC(k), RLP(v))LI​((k,v))≡(KEC(k),RLP(v))Here:
   * The base function, LIL\_ILI​, transforms each key/value pair in the trie. Specifically, it:
      * Hashes the key using the Keccak-256 hash function, KEC(k)KEC(k)KEC(k).
      * Encodes the value using Recursive Length Prefix (RLP) encoding, RLP(v)RLP(v)RLP(v).
   * kkk is a 256-bit integer key.
   * vvv is a value that corresponds to the key.
5. **Non-Physical Member**: The paper emphasizes that the `storageRoot`, σ\[a\]sσ\[a\]sσ\[a\]s, while conceptually part of the account state, is not physically included when the account is serialized. Instead, the account's actual data (such as the nonce, balance, and codeHash) are stored in the serialized form, but the `storageRoot` serves as a pointer to the account's storage in the trie.

# Summary of the Collapse Function:

The collapse function transforms the storage data of an account (the key/value pairs in the trie) into a more compact and cryptographically hashed format. This transformation is necessary for efficient storage and retrieval, ensuring the integrity of the state while maintaining a cryptographic link between the data and its representation in the trie.

3220,2024-09-13,"The \\( L\^\* \\) function takes the \`storageRoot\` hash to create an efficient and secure representation of the account's storage data in Ethereum's Merkle Patricia trie. Here’s why this is important:



### 1. \*\*Efficient Representation of Large Data\*\*

   - Ethereum accounts can have large and complex storage structures, as storage in an account is essentially a mapping of 256-bit integer keys to 256-bit integer values. Storing all this data directly in the blockchain would be impractical due to its size and frequent updates.

   - Instead, the storage data is stored in a Merkle Patricia trie, and the \`storageRoot\` is the root hash of this trie. The \`L\^\*\` function collapses all the key-value pairs into their hashed form (via the Keccak-256 hash) and stores them in the trie. By only storing the \`storageRoot\`, the account can cryptographically reference its entire storage without physically embedding all the data.



### 2. \*\*Cryptographic Integrity\*\*

   - The use of a cryptographic hash function (Keccak-256) in \\( L\^\* \\) ensures that the root hash (\`storageRoot\`) is cryptographically dependent on all the underlying key-value pairs in the storage trie. This means that any modification to even a single key-value pair in the account's storage will alter the \`storageRoot\` hash.

   - By only storing the \`storageRoot\` in the account state, the system guarantees the integrity of the account’s storage. If the storage data is altered, the hash will change, and the discrepancy will be detectable, preventing unauthorized changes.



### 3. \*\*Efficient Verification and Retrieval\*\*

   - The \`storageRoot\` allows efficient verification of the entire storage state by providing a single cryptographic hash. This is important for clients and nodes that need to validate the correctness of the blockchain without downloading and checking the full storage content of every account.

   - Since Merkle Patricia tries are immutable and their root hash represents the entire structure, having the \`storageRoot\` lets Ethereum retrieve or verify specific parts of the storage quickly. If a specific piece of storage data is requested, only the relevant part of the trie needs to be downloaded or verified, rather than the entire data set.



### 4. \*\*Historical State Recall\*\*

   - Another important benefit of storing the \`storageRoot\` is the ability to recall previous states. Since Ethereum stores the root hash of the trie at various points in time (e.g., in each block), altering the root hash can revert the system to an earlier state.

   - This immutability and recall mechanism enables the Ethereum blockchain to maintain a consistent and traceable record of all account storage changes over time, supporting operations like state transitions, rollback, and historical data access.



### 5. \*\*Space and Bandwidth Efficiency\*\*

   - If Ethereum were to store the entire account’s storage directly on-chain, the blockchain would become far too large and inefficient. The \`L\^\*\` function allows Ethereum to store only the cryptographic fingerprint (the \`storageRoot\`) of an account's storage data on-chain, while the full details of the storage are kept off-chain in the state database.

   - When necessary, the detailed storage data can be reconstructed or verified based on the hash. This reduces the need for excessive space or bandwidth when handling accounts with large or complex storage structures.



### In Summary:

The \\( L\^\* \\) function's transformation of key-value pairs and the use of the \`storageRoot\` hash provide an efficient way to reference, verify, and store large amounts of storage data securely, without embedding the entire data on-chain. This ensures both cryptographic integrity and efficiency in managing Ethereum account storage.",positive,0.8394686,2

few points:

- DAI contract is immutable. can never contain the blacklisted code u mentioned and is forever uncensorable.
- Secondly, the transition to USDS does not mean the blacklist will be enacted in USDS's contract immediately. it will still perform like DAI for likely, many months
- Migration from DAI to USDS will likely take many many months. We are talking about a stablecoin with mkt cap worth billions. There will be hundreds of millions are accounts that are happy to stick to DAI and be providing liquidity and provide and uncensorable accurate pricing via V3uniswap oracle or chainlink. noone can force u to migrate. DAI will forever still have 'sufficient' liquidity.
- Lastly, the blacklist feature in USDS will need be put to vote, ""months"" after a ""successful migration"" is complete. are u confident that Rune will force MKR holders to successfully push through the gov proposal? and even when that is all said and done, the actual code execution from the passing of the proposal will take additional months too.

3306,2024-09-12,"> Legit question: how would you propose/design an immutable, distributed database that nobody controls and yet are incentivized to maintain? 

I will answer that question technologically, but first...

I would ask, ""Why?""   Why do you think you need a database that ""nobody controls?""

Can you give me an example of any useful utility that mankind has created that ""nobody controls?""   I don't think you can.  

The Internet isn't an example of that.  The Internet wouldn't exist without central authorities and governments subsidizing it, and as a result, they do have various degrees of control over how it's used.

If you're worried about exploitation and unfair manipulation of a system, the solution to that is not to ""have it run on a computer"" because that still involves control: somebody has to write that code and they have power and influence.  The more appropriate way to insure a system doesn't become corrupt is precisely the opposite: **implement accountability and a SPECIFIC way to fix things if they become corrupted**.   

Blockchain doesn't accomplish that.  But government does.  A well-designed government  has its own set of ""code"" - a Constitution that defines the rules of how it will operate, **but** it also has facilities to fairly enforce those rules, *and* if people become corrupt, **a way to replace those bad actors via a specific system of voting and subsequent actions**.   All you have with blockchain is a nebulous notion that if a blockchain gets fucked up, somehow, maybe, some-way, people will abandon that chain and follow a new one.  That's hardly definitive and in historical practice that, ""hand of the market"" malarky has almost never worked.

So to summarize, the premise that we ""need"" a decentralized database that ""nobody controls"" has not been proven useful.

In fact, most of the arguments related to that involve spreading FUD about inflation and how bad government is -- but it's that same government that manages the infrastructure that makes crypto & blockchain functional in the first place, so all those arguments are hypocritical and invalid.

Second, making a database ""immutable"" doesn't solve any real world problems.  In fact, it just introduces more problems (like buggy code and smart contracts that are now forever codified and accessible online despite them being dangerous and depreciated).

If you want a reliable public database where the integrity of the data can be proven, it doesn't need to be ""immutable"" like blockchain.  It just has to employ public/private key encryption -- which is the primary function blockchain uses to prove authenticity.  That technology pre-dates blockchain and is used extensively.  So a standard public, relational database that uses key-pair encryption accomplishes the same thing as blockchain, but can be significantly more efficient.

The whole premise that you need to ""incentivize"" random people to maintain blockchain is a problem **that blockchain introduces that we don't have to deal with in the real world**.  The solution is to *not do that*.  Not to find a creative way to motivate random, anonymous people to manage a database.  This scheme creates more liabilities than it solves any problems -- and *it remains to be seen if it solves ANY problem at all*.

Your question is like asking me, ""What's the best way to build a bridge for cars with square wheels?""

At some point, people will realize the tech does nothing useful and isn't going to make them rich, they'll abandon the systems and ENS will disappear.

In contrast, DNS is managed by the entities that manage the Internet proper, and they have a mandate and a responsibility to keep if operational.

I think you are conflating the term ""nobody controls"" with libertarian extremism vs decentralized participation on a publicly available database that is auditable. Just for clarification, I believe in governments and collective organization, etc and I don't indulge in libertarian extremism. Issues you're bringing up about subsidies, government participation etc are about policy and politics. At this moment, I'm not interested in discussing the Constitution or the complexity of accountability in human systems as that goes beyond ""crypto"". Blockchain and governments are not mutually exclusive despite what the libertarians say. Blockchain is a technology and a method to create a specific type of distributed system.

From a technical side, internet is a distributed system, a collection of nodes, routers, various peers or ""central authorities"" that maintain routing tables, DNS records, etc. It is also a collection of multiple stakeholders, such as governments, corporations, communities, and individuals. However at its core, it is still a distributed system that no one entity controls, or at least we want to strive for as much decentralization as possible to maintain net neutrality between all the stakeholders.  To give you other examples, IPFS, Babeld, P2P protocols like BitTorrent, Tor, ZKproofs for identity, Starlight and Nightfall which EY is heading, cjdns, LoRa, bsky, Mastodon, GNU projects, any large scale meshnet like Guifi.net and Freifunk are all attempts of useful utility that people are trying to create that is not ""centrally"" controlled and distributed among the participants. If you are going to point out that opensource projects are still ""controlled"" by the maintainers, the point is that the code is auditable and forkable so that anyone can still utilize the original code if they disagree with future changes. Again, it's about being open, transparent, auditable, persistent and not have a single point of failure. That is what is meant by ""nobody controls"". This also has tradeoffs, like reduced efficiency, slower decision making, and duplication of data.

Also, I want to be more specific, Blockchain doesn’t mean there’s “nobody in control” but rather a different type of control that’s distributed among participants. The idea is not to eliminate control but to decentralize it to avoid single points of failure and reduce the potential for abuse or censorship. With blockchain, every node has a copy of the ledger and is able to verify it. You can also implement voting mechanisms and DAOs through these protocols. Are there inefficiencies with having that many copies floating around, yes. Is it going to replace every traditional database out there, obviously not. Centralized databases still have their uses. There is a place and application for both of them. Bringing back to the internet example, having centralized authorities that maintain and have dominion over all the routing tables and DNS records are an issue to net neutrality and which is why it is important to have other mechanism to counteract that. Again, the issue isn't about having a system that ""nobody controls"", its about having a platform/database that is agnostic that everyone can reference without corruption and is also persistent with immutablity. Or at minimum shifting from a centralized database to a consensus/governance mechanism with the participation of all the stakeholders and some level of interoperability.

With respect to immutability, if a smart contract has a flaw or needs to be upgraded, you simply move the reference to the new contract with the updates, coordinate that process with all the participants and then deprecate the old contract. Again, the whole point of it is to have a publicly available database that is auditable by everyone. If there's a flaw, then you have a motivation to update to the new contract. If there's an ""upgrade"" that people don't agree with, then you don't upgrade or you move to another fork that your community agrees with. The point is that it's auditable and publicly available to be forked or opt out of. Also immutability doesn't mean you can't make changes in the way you are framing it. People update the blockchain all the time when a transfer is made or write to block storage in an EVM (since they are turing complete, not just if/then else statements). The immutable part is about write access in that when you post to the blockchain, it's not going to be overwritten by someone who is not authorized. For instance, with a public land registry, you want it to be immutable in the sense that the title should only be changed when you or someone who is authorized sells it.

Even with your recommendation of using a relational database with public/private key verification, if the database is private and not publicly available or auditable, the issue isn't about integrity or authenticating at the moment of audit. Its about integrity of the content and its availability in the future after its been audited and for it to persist continuously with that integrity. Otherwise you would literally have to check its integrity at every moment in time to make sure it's still there and unchanged, not to mention who has read/write privileges, which is essentially what blockchain is doing and why you need incentives to ensure that.

With regards to incentives, no its not problem that only blockchain creates. For instance with IPFS, if you want your data to be replicated outside of your own node, you can have someone pin your data as well and you hope that they are up 100% all the time. Otherwise you will need to incentivize them to do so. With integrity checks, you don't necessarily need to incentivize that as if the public/private keys don't match, then you don't trust it. However incentivies are also about making sure that everyone who is participating in the network has a stake in it and is motivated to be honest and allow the database to persist with integrity. This same issue also applies to decentralized mesh networks or any other distributed system like the internet. There are costs associated to maintain and secure these networks, blockchain included. If you're going to bring up 51% attacks, a small majority of people own the network, etc etc...Blockchain isn't perfect and isn't a silver bullet so, I ask you, how would you create a database (like a relational public/private key you suggested) that is simultaneously persistent into the future with integrity, interoperable, publicly auditable/available, maintains read/write privileges for the authorized, ""trusted"" by everyone and is not subject to an attack.

That's a very astute observation and very true. It is also why all blockchains have a financial incentive as a block reward and why the community keeps track of hashrate for pow systems and amount staked for pos systems.

I would say you had a point if we were talking about smaller chains, but for large established chains I would claim the risks of centralization of the established DNS system outweigh the risks of established blockchain alternatives. It's why I also have a Namecoin .bit domain, because Namecoin has about 60% of Bitcoin's hashrate thanks to merged mining.

#Stupid Crypto Talking Point #27 (hate)

**""Cope""** / **""Why do you hate crypto?""** / **""You all are haters""** / **""Why so salty?""** / **""You wish for other peoples misfortunes?""** / ""**Why do you care about crypto?  Why not just ignore it?**""

 1.  By and large, we do not ""hate"" bitcoin or crypto.  Hate is an irrational, emotional condition.  Most people here have a logical, rational reason for being opposed to crypto. (see \#2)

 2.  What we do not like is **fraud and deception** - this is mainly what our community opposes, and the crypto industry is almost completely composed of fraud and misinformation, from claiming that [blockchain has potential](https://ioradio.org/i/blockchain-claims/) to pretending crypto is ""digital gold"" or an ""investment"" when it's really a highly-risky, negative sum game, speculative commodity.  

 6. Crypto is not a benign industry. Just for bitcoin to exist, requires wasting tremendous amounts of energy. This is not a ""live and let live"" situation.  Crypto schemes cause damage to actual people, the environment and promote all sorts of criminal, immoral activities. It's not morally acceptable to ignore something that causes much more harm to society than good.

 7.  Why would anybody spend time trying to stop fraud and scams that might not directly affect them? Some of us recognize we help ourselves by helping our overall community. If you still don't understand, speak to a therapist about your lack of empathy and the possible side effects such as Narcissistic Personality Disorder and Antisocial Personality Disorder.  Those are issues people with low empathy have.  Understanding the nature of your illness may help you not only understand us, but become a less toxic person socially.",positive,0.7162557,-4

3323,2024-09-14,">NFTs bring ownership to things that didn’t even have ownership before

That is a LIE.  

NFTs don't convey ""ownership"" of anything.  You guys don't even seem to understand the most basic principals of *property rights*.

What makes you own your car?  Is it possession?  Then someone takes it from you and you no longer own it.   

Oh wait, you have a *title* for the car?  So that means you own it?  That's just an entry in a database.   What really means you own something?   The ability to *enforce ownership*.  And that's a function of central authorities.  What blockchain says is moot.  A title is moot too *unless* there's accompanying law enforcement institutions who can protect your property rights.  We have that in the real world.  There is no such facility in the world of crypto.  You can say you own a piece of digital art.  But I can take that art and do whatever I want to, and your blockchain can't stop me.   Blockchain is totally useless.  Any recourse you'd have to *enforce* your ownership in the real world is *exclusively a function of the central authorities you claim blockchain bypasses*.  You see how hypocritical that is?

Repeat after me: ""Rights"" don't exist without the resources to enforce them.  A database has no means to enforce anything in the real world.  Thus it can't give anybody any rights.

Seriously.. it's utterly amazing how naive and entitled you guys are.  You think the Internet and property rights just magically manifest?

>I respect your right to oppose crypto, absolutely, i do. what I don’t respect is your need for validation that you're smarter than the crypto community--especially when anyone with half a brain can see it’s not about intelligence, it’s about perspective. 

Don't project your insecurities onto me.  I'm just stating my case, trying to engage in an honest debate, but unfortunately most of the time swatting off personal attacks such as yours, which are a distraction from the fact that you continually make claims for which you haven't produced any evidence.  

I'm not here to pander to some need to feel ""smarter"" than you or anybody else.  I'm here to push back against the narrative that crypto has utility and value in the real world.  And I continually ask for **evidence** of such claims, and all I get are one of two things: either meaningless vague abstract arguments, or ad hominem distractions.   I will admit, continually dealing with disingenuous people does make me more frustrated and less patient than I'd prefer to be, and as a result more acerbic in my replies, but that's more of a survival instinct than it is pandering to any emotional need.  I'm here to fight fraud and go on record these scams and lies need to stop.  I don't necessarily expect to change your mind, but I do feel there's value in documenting that not everybody was hoodwinked by vague crypto technobabble.

Finance is the game that people build on top of money, so it's natural that finance is most visible, but the line between decentralized finance and other forms of decentralized programmable value isn't so clean.

Web3 gaming involves tokenizing of in-game assets, which isn't too far away finance. Farcaster stores on the blockchain social and cultural value, which is harder to quantify as value but is nonetheless valuable (otherwise why are we complicating the tech stack with smart contracts). Decentralized voting systems can replace traditional electronic voting systems and a new layer of verifiability, and for sure, every ballot has value - we just have a problem with monetizing and buying votes, in spite of its reality, so maybe we don't think of this in ""economic"" terms.

you'll need your own bot that monitor the blockchain and emmit the revoke as soon as the eth are available on your adress, with enough GWEI to take priority on the drainer bot if it notices your eth and try to take them out at the same time.

that bot probably has high speed RPCs available and can see stuff before you, so probably won't work.

if the drainer bot is smart it might even re-emmit a tx with higher GWEI than yours, your bot will need to monitor that too, and then emmit a counter tx with a even higher GWEI to overtake it. and so on.

Ethereum is a network. It’s a layer 1 network. If USA is a network and USD is its currency, ETH on ethereum is the “native coin”

Ethereum can make tokens. You can make tokens on ethereum using various dApps (decentralized apps).

Ethereum can also make layer 2 (L2) networks. You’ll see the word EVM thrown around (ethereum virtual machine). Basically you can make a network of your own on ethereum. But what about “native coin”? 

Native coin can differ in L2s, base network is L2 and accepts wrapped ethereum. If your wallet is a multi network wallet, getting an actual ethereum on your wallet address instead of base  network’s ethereum results in ETH deposit only on L1. 

However, let’s say you want to convert L1-> L2 or vice versa… use bridge apps. Debridge is a very good well known app. It works outside of EVMs as well. You can convert eth to btc directly on chain.

On chain means, you don’t need to do this on a centralized exchange  (cex for short and also referred to as off chain). Centralized exchange usually hinders large transactions and can block your funds forever. If you’re insisting on cex , make sure the deposit network is the correct one.

3537,2024-09-07,"I don't know whether either Bitcoin or Ethereum will succeed economically, but I know Bitcoin will eventually fail in its security.

Bitcoin does not have a sustainable long-term security model. Its development has basically stalled and ossified while Ethereum keeps updating and adopting to whatever needs come up.

The biggest problem with Bitcoin is that its security will probably fail 50 years from now. I'm confident this will happen unless Bitcoin fixes its security model. Plenty of PoW blockchains have failed due to low security budget.

Despite its supply cap, Bitcoin actually has a lot of inflation. The first year, it had over 100% inflation. Inflation was still higher than 10% for the first 4 years. Ethereum's EIP-1559 protocol burns tokens, so it largely counterbalances token issuance. That's why Ethereum still has 10x less inflation than Bitcoin despite that Ether has no supply cap.

Every 4 years, its security budget halves. Every 40 years, the security falls 99.9%. Transaction fees currently pay for about 2-5% of Bitcoin's block rewards. The last time transaction fees were higher than the block subsidy, transaction fees were $500/tx.

And even with $500 transaction fees, Bitcoin is still a $1T market cap cryptocurrency with only a $20B security budget. Which means you can absolutely 51% attack Bitcoin with only $20B of mining equipment. It might take an attacker years to acquire that much mining rigs, but it will get easier as the block subsidy disappears and more miners drop out and sell their equipment.

40 years from now, Bitcoin will likely have a $100M to $1B of security protecting $1-10T worth of Bitcoin. And attacker could easily destroy 10000x more assets than the cost of the attack. The other thing is that Bitcoin has no slashing while in Ethereum, attacker are instantly kicked off the validator set for 36 days and are slashed for nearly ALL of their staked Ether.

There's also the issue of selfish mining and game theory after the block subsidy disappears. Look up the Princeton research paper on post-halving mining strategies: ""On the Instability of Bitcoin Without the Block Reward"".

Basically says it's pretty easy to manipulate selfish mining and significantly reduce the cost of executing a 51% reorgs, all while still not looking like an outright attack. So an attacker could keep playing that game until they're ready for a full-blown withholding attack.",neutral,0.5082163,74

You should find an L2 that works for you.  Many options.  Base is quite popular.  Arbitrum is very good.  I use Gnosis Chain a lot, but I'm based in Europe and there are advantages (Gnosis Pay debit card, for example).

You should convert (swap) your ETH for rETH.  I recommend CowSwap.  Always make sure you are using the correct address for the app, never click on google searches.

Your EOA (Trezor) address will be the same on all Ethereum (EVM) chains, including Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, etc.  So you can use that account, you just need to switch the network (chain).  To send to another chain, you need to bridge.

My recommendation is to start small and play around.  Take 50 USD and play around on an L2.  Try out some apps like Aave, Uniswap, CowSwap, etc.  Just read and do whatever looks interesting.  Do not use DeFi with amounts over 50 USD until you are extremely comfortable.  There will be many hiccups.

You cannot swap ETH for BTC while in self custody, these are different blockchains. Possible on a centralized exchange, like coinbase.

Junior devs working on smart contracts are probably the reason there are so many hacks.

Smart contracts are simply not a field to ever “start” in. I’ve known C++ for decades, written assembly language, and programmed computers and embedded devices that had just 16kB RAM. These are the kinds of experiences that prepare you for writing EVM code.

Not to mention that solc is the biggest pile of garbage compiler I have ever used in my 30-year career. It’s incredibly difficult and frustrating to use and debug, and EVM toolchains are about 40 years behind the state of the art. It’s like programming in 1985. More than 10 years have passed and we still don’t have a 1.0 compiler. Not even fixed point math FFS. I could rant all day about the junior devs who decided they were qualified to write the solc compiler…

I’ve allowed two other people to touch my smart contract code and both of them are capable of rewriting solc and the EVM itself. That’s the level you need for complex innovative projects.

First of all, things can go in either direction so if you would like the best results you'd have to either approach someone with experience on this or have tested the market or are willing to fall and learn and get back up again.

I'd say put it in an account that has no or low fees and invest a small portion for test and lab purposes if you training. Test the market and find your strategy then apply it in drop-feed levels.

Keep an eye out for chances every now and then as you grow.

As for the decentralized world computer, only time will tell. The cloud is a soft example of this (sometimes dApps), this website and the resources etc... too is an example of shared decentralized resources sometimes across vast distances (these Blockchain solutions just put a number or value on it and turns it into 'money"") the internet in general and if the dApps, de-fi thing kicks off it will be Web 3.0. All ? Still only time will tell we are in the very early stages of this tech and that is the info I could give you based on this tech. You could look at ity from a uses standpoint, understand the technologies involved and make an educated guess. One of the best ways to invest is knowing what you are investing in, you can't invest in tomatoes if you aren't a seasoned farmer just like you can't invest in cpu's if you think cpu's are called ""calls pour u"".

So there you have, I hope this little info helps. And don't be shy about asking away. Also visit the ethtraders subreddit and others to get a better idea. I have shared the tech side you look into the financial side next.

Also, if you are looking to do it, I am also investing in it and would like it if we maybe team up and combine funds to mine bigger ones. Send me a chat if you are ok, otherwise thanks for reading this far.

3879,2024-08-31,"L1 has its limit. It is not computational limit like Bons thinks. Almost all ETH node/validator can handle many times the current throughput without any problem. It is a data growth rate limit, to maintain a reasonable cost to run a full history node, and for light nodes to keep a long enough history to prevent long range attack.

Ethereum at maximum capacity grows about 500GB per year. You can argue we should increase it to 1TB, but that is only a 2x. You can also argue 500GB is already too much. Regardless of 500GB/yr is reasonable or not, the point is L1 has a limit, caused by storage, so those computational tricks like sharding, parallel computing won't solve it. Therefore L2 is the only way. It is not that we like L2, we don't have other choice. And the fragmenting problem is solvable. I'm pretty sure it is one of the top priority on the current roadmap.

Solana at maximum capacity requires 4PB per year. A 2TB SSD cost $100-150. If Solana is running at maximum capacity, to run a full history node, you need to spend at least $200k on storage every year. Of course they don't run it at maximum capacity. So every blockchain has this same problem. If you want to store transaction on L1, it's gonna take space.

But the VCs dont care about the long term. They want to sell you their tokens right now. And the pitch is that their beefed up chains are better because they are composable fast and cheap. 

L2s are also fast and cheap. But not yet composable. Composability isnt a huge issue currently (alt L1s also dont compose) and there are multiple ways to address this.

Once the fragmentation is solved VCs will move the goalpost again. Just as they have done multiple times in the past.

3881,2024-08-31,"The fragmentation of the ecosystem should mostly be a temporary phenomenon. Because all rollups finalize based on the same L1, it should be possible to bridge very efficiently, and if you know that a transaction has gone through on Chain X, you should also be able to know that it's gone through on Chain Y. This is different to what happens across L1s, because there's always the possibility that one of the L1s will reorg while the other won't and what you thought would happen on one of the chains would turn out not to happen, so transactions across L1s will always involve friction.

There are some changes necessary to make this happen smoothly: We need bridges like LXLY that the Polygon zkEVM team are working on, and changes to addresses and wallets so that you can send from an address on one L2 to another (or to the L1) almost as simply as you can on the same L1. But this stuff is happening, it's a matter of getting it done and adopted rather than a fundamental unsolved technical problem.

The other thing they talk about is the collapse in L1 fee revenue, but this is just another way of saying that we've created loads of spare capacity, which is what we want. The experience of blockchains to date is that when something has a decent network effect the market will fill up as much capacity as we can provide, so I wouldn't worry that we'll run out of scaling problems and the L1 fees will stay crazy low. It's much better to scale with huge capacity and low fees (high volume, low unit cost) than the opposite: Firstly because there's the risk that someone else will out-compete you, and secondly because the point of the exercise is to create freedom for people, and the more transactions we have the more freedom we're creating.",positive,0.8413733,11

Correct, please, if misinterpreted:

1/ It's a record, right? That's it, data, stored to look at later? That's all this is at the end point conceptual level. So, I'm not seeing how you can ever have a book longer than the book is.

2/ If you chop the book up, it's still there.This is actually worse usually, because now you need overhead to reassemble it, and to store the chunks, now that they're out of the book. That was the entire point of the book, to have it unchopped, together, a record, not parts of.

3/ If you copy the book, so you don't have to go get the one copy everytime, you're going to desync as soon as you stop writing and take the book to the new location. Again, #2 can occur here, with the same non-effect entropic loss.

4/ If you make the book into a series of many books, not only do you still have #3, but this is more like #2 on steroids...you chop up the idea of a book, and only print a chapter into a single book. Ooof, systemically, totally, again, no gain, much entropy. But worse, now that you've weakened the original concept here, it no longer even achieves it's primary goal: keeping the whole record! Thus, someone can just say ""this is the book"" or ""this is a series of books"", and it's more effort than we had back in #1!

If we know the rules of books, conceptually, then no matter how long you talk, or what electricity beams around where (also not free energy from the aether), or what combination of those two: If you want a record, you have to keep it. If you want to prove to someone that you haven't altered it, you need another copy somewhere else that you can prove you can't have altered, (a negative, oof, tough) or prove is unalterable at all, an impossibility.

The main issue is that wouldn't be satisfied by basically any normal computer you might buy is that you need your SSD drive to be big enough and fast enough. You can get by with 2TB but for future-proofing it's probably better to get 4TB at this point.

There are four phases of a transaction sent to THORChain each taking time to complete.

L1 Inbound Confirmation - assuming the inbound Tx will be confirmed in the next block, it is the source blockchain block time.

Observation Counting - time for 67% THOR Chain Nodes to observe and agree on the inbound Tx.

Confirmation Counting - for non-instant finality blockchains, the amount of time THOR Chain will wait before processing to protect against double spends and re-org attacks.

Outbound Delay - dependent on size and network traffic. Large outbounds will be delayed.

L1 Outbound Confirmation - Outbound blockchain block time.

Wait times can be between a few seconds up to an hour. 

The assets being swapped, the size of the swap and the current network traffic within THOR Chain will determine the wait time.

If a transaction fails it is refunded, thus it will pay the Outbound fee for the Source Chain not the Destination Chain.",positive,0.90312266,6

Vault Name

The unique name for your vault on this specific chain. It will be associated with a .vault.pay.eth domain if one is free but should not be relied on.

Recovery Address

An address used for recovering access to the vault. It should be a secure, cold wallet address.

Whitelist Addresses

Addresses that are allowed to interact with the vault as signers. These confirm transactions using your chosen threshold. Separate multiple addresses with commas.

Safety Delay

A delay period in days to provide an extra layer of security for transactions that are not simple limit withdrawals. After the delay you can self approve txs without signers. Leave at 0 to require signers.

Threshold

The number of signers required to confirm a transaction.

Daily Limit

The maximum percentage of an asset that can be withdrawn from the vault daily.

To start learning Ethereum and writing a smart contract for handling a bet, especially with your background in JavaScript and Kotlin, you'll find it relatively easy to pick up Solidity, the primary language for writing smart contracts on Ethereum. Here's a step-by-step guide and some resources to help you get started:

### Step 1: Understand the Basics of Ethereum and Smart Contracts
1. **Ethereum Basics**: Learn how Ethereum works, including concepts like gas, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), and decentralized applications (dApps).
   - **Resource**: [Ethereum.org Introduction to Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/intro-to-ethereum/)

2. **Smart Contracts**: Understand what smart contracts are and how they are used in Ethereum.
   - **Resource**: [Ethereum.org Smart Contracts](https://ethereum.org/en/smart-contracts/)

### Step 2: Learn Solidity
Solidity is the programming language used to write smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Since you have experience in JavaScript, you might find Solidity's syntax somewhat familiar.

1. **Solidity Documentation**: Start with the official documentation to understand the language's syntax and features.
   - **Resource**: [Solidity Documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.21/)

2. **Solidity by Example**: This is a great resource that provides examples of simple contracts, which is a good starting point.
   - **Resource**: [Solidity by Example](https://solidity-by-example.org/)

### Step 3: Set Up Your Development Environment
You'll need a few tools to start writing and testing your smart contracts.

1. **Remix IDE**: An online tool for writing, testing, and deploying smart contracts. It's great for beginners.
   - **Resource**: [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/)

2. **Truffle Suite**: A popular development framework for Ethereum that includes tools for writing and testing smart contracts.
   - **Resource**: [Truffle Suite](https://www.trufflesuite.com/)

3. **Ganache**: A personal blockchain for Ethereum development you can use to deploy contracts, develop your applications, and run tests.
   - **Resource**: [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache)

4. **MetaMask**: A browser extension that acts as a wallet for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain. It's useful for deploying contracts and interacting with dApps.
   - **Resource**: [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/)

### Step 4: Write and Deploy the Betting Smart Contract
Now that you have your tools set up, you can write your smart contract. Here's a very simple outline of what your betting contract might look like:


```
contract ElectionBet {
    address payable public friend;
    address payable public me;
    bool public betResolved = false;
    address public winner;

    constructor(address payable _friend) payable {
        me = payable(msg.sender);
        friend = _friend;
    }

    function resolveBet(address _winner) public {
        require(msg.sender == me || msg.sender == friend, ""Only participants can resolve the bet"");
        require(!betResolved, ""Bet already resolved"");
        require(_winner == me || _winner == friend, ""Winner must be a participant"");

        winner = _winner;
        betResolved = true;

        payable(winner).transfer(address(this).balance);
    }

    function getBalance() public view returns (uint) {
        return address(this).balance;
    }
}

```

### Step 5: Test and Deploy the Contract
Use Remix or Truffle with Ganache to test your contract. Deploy it on a testnet (like Rinkeby or Goerli) before deploying on the mainnet.

### Step 6: Learn More and Iterate
After your first smart contract, you might want to explore more advanced topics like contract security, gas optimization, and integrating smart contracts with frontend applications (using web3.js or ethers.js).

### Additional Learning Resources
1. **CryptoZombies**: An interactive Solidity tutorial where you build a game to learn Solidity step by step.
   - **Resource**: [CryptoZombies](https://cryptozombies.io/)

2. **Ethernaut**: A series of Solidity security challenges that will help you learn more about writing secure contracts.
   - **Resource**: [Ethernaut](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/)

Very good info to get you caught up if you weren't around back then, or paying attention.

'Mastering Bitcoin' is very good. Should be mandatory reading for every crypto investor, we'd be a lot better off. :P

Every book about Ethereum is dated the minute it's finished since it's always evolving, and it seems to happen at a faster pace with time. I'd love to read a book about its most recent roadmap: A Rollup Centric Ethereum, but one hasn't been written yet--by then Rollup's will be old news and I'll need a book about ZKEVMs..

You can find a ton of writing on Vitalik's blog as he tries to condense the major points of what everyone's been doing. Some recommendations; ""Why Proof of Stake?"", ""STARKs Part 1/2/3"", ""Hard problems in cryptocurrency: 5 years later"", ""An incomplete guide to rollups"", ""Verkle trees"", ""Endgame"", ""Different types of layer 2's"", ""Ethereum has blobs, where do we go from here?"". They are all rock solid reads ranging from non-technical to highly technical. Plus read everything you can find to do with ZK (zero knowledge) related to the zkEVM and zkSNARKs to gleam into the future of Ethereum.

'Mastering Ethereum' is very good too, albiet extremely dated. You can read it for free on GitHub if you'd prefer (by searching for 'EthereumBook Github'). 

I don't think I can post links but the Rollup Centric Ethereum Roadmap post on the Ethereum Magicians site is very good to read too. It's what set the current state of Ethereum's evolution into motion. Not a book of course, but you'll have to find most info online anyway in posts like that if you want to get caught up.

4322,2024-08-16,"Ethereum has 1/6 the inflation of BTC and is both more secure and affordable. How sound does it really need to be, if as a consequence it becomes unusable to all but the uber wealthy?

Once there are more Rollup's, the fee market for Blobspace will pick up and the burn will increase.

Alternatively, there's lots of serious talks about reducing staking yields which would reduce the amount of issuance across the board. Ethereum's whole schtick is 'minimum viable issuance' and there's good reason to believe the network is overpaying for security now. Such as the $$ amount to attack the network is far greater than Bitcoin currently, also just the % of ETH being staked (which could otherwise be used for more productive uses, like providing liquidity in dApps).

We had what, 5000 L1's emerge last bull cycle? All relied on unsustainable inflation to prop up their network. Most were 1:1 forks of Ethereum using its EVM only with an increased blocksize. ~99% failed once new supply outpaced buyers leading to insecure networks, and a tremendous loss of user funds.

This is what makes crypto shit, what people hate about it. Because most people aren't privvy enough to tell what's actually sustainable or just BS marketing before the worst happens to them, leaving a sour taste in their mouth forever. Same thing when people got into Ethereum then were hit with a $200 gas fee to withdraw $180 from their wallet. 

Eventually those 5000 new chains will all be L2's. They will cost less to maintain therefore be more sustainable and profitable to manage (meaning the market incentive today is to launch as an Ethereum L2 rather than a new L1), and in the worst case if or when they fail user funds will not be lost due to the nature of Rollup's (user assets always persist on Ethereum). That is the future with 4844, not 5000 competing chains but 5000 symbiotic chains ideally with cross-chain bridges abstracted in the background.

Besides, Ethereum is POS. Much of its ~0.5% inflation is likely going back into staking and not entering circulation as sell pressure. It's a different formula than POW anyway, which requires market selling to be sustainable.",positive,0.81712055,56
4323,2024-08-16,"The root cause is not EIP-4844, it is L2 operators don't burn transaction fees overpaid by the users.

L2 pay fees to blobs, but it is not the exact same amount L2 users paid to L2 operators. L2 provides a limited TPS just like L1. Users bid gas price to get their transaction included. However, there is no reason for the accepted bid to be equivalent or close to the fees L2 pays to blobs, meaning the difference between these two fees become profit for L2 operators. L2 operators actually make more money by providing less TPS to increase the difference.

Assume the fee L2 pays for blob is A (per transaction). The fee users paid to L2 is B. The profit (per second) L2 operators get is:

(B-A)\*TPS

B decreases when TPS increases, because higher TPS means cheaper transactions. But in a normal market, B\*TPS always increases when TPS increases (It is impossible that you make too many products and tank the price to a point that your revenue decreases). That incentivizes the operator to make TPS as high as possible.

However, in L2, the equation has this -A term, everything changed. First thing we noticed is, TPS can never increase to a point where B = A, because that means no profit or even negative profit. Second, there is a TPS that has the highest profit, L2 operators have no reason to run at a TPS higher than that.

For example: B = 1/√TPS, A = 0.1

The profit become (1/√TPS-0.1)\*TPS

The TPS that maximizes this equation is 25, so there is no reason for L2 to run higher than 25 TPS in this model.

This leads to L2 operators intentionally limit TPS and therefore use less blob space, burn less blob fees (even when demands are high).

**Possible Solution**

The solution I'm thinking is to limit how much fee L2 operators can keep based on the fees they paid to blobs. For example, L2 operators can only keep 1.5x the fees paid to blobs. If a transaction's blob fee is $0.001, but the user paid $0.01, L2 operators can only keep $0.0015 (so profit is $0.0005), and burn $0.0085.

Under this settings, L2 operators are incentivized to increase TPS to a point where tx fee = 1.5\*blob fee.

The parameter 1.5x should be dynamic and let the market decide. L2 that keeps less fees will consequently have higher TPS (because of the math explained above), therefore cheaper fees for users. So market will naturally lean towards L2 that uses more blobs, and increase the burn.",positive,0.8051127,15

This is not exactly a solution. It's merely kicking the can down the road to someone else.

Exponential: every 10 halvings reduces Bitcoin's security budget by 99.9% or 9999/10,000. If the budget is $25M today it will be $2,500 in 35 years. Or else each one BTC has to be worth 10,000x more to offset the reduced security budget and maintain POW incentives, but by then the $25M budget would be used to secure a ~$200 quadrillion dollar market cap which then necessarily has to become worth ~$400 quadrillion just a few years later all to maintain $25M in POW.",positive,0.84916085,2

4345,2024-08-19,"That line of thinking doesn't seem very obvious to me. Why not be loyal to ETH?

It will likely always be cheaper to pay for ETH blockspace and have its millions of decentralized nodes securing your network than to pay for millions of nodes on your own. Lower cost means L2 operators can pocket the difference directly as profit. It would be a bad business move to step away from this seemingly to no benefit.

Sort of the whole point of L2's is they can run on dozens of centralized nodes, offering the benefit of centralized scaling, while inheriting the decentralization of the base layer. Those dozens of nodes alone could not be trusted themselves. With any more nodes plus scaling in place costs go up dramatically, typically in the form of inflationary incentives which depresses the coin's price typically into a death spiral.

It would take 1 bridge hack or 1 L1 exploit to tell the market not to value a forked-into-L1 network as much as an L2. An L2 to me means consumer protection exists, some central governance abstracted in the form of fraud proofs designed to be executed by trustless L1 validators.

For that to succeed it would have to be a better 'money' than ETH itself.. Which will be difficult to do with high inflation. I'd rather hold ETH long term above all others so I'm a lot more comfortable depositing it into apps and offering liquidity which fuels the ecosystem. Liquidity begets more liquidity and that's a difficult thing for new coins to overcome, seen in all the other L1's like ADA or DOT or SOL or whichever that have single percentage points of TVL held compared to ETH or its L2's.

I think at first L2's will absorb other L2's. Suppose it costs $5 to buy a blob today, basically any L2 with any basic compression scheme is able to launch and be profitable. Then one day if it costs $500 just the L2s with the most advanced compression and greatest demand can roll up enough transactions to remain both competitive and profitable. The $5 L2 will have to deploy as an L3 part of this more successful L2, something Optimism and Arbitrum seem to have thought of already when building their Superchain/Orbit networks. Beyond this future I still do not see even the most successful L2 launching as an independent L1, considering the cost/security/liquidity/centralization implications I mentioned above. 

Same argument 'why not' could be said about dApps too. Why doesn't Uniswap fork as a competing L1?

4346,2024-08-19,"1/6 measured in dollars. If you're worried about the dollar price then look at the dollar supply.

ETH was never supposed to be deflationary, that was not the purpose of the fee burn. Deflation was always just a side effect of egregiously high fees, and the aim of that is to incentivize less activity. Why disincentivize Ethereum's activity for no reason otherwise?

Why do you think ETH has to be deflationary for it to preform well, considering as you mention inflation was 4% before at the ATH?

You say 0.70% per year but it is actually measured to be -0.05% per year over the last 2 years. As per UltrasoundMoney. No need to use the past 7d to extrapolate a year average rather than simply looking back 1-year with how volitile gas is.

There's some 30x the amount of transactions per second taking place on L2's than is possible on L1. How is that not working for anyone? How are these L2's parasites when they're paying for blockspace in ETH and some of the largest burners of ETH?

Optimism is upgrading right now so every L2 part of its Superchain is composable with one another. Zora, Base, Optimism, plus 26 others. Polygon has something like this with their AggLayer too. The UX gets better as time passes. The end stage is every L2 is composable with every other. If you'd prefer to stay on L1 and pay $20-200 for a 'better UX' you're still absolutely free to do so.

The reason you hear lots of new terminology coming from Ethereum is because it's community are building new tech.

There are vastly more developers working in the Ethereum.ecosystem than on any other crypto, so it shouldn't be surprising that they are pushing out a lot of new ideas and features:

https://www.developerreport.com/

In fact, by looking at where new code is first deployed (i.e. novel, not just copy-pasted projects) you can see that 71% of all new developments in the whole of crypto happen first on Ethereum:

4487,2024-08-15,"Any wallet is, essentially, a GUI for (an) address(es). The Ethereum network exists in large part to run smart contracts, many of which we call ""tokens"". The most common Eth token standard is ERC-20. stETH is an ERC-20 token. In other words, it runs on the Ethereum network and can be held at any Ethereum address--and therefore interacted with via any Ethereum-compatible wallet software.

This is the token contract for stETH: [https://etherscan.io/token/0xae7ab96520de3a18e5e111b5eaab095312d7fe84](https://etherscan.io/token/0xae7ab96520de3a18e5e111b5eaab095312d7fe84)

stETH **should** be sent to an Eth address, because it's an Eth token. However, there are bazillions of different Eth tokens, so most wallets don't display all possible tokens by default, even though the associated address can handle all of them. The token is there at the address, but the wallet doesn't display it by default. So you need to ""add the token"", which just means ""tell your wallet software to pull the relevant info from the blockchain and display it"". As soon as you do this, you can interact with the token in question just like any other ERC-20 token (e.g., USDT, USDC...).

So, technically all Binance has to do is load the token contract for stETH and send it back to OP. It's trivially easy, but they have to actually do it (and I think they will; it just might take them awhile to get around to it).",positive,0.9055651,3

> 1: are there multiple Ethereum-compatible blockchain account or sites? in other words, is this just one wallet or different sources provide this?

There are lots of different Ethereum-compatible blockchains. These are things like Ethereum mainnet, Optimism, Polygon. Which one of these you choose will decide where your NFT data lives. To use one, you will need some of the money native to that blockchain, and you'll need the money to be on that chain. On Ethereum and Optimism this is ETH. On Polygon it's called MATIC. 

For the purposes of issuing and selling NFTs I would say that all the main ones are secure enough. The main issue is that you have to pay fees when you mint or sell your NFTs, which can get high on Ethereum mainnet (although they're currently low). If you're minting NFTs you'll want them to be on a blockchain where people want to buy it, so the main consideration will be which one is most popular for NFTs. (Which I don't know, sorry.)

However, these all use the same wallet. A wallet is a piece of software that allows you to interact with the blockchain. A typical wallet would be something like MetaMask or Rabby.

If you're looking to stake, as some of suggested, look at DappNode.

For the actual process, get an offline machine, preferably running Linux and use it to generate the validator keystores, etc. Also you can use the offline machine to generate the offline wallet using something like MyEthereumWallet and sign all transactions offline, transfer the signed transaction to an online machine and broadcast it there. Never expose the private keys for anything on an online machine. Use strong passwords, write everything down on paper as a backup and keep it safe.

You can look at coincashew's guide for more info, though that is staking directly using Linux instead of DappNode. You can also look at eth-docker.

biggest risk from choosing the token to stake is token risk - i.e. it goes down and doesn’t recover. it’s important to choose something you have conviction in appreciation over time - like ethereum.

4586,2024-08-11,"BTC is intentionally handicapped. It can't really do anything including facilitate a decentralized bridge... It's 2024 but Bitcoin is still living in 2009. People's entire plan for the future is to rely on centralization to facilitate any sort of scaling or features, eg the endgame of lighting is custodial/permissioned channels to reduce user fees, but I digress.

Starknet is working something up with zero knowledge proofs that would allow an L2 to persist on ETH and BTC simultaneously. Couldn't guess if it's months or years away though. They were the team who tried creating Bitcoin's first/only L2 but ended up doing it on Ethereum instead due to Bitcoin's super constrained language and throughput. There's been some breakthroughs with Starks since they launched on Ethereum that may work with BTC code, at least in theory. But even then, the BTC fees may be prohibitively expensive without further optimization/breakthroughs unfortunately - at least that was the case last time I did a deep dive into their research maybe a year ago.

Atomic swaps work well today for exchanging BTC to ETH or other coins. These are decentralized marketplaces, essentially. A couple wallets have it integrated in their swap feature. Exchange rates can be a bit off, nothing insane, but thus is the cost of P2P.

There are other decentralized marketplaces that facilitate crypto swaps such as Bisq. YMMV with fees but may be worth digging through kycnot.me to try and find something suitable for your needs.

If you just want exposure to BTC for price stability but want fast access to DeFi, wBTC (wrapped Bitcoin) may be a good fit for you. Exchange rates are nearly exactly 1:1. It's not maximally decentralized (compared to Bitcoin or Ethereum), iirc the bridge is controlled by a DAO so it's not something I'd 'hodl' for years in place of BTC.

Ultimately you still have TTF when you are receiving assets, it's just how the blockchain works.  There is good and bad in everything and even CEXs have some benefits.  CEXs are just shuffling money on their own books 99% of the time so you aren't actually using crypto nor interacting with blockchains when you use a CEX so you can benefit from the speed of a centralized system.

Especially if they've contacted you outside of public channels away from scrutiny, or want you to download anything or connect your wallet somewhere you don't trust and understand absolutely. Always compare information gathered from one person or source against multiple other sources, aka DYOR.

>First of all, does it matter which app someone is going to use to create his DeFi wallet? Does it make any difference (in security or any other) if I create my defi wallet via metamask or coinbase or exodus or some other app?

These are all different hot wallets. Your private key will be stored in a file on your device in all of these cases. If you have malware or an insecure PC this file will inevitably make its way online into someone else's hands.

Maintaining good operational security (opsec) is the most important thing over choosing a wallet. That means don't store your seed phrase or keys in a cloud-based password manager or email server or notepad file, don't download suspicious torrents, don't run random exe files, don't open pdf's from untrusted sources, have an anti-virus (Windows Defender is fine). Mostly, practice common sense.

Generally it doesn't matter which wallet you use, any hot wallet should be fine, but it can sometimes matter. There have been cases where users of certain wallets (see: Atomic Wallet) have mysteriously had their funds drained in private key exploits, presumably by a backdoor of sorts (potentially bad/known RNG) due to how widespread it was. Reputation is everything in crypto, the longer a wallet (or app or blockchain) has been widely used the probability for there are security flaws within it decreases.

Personally I use whichever has the best UX for my needs. Rabby is really great for newbies with its scam/spam protection, it can simulate transactions to see if they will fail beforehand, it also automatically adds new L2 networks and tokens. MetaMask is an OG wallet with more advanced settings but hasn't updated its UX in years. I use Coinbase wallet mainly to interact with dApps or the Base-L2 on my phone, plus it has really great integration with their exchange for very fast deposits and withdraws.

>Secondly, no matter where I created my defi wallet, I can import it to another defi app, for example I can create it via coinbase and then import it to metamask, is there any impact to the wallet when you import it on different apps? (Is this info stored somewhere? Does it make it easier to compromise?)

Your private key is what you use to access your public key address on the blockchain. You can import this key into any wallet to access the same address. Your funds are never stored inside a wallet, you should think of them more like a keyring (that's what they were almost named) and you're simply copying keys that each unlock the same door.

There is a 'derivation path' standard on Ethereum for which your private key is derived from your 12-25 word seed phrase, but for dumb reasons not every wallet adheres to it. I don't think you can import some hardware wallet seed phrases into a hot wallet and generate the same key pair. I think every hot wallet uses the same path though, meaning a wallet created in Coinbase can be imported into Exodus or MetaMask or Rabby and vice versa and pull up the same accounts.

Whenever you back up a wallet copy down both your private key and your seed phrase, for long term storage it's worth it to note which wallet was used and its software version too. Using the private key should always work but it's inconvenient and impractical. Using the seed will work 99% of the time. If for some reason the seed doesn't work and you didn't save the private key, you can search online which derivation path the software wallet used and with a wallet like MEW (the OG OG wallet with the most settings) generate the private key using your seed and the custom derivation path.

It should be no easier to compromise your private key by having it on 1 wallet or 5 wallets on the same machine. If you start importing it onto different machines, the weakest link is what's holding everything up.

""DeFi app's"" are things like GMX or Uniswap. They're smart contracts, essentially scripts, that persist on the blockchain, that you use your wallet to interact with. Every hot wallet can interact with DeFi apps, there's not really such a thing as a DeFi wallet.

>Bonus question about railgun: I have read multitple posts about it, is it used only to hide your coins or is it a method to increase security on your wallet too? Is it better to keep the coins shielded or it doesn't matter?

Hide your coins. Adding additional steps into your process necessarily decreases your security, it's the difference between trusting A and B won't fail or A and B and C... I have no experience with it to say if it's trusted or not. If I was going to send you money and didn't want you to see my wallet balances I'd use an app such as this, if I was just interacting with dApps on my own there's no need.

Since you're new and just getting into crypto, and eager to learn, it's worth mentioning that most of these wallets will become obsolete in the next 1-5 years anyway. Account abstraction is on the horizon, using your phone or CPU's security enclave (the offline-chip it uses to securely manage your passwords, same as a hardware wallet) to generate your keys if not some form of email+password+MFA. This will enable you to create an account with a service or website and use those credentials instead for your wallet credentials.

4636,2024-08-10,"Which wallet mostly matters when it comes to using it, metamask is the most common and almost all dapps will connect to it. More obscure wallets might not be able to connect to many dapps. You can generally use the same seed phrase on multiple wallets, unless they use some non standard derivation or a different number of seed words. I have the same seed in metamask, Rabby and I think math and c98 wallets. Be careful using obscure wallets as that might expose your crypto on all wallets using that seed. For example, awhile back a Solana wallet provider called Slope was exposing their users seeds by sending lists of these seeds across the net unencrypted when there was no valid reason for them to even be keeping a copy. The users didn't know they were doing this until a copy was intercepted and thousands of wallets were drained, including mine. So choose your wallet provider carefully or better yet use a hardware wallet like a ledger. The nano X can be connected to metamask, Rabby, Phantom etc even on mobile and allow access to all the dapps without risking your private key and seed phrase to the wallet providers.

Run a node, generate staking key, [sign the staking contract](https://launchpad.ethereum.org/en/). Can be done in any computer with 2TB SSD and 32GB RAM. I made a [video guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpB0h9_XWvQ) for windows.

Meaning Ethereum has been designed for the free market to extend its utility in every novel way, while their rollup can still maintain ETH's security and decentralization. Effectively to sidestep the slow and relatively small team of core developers.

Bug Arbitrum or Optimism if you want a business mindset. Or Blast, or Mantle, Scroll, Starknet, Taiko, Polygon, Loopring, on and on and on. The list grows every day.

https://l2beat.com/scaling/summary

Solana's CEO (smh already) has said repeatedly new coin issuance is not a cost to the network. According to Anatoly if he mints 10T SOL and dumped it in secret, that's A-OK. And he lied about SOL's total supply by like 3x already, since due to their immense centralization no one was/is able to audit the chain, what not even a year ago? They're being investigated by the CFTC and SEC for this. Let's see how well your 'business roadmap' ages first maybe.

Hint: a commodity (which any decentralized crypto asset truly is) doesn't and can't have a 'business roadmap'

The EF focusing on research is the best thing for Ethereum. Besides that, the roadmap in place will make Solana obsolete fairly soon. Look into danksharding, into the verge, into zero knowledge proofs, into based rollups, most of which the free market is developing on their own utilizing EF-funded research.

The Eclipse L2 uses the Solana virtual machine but doesn't go offline since it settles to Ethereum, as just one example of what the EF can't and shouldn't be doing but we're getting anyway.

Ethereum is too big and valuable to make drastic or risky changes even semi frequently. If ETH went offline just once then value would cease to settle on it and it'd be relegated forever to being a shitcoin casino, kind of like Solana...

Maybe you signed a transaction but the gas set was too low, then later the market gas price dropped in that range and your original transaction finally got processed.

Transactions all have a nonce number attached and they go up in order. 1 2 3 4 5. If you make a transaction, say nonce#10, and it hasn't gone through for whatever reason, even if you make transactions #11 #12 #13 so on with higher gas that should go through, they will all be held up until #10 goes through first. While they're held up your wallet would display your balance as if #10 hasn't gone through, because at that point it still hasn't. To unfreeze a transaction you'd look at your public address on Etherscan to find the nonce# of the pending transaction, then open advanced settings in your wallet and turn on 'custom nonce', and send a new transaction using the stuck tx's nonce#... Any transaction, even sending yourself 0ETH will overwrite that stuck one and free up the rest of your transactions, or you could resend the same transaction using higher gas, or in your case replace it with your new Etherfi transaction.

""This is a variant of the advance fee scam. The scammer will often use a stolen social media account to increase their credibility. A scammer will contact an artist, and ask to purchase one of their works of art (paintings, digital media or photos), and they will offer a generous sum of money. It can take three forms: a fake payment email (in which you're instructed to pay some fee to receive the money), a fake check (in which you're asked to forward some money elsewhere), or a fake NFT minting scam.

In this latest variant, the scammer suggests to buy the art piece in NFT form. The victim is instructed to mint the NFT in a fake minting website, which charges money for the fuel (as any NFT minting service does).

Keep 1 wallet as your creator wallet.. the 1 people know is holding the token and guiding the community, the other wallet contains a moddest amount so you can reap some of the rewards and not just the community who sells... both ideas are a good way for extra income..only issue with nfts i think is harder to market and get people to see it..everything is set to advertise your memecoin these days",positive,0.92411786,1

>The most important trend in STARK protocol design over the last two years has been the switch to working over small fields. The earliest production implementations of STARKs worked over 256-bit fields - arithmetic modulo large numbers such as 21888...95617 \(\approx 1.51 * 2^{253}\) - which made these protocols naturally compatible with verifying elliptic curve-based signatures, and made them easy to reason about. But this led to inefficiency: in most cases we don't actually have good ways to make use of these larger numbers, and so they ended up as mostly wasted space, and even more wasted computation, since arithmetic over 4x bigger numbers takes ~9x more computation time. To deal with this, STARKs have started working over smaller fields: first Goldilocks (modulus \(2^{64} - 2^{32} + 1\)) and then Mersenne31 and BabyBear (\(2^{31} - 1\) and \(2^{31} - 2^{27} + 1\), respectively).

Second, it's also false.

I prove that's false [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tspGVbmMmVA&t=2557s) and I talk about why it's false both with Bitcoin and Ethereum specifically.

This idea that you don't have to ""ask permission"" to use your assets is absurd.  You are leaving out literally dozens of third parties whose resources you need to even access your crypto.  

Just being able to access the Internet itself, isn't some universal human right that's available to all.  You take it all for granted.

It's utterly mind boggling how and why you'd suggest crypto is ""P2P when no two peers involved in a transaction even contact each other.

4983,2024-07-30,"> Task 1: I want to make a piece of content - like a video or something - and I want to prove in the video itself that it happened after date/time X

This is called ""authentication"" and you guys act like you invented it.  I hate to break it to you but it's been around long before blockchain.  The technology that blockchain uses for ""authentication"" does not require blockchain: It's called cryptographic hashing and it's been in use routinely to authenticate content.  You don't need Eth or blockchain to do that.  Since the dawn of computing, it's been used.  It's most basic level started the moment two computers started talking to each other with something called ""checksums"" which were used to authenticate data in both directions.

Again, there's *nothing* blockchain brings to that.   You can use a regular database to keep track of the same data, and you can hash date and timestamps as well.

>and I want to prove in the video itself that it happened after date/time X

Funny thing about dates and times.  Blockchain doesn't give a shit about time.  It doesn't keep track of dates and times, only blocks.  Dates and times are a function of... wait for it... *central authorities* like the National Institute of Standards and Time, which servers all over the world use for synchronization.   So at virtually every point in the blockchain process, it's dependent upon central authorities who use their services *with permission*.

> 2 years later someone can say, oh but that video did not happen after date X it happend before date X. 

Assuming the dates are accurate, and if they are, they will be the result of two specific, non-decentralized entities:

1.  The person who input the data to the blockchain (oracle #1)
2.  The date/time authority that (i.e. time.nist.gov) that gave the server the correct date/time.

Again, all of this can be done with traditional databases faster and cheaper.  

Another problem is, there's no guarantee your blockchain will be operational two years from now.  There is no guarantee the random, anonymous, self-interested node operators will continue to run the nodes.  Since there is no accountability in crypto due to its decentralized nature, there's nobody in charge to make sure the blockchain keeps running.  The moment the value of the tokens drops low enough, long enough, then there's no incentive anymore for the blockchain to exist.  There are already 30,000+ copies of BTC and ETH that no longer exist because nobody is running their blockchains any more.   Just because Eth is popular now, doesn't mean it will be in the future.  You have no guarantee of that.

>Task 2: Lets say I make a video and keep it secret and only release it in 2 years. How can I convice a reasonable person behind resonable doubt, that the video was created before date/time X.

This is basically the same argument as your earlier argument.  Those hashes don't need to be stored on blockchain - they can be stored in various other places.  

And of course, any concept of ""dates"" and ""times"" is a function of central authorities, so ironically you can't exercise your fantasy scenario without depending upon middlemen that are regulated and subsidized by government.

So, your argument fails.

* It fails because it depends on various centralized/entities to report what is the proper date/time (The Oracle Problem)

4986,2024-08-02,"You are fundamentally misunderstanding the value proposition of crypto (and specifically a chain like Ethereum)

You are thinking of it purely in terms of technological replacement value. As in, how is the technology better at doing a specific task than the technology that exists today? Crypto is net new technology. It isn’t like AI, which is an incremental improvement - computers doing what we could already do better and more efficiently.

The promise of crypto is decentralized consensus. It’s coordination at a global scale. To use your database argument as an example, Ethereum isn’t trying to just be a database, it’s trying to be THE database. A singular world computer - a source of truth for all transactions that ever happen in the world. There’s tremendous value in that.

Does it sound crazy? Yes. Does it sound impossible? Yes. But so did the idea of the internet in the early days. There were many people that uttered the same criticisms 40 years ago - “why do we need the internet when televisions and the radio exists?” 

Sounds pretty familiar to “why do we need crypto when databases and auth already exist?” 

Source: I am a seasoned software engineer that has deep domain knowledge on one of the most popular database technologies in the world. I understand databases and authentication at a deeper level than 99% of engineers. These technologies are quite literally our modern day radio and television. They serve our needs and purposes today, but they are horribly inefficient for coordinating at a global scale. I’m not saying Ethereum or any other crypto has gotten even close, but a secure source of truth “database” for the entire world is a game changer.",positive,0.90059775,1
4987,2024-08-03,"> You are fundamentally misunderstanding the value proposition of crypto (and specifically a chain like Ethereum)

Ok... let's see you explain to me what I'm not understanding?

>The promise of crypto is decentralized consensus. 

This is a vague abstraction.  

You guys love to talk in vague abstractions because it's difficult to qualify your ambiguous claims as being true/false when they're so un-specific.   

What is ""consensus"" in the context of crypto?  You don't answer that.  

How is ""consensus"" qualified off chain?  You don't answer that.  

You pretend the whole world runs on Solidity, which is absurd.  You haven't drawn a single, clear line of how what happens on blockchain, results from any meaningful form of ""consensus"" in the real world.

And yes, even with your vague techno-babble, I fully understand what you're trying to say.  I have a section in my documentary where I specifically debunk your claims [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tspGVbmMmVA&t=916s).

You hide behind Begging the Question logical fallacies.  Two in particular in this argument:

1.  Decentralizing something is supposed to be inherently better - You haven't proven that.  I debunk that claim [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tspGVbmMmVA&t=783s).
2.  Consensus works in the world of crypto and blockchain - I debunk that in the earlier link, which is all part of my section on decentralization and what it promises and why it doesn't deliver.

13 minutes into my documentary, I address this issue.  I go into explicit details on how and why blockchain isn't decentralized in any meaningful way.  I also explain that blockchain's consensus mechanism is flawed and incomplete.

So while you say

>The promise of crypto is decentralized consensus. 

You don't go into any specifics on how that argument actually works.  I have, and it falls apart when you apply it to any real world application.

At [35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tspGVbmMmVA&t=2108s) in my documentary I go into a very specific use-case for blockchain that's very commonly cited: supply chain tracking.  We take a real world example of how blockchain would be used, and I prove blockchain adds *nothing* of value to the application.  Nobody has found any faults in my arguments or evidence, which is why I just get called names - my data is solid.  

>Does it sound crazy? Yes. Does it sound impossible? Yes. But so did the idea of the internet in the early days. There were many people that uttered the same criticisms 40 years ago - “why do we need the internet when televisions and the radio exists?” 

Again, with absolutely ABSURD ANALOGIES.

From the moment the Internet, radio or television was invented, the value it brought to society was obvious.  We didn't need people saying for 15 years, ""Just wait... the internet will do cool stuff you need!""   From the moment the Internet came along, we recognized services like e-mail were a dramatic improvement over existing tech like US Mail and fax machines.   Even though it took many years for the Internet to propagate to more people, the value of the tech *was obvious from the very beginning*.

The same can **not** be said for blockchain.

Stop pretending blockchain has anywhere near the potential of actually disruptive technology.  That's a lie.

>Source: I am a seasoned software engineer that has deep domain knowledge on one of the most popular database technologies in the world. I understand databases and authentication at a deeper level than 99% of engineers. These technologies are quite literally our modern day radio and television. 

I'm a software engineer too, and I can quite confidently state, you don't know what the fuck you're talking about.

I produced a [detailed documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tspGVbmMmVA) filled with specific examples and references that debunk all the bullshit talking points you've made.

I've also interviewed well-regarded computer science experts like [Dr. Nicholas Weaver](https://ioradio.org/2023/07/25/io-radio-13-interview-with-computer-science-professor-and-crypto-critic-dr-nicholas-weaver/) at Berkeley who 100% agrees with me about blockchain.

All you do is make bad analogies, fallacious claims, and avoid anything specific enough to be tested true/false.

You should quit your day job and find another line of work because if you think blockchain is like tv or radio, you're not qualified to build any type of mission critical technology.",positive,0.80227935,1

5011,2024-07-30,"First, be very skeptical of everyone and anyone giving you an answer. Second, trust the people who actually wrote the software you are using. In order to open those files go to the go-ethereum github repository. Under the /cmd directory there is a program named ethkey - see here: [https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/tree/master/cmd/ethkey](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/tree/master/cmd/ethkey)

If you build this program, you can decrypt these keys if you know the password. This is a command line interface program. Once you have built the program you can open the files like this:

ethkey inspect KEYFILE --private

To use it replace KEYFILE with the actual filename.

If you do not know how to build a go based program, you can learn super easy. First, install go by using their website:

[https://go.dev/doc/install](https://go.dev/doc/install)

Once installed you can download the repository for go-ethereum and navigate a command line interface program to the go-ethereum source code location. Then navigate to the /cmd/ethkey directory. Once in that directory, you can just type:

go run . KEYFILE --private

This works to just run the ethkey program without installing and building it by having go build it in memory and run the program for you to use. If you have questions about any of these steps, just ask. Happy to help on the details. 

The reason I am suggesting this route is that all of the resources I am naming are nothing more than a well known programming language ( goLang ) and the actual go-ethereum repository - which is made by the ethereum core devs. In this way you do not have to trust anyone other than the devs who make go, and the devs who made ethereum. 

Once you have that private key, you can import it to any number of wallets including metamask, etherwallet, etc. 

If you are dealing with small values metamask is probably fine. If you are dealing with large values, look for other wallet like etherwallet. 

ALWAYS VERIFY YOU ARE DOWNLOADING THE ACTUAL WALLET FROM THE ORIGINAL SOURCE.

As gov't fiat enters the game, the entire crypto world will split into two systems: auditable and non-auditable (Light and Dark).  The former will be strictly regulated but enjoy interoperability with traditional financial systems, while the latter will be confined to P2P/DEX systems and heavily villified as ""dark money"", in order to preserve gov't ability to devalue the currency.

Currency devaluation is a requirement of consumption-based Keynesian economics because it disincentivizes saving.  In fiat, currency devaluation is typically achieved via inflation (increasing the total money supply).  In Light, it will happen via opaque stablecoin collateralization strategies.  Ideally, Dark would be the anchor which limits the rate of devaluation of Light currencies via exchange rate: the immediate public knowledge of the actual value of money (similar function to how gold, forex, etc. does now with fiat, but more accurate and without latency).

When Dark becomes the oracle for the true value of Light, the Light stablecoins lose their pegs, and the US gov't loses its ability to control the ecosystem through stablecoin manipulation.  When the gov't can no longer manipulate incentives with stealth-tax via devaluation, it is forced to budget responsibly; the Keynesian Casino closes and the USD-based world economy collapses.  Unacceptable.  They will first try to impede Dark-Light trades via regulation, e.g. sanctioning of Tornado Cash, backdooring CEXs, etc... and failing that, will use every weapon at their disposal to shutdown, invalidate, and arrest Dark nodes, wallets, and users.

Meanwhile, if you wish to stay in good graces with Light, you should really be making a new wallet for every transaction to avoid inadvertently tainting yourself with Darkness.  In this way, you can continue to operate in both systems.  Imagine you wish to purchase groceries at a store which only accepts Light, but your aggregate Light balance is insufficient and you need to pull tokens from your Dark balance.  You will need to use a cross-ramp to transfer from Dark to Light, in a way which is invisible to the grocery store.

The gov't will do everything in its power to prevent cross-ramps in the name of fighting money laundering, and it will likely play out in a cat-and-mouse game between Light and Dark actors, as new categories are invented which semantically dodge those of the laws and regulations.  Light will eventually win this game (by cheating via corrupt judiciary) and Dark will be confined to bartering systems.

5100,2024-07-28,"This is something that needs to be worked on. When the staking spec was first realized ETH was trading around $100, so the emergence and sudden dominance of staking pools wasn't a large concern at the time.

https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/staking_2023_10

https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2023/09/30/enshrinement.html

>In the short term, one option is to socially encourage ecosystem participants to use a diversity of liquid staking providers, to reduce the chance that any single one becomes too large to be a systemic risk. In the longer term, however, this is an unstable equilibrium, and there is peril in relying too much on moralistic pressure to solve problems. One natural question arises: might it make sense to enshrine some kind of in-protocol functionality to make liquid staking less centralizing?

It's a hot research topic today but not really anyone's priority right now. Reminder, it requires 66.67% of all ETH stake to ""51% attack"" the network in a similar way to Bitcoin. Once PBS goes live (to 'solve' MEV centralization concerns) I believe this will become the next target for all-hands-on development.

One proposal that should go through before any real 'fix' is deployed will enable better protections and controls for delegates (ie stETH and rETH holders). Though the research topics escape my mind right now.

The reason Bitcoiners don't believe 2 pools controlling 51% of the hashrate is an issue, but point to it being an issue in Ethereum's POS, is miners are able to stop contributing toward a malicious pool and redirect their hashrate in the event of an attack, whereas ETH delegates more or less have their ETH held hostage at the attacking validator's mercy.

Currently only a validator has the ability to unstake their node. The research I've read aims to enable delegates the function to force their validators to unstake and exit. In the event a staking pool turns malicious (or goes offline) LST holders would be able retrieve their ETH simply by withdrawing/redeeming LST for ETH via smart contract. This would be done without permission or waiting for the validator to exit on their own, in turn removing the malicious validators from the network. This would at least offer Ethereum LST the same protection miners have against malicious POW pools. I think this won't be contentious or complicated and should come soon (TM) long before any seriously robust solution is figured out.

However, I've never liked the assumption miners (or stakers) are paying careful attention to their nodes on a block-by-block basis. I think Bitcoin is still hugely susceptible to being 51% attacked today (which according to the Nakomoto coefficient, is any disruption to the network). Knowing most miners/stakers are ignorant/hands-off/idle/on vacation/greedy/lazy/etc. relying on them to take action the second an attack occurs is massively niave, so I'd hope a better solution emerges soon still (possibly some form of LST Enshrinement as per Vitalik's blog above).

Myself, I think the attack vector is growing. If these new US ETFs accumulate say $100B ETH then convert to staked ETFs, it would make Lido seem totally decentralized in contrast. One defense against this is the staking queue, meaning it would take some years for that much ETH to convert to staked ETH, but I'd rather people didn't wait until last-minute to decide this may become problematic.",positive,0.90770495,5

5104,2024-07-28,"33.34% of the total stake and an attacker can stop Ethereum from finalizing transactions. It's worth mentioning here that Bitcoin never achieves finality and its blockchain is instead only ever 'probabilistic', which is why people and exchanges wait 30-60+ minutes before saying a BTC transaction is (probably) correct. Ethereum didn't achieve finality for the first time until it migrated to POS, most (POW and POS) chains don't have finality at all.

Without achieving finality, Ethereum POS starts to bleed all stakers with inactivity leaks. This gradually would push the 33.34%'s stake downward until they no longer have 33.34% control, at which point the network would achieve finality and carry on as normal again. Losing even 0.1% of the total ETH stake is a massive cost, about $120M currently, and if a 33.34% attacker attempts to fork or manipulate the chain they would lose 100% of their stake via automated slashing.

This defense mechanism is explained in much better detail on the Ethereum link you posted. 

Without finality, users would not notice any difference in their day to day transactions. The blockchain would still be 100% live during that sort of event. It would not really disrupt the network, other than stakers vocal outrage as they're experiencing inactivity leaks due to some other malicious entity.

There was actually a bug in the Prisym client a few months back that prevented Ethereum from achieving finality, that was quickly fixed, but it meant the chain didn't achieve finality for about an hour. Few noticed.

At any point up to 66.667%, due the nature of POS, there could be a social slashing event. This means people vote the attacker out of the network by forking the chain without the attackers validator set being part of the new fork. I don't think it'd be needed during a 33% attack, but it's still a viable option. In contrast to POW where it's impossible to remove an attacking entity without changing the hashing algorithm, which would render current ASICs useless and destroy its whole security model.

All that said, I personally consider Lido to be a malicious entity themselves. Most staking pools have voted to self-limit their share to 22% but Lido has stated they see no issue if they controlled 100%. There's research and work being done on how to mitigate this risk, relying on altruism isn't a real solution. One proposal aims to reduce rewards to colluding validators which would give the free market incentives not to use them. Still, a permanent solution to totally prevent self-centralization (even just to the point of 33%, but at least 66%) is hard to imagine.",positive,0.57313806,7

The fact that bitcoin is not P2P is another separate issue.  I explained why that was false - did you not see what I wrote?  I'll copy it below:

>crypto is not P2P... in fact the two peers who transfer crypto never communicate with each other - instead they go through a myriad of third parties maintaining the blockchain

With bitcoin, you have 2 peers who never interact.  Instead they interact with third-party nodes running the blockchain who change the centralized database that is the blockchain, then the two peers check the blockchain to see what's changed.  It's not actually peer TO peer.  It's peer-to-middleman and other-peer-to-middleman.  That's how it works.  It doesn't fit the traditional definition of peer-to-peer in any meaningful way.

This is yet another example of  how crypto bros make up their own definition of words that have other meanings in the real world.  P2P has a specific meaning - peers talk to each other.  This does NOT happen with Bitcoin.  Comprende?

If you don't understand that, then you don't understand crypto & blockchain and we can't have an intelligent discussion.

If you disagree that it isn't P2P, explain to me how 2 peers communicate with *each other* (and no middlemen) during a bitcoin transaction?  That's not the way it works and I challenge you to demonstrate otherwise.",positive,0.70488703,1

In normal conditions, stETH gets postive rebase which mean the balance is increasing.

If few slashing events take place and the (instant and subsequent) losses could be covered by the rewards, stakers' stETH still gets positive rebase.

If there is a massive slashing event, stETH may get negetive rebase, which means stETH balance could decrease.

5556,2024-07-16,"rETH works the same as the other poster described with Lido.

Only difference being on Rocket Pool validators are required to put up (minimum) 10% collateral before participating. In case of bad or malicious validation this collateral is taken away from first (and the validator removed from the Ethereum network) before the Rocket Pool network experiences any penalties. If some% of validators are slashed beyond this 10%, as an rETH holder you'd notice a temporary decrease in APR but wouldn't be slashed yourself. Only if a large% of validators are slashed at the same time would the ETH backing the rETH pool be affected, meaning how much ETH you can redeem your rETH for.

I outlined the most likely case for a large slashing event in my other post. The other case for mass slashing would be majority collusion, which I don't think is likely at all. Either case would be extremely bad for Ethereum and most (not all) stakers..

Client diversity is KEY (ie *not* using a majority client). Since RP is permissionless I can only assume not all validators are using the same one client... The minority of validators still online after a mass slashing event would receive a great boost in staking rewards, so the rETH APR would increase 2-3fold despite its value decreasing proportionately to how much ETH was slashed - too many variables to guess when/if those two would balance out, but with an APR under 10% it would probably take a very long time.",neutral,0.6189736,2

5561,2024-07-17,"https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/rewards-and-penalties/

>There are three ways a validator can be slashed, all of which amount to the dishonest proposal or attestation of blocks:

>By proposing and signing two different blocks for the same slot

>By attesting to a block that ""surrounds"" another one (effectively changing history)

>By ""double voting"" by attesting to two candidates for the same block

>If these actions are detected, the validator is slashed. This means that 1/32 of their staked ether (up to a maximum of 1 ether) is immediately burned, then a 36 day removal period begins. During this removal period the validator's stake gradually bleeds away. At the mid-point (Day 18) an additional penalty is applied whose magnitude scales with the total staked ether of all slashed validators in the 36 days prior to the slashing event. This means that when more validators are slashed, the magnitude of the slash increases. The maximum slash is the full effective balance of all slashed validators (i.e. if there are lots of validators being slashed they could lose their entire stake). On the other hand, a single, isolated slashing event only burns a small portion of the validator's stake. This midpoint penalty that scales with the number of slashed validators is called the ""correlation penalty"".

There is also what's called an inactivity leak. This is different from slashing generally, but can result in lost ETH as well. If your validator is offline or misconfigured for any reason you experience this leak, it is about proportional to the amount of rewards earned through a day - ie being offline for 7 days you will need to be online for 7 days to break even once again. This leak also occurs whenever the chain is unable to reach finality, which I'll go into below..

https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/attack-and-defense/

Ethereum uses a 66.67% consensus majority. This means even if 33.34% if the network is in disagreement with the majority, the majority can be slashed and removed from the network. It also means if 33.34% is in disagreement the chain cannot finalize and inactivity leaks begin until the 33.34% falls under its 1/3 majority naturally over time.

Validators are also able to manually slash other validators. This happens during attestation when validators are randomly selected to verify the last series of blocks (during each epoch, 6 minutes, how long it takes for the chain reach tx finality). The validator who detects a phony or malicious block is able to collect the slashing reward for themselves, which are typically just burned in all other cases. This leads to a prisoners dellima of sorts which is good for security (making collusion effectively impossible, either lie and help break Ethereum or be honest for a large reward).

The slashing consequences and network behavior differ when 34-50-67% of the network is in disagreement with each other. 

Note: Rocketpool has voted to limit themselves at IIRC 20% of the total ETH stake, as part of a coordinated effort from most staking services to maintain Ethereum's integrity/robustness. Lido on the other hand has claimed there is no issue if they gain 100% of the total stake, this is their business model - some see Lido as a malicious entity as a result and advise against its usage, in part due to their centralization.

It's in the cases of a 50-66.65% fork being rejected that would result in the most lost ETH. About 55% of validators are using GETH currently, so other than a very contentious action happening I believe a critical GETH error is the only way that could manifest as of today. There is an effort to get people to use minority clients, some EIPs are proposed that would increase validator yields for doing such, but people are always complacent and slow to act.. Assuming 75% of Rocket Pool validators are using GETH a validator mass slashing event that rejected GETH validators would result in rETH being backed with 25% the ETH that it should be.

A contentious action may be something along the lines of USDT demanding validators use their modified execution client which grants them a 0.1% tax of every transaction, or else will not honor USDT redemptions any longer. 67% of validators may have greater than 32ETH worth of USDT on DeFi so would be incentivized to choose this new client and fork choice to maximize profit/minimize loss. This is extremely unlikely, especially as there's more ETH at stake than USDT in circulation, but just one quick example I could think of.

>If 1/3 or more of the staked ether is maliciously attesting or failing to attest, then a 2/3 supermajority cannot exist and the chain cannot finalize. The defense against this is the inactivity leak. The inactivity leak identifies those validators that are failing to attest or attesting contrary to the majority. The staked ether owned by these non-attesting validators is gradually bled-away until eventually they collectively represent less than 1/3 of the total so that the chain can finalize again.

>The purpose of the inactivity leak is to get the chain finalizing again. However, the attacker also loses a portion of their staked ether. Persistent inactivity across validators representing 33% of the total staked ether is very expensive even though the validators are not slashed.

>At 50% of the staked ether, a mischievous group of validators could theoretically split the chain into two equally sized forks and then simply use their entire 50% stake to vote contrarily to the honest validator set, thereby maintaining the two forks and preventing finality. The inactivity leak on both forks would eventually lead both chains to finalize. At this point, the only option is to fall back on a social recovery.

>At >50% of the total stake the attacker could dominate the fork choice algorithm. In this case, the attacker would be able to attest with the majority vote, giving them sufficient control to do short reorgs without needing to fool honest clients. The honest validators would follow suit because their fork choice algorithm would also see the attacker’s favored chain as the heaviest, so the chain could finalize. This enables the attacker to censor certain transactions, do short-range reorgs and extract maximum MEV by reordering blocks in their favor. The defense against this is the huge cost of a majority stake (currently just under $83 billion USD) which is put at risk by an attacker because the social layer is likely to step in and adopt an honest minority fork, devaluing the attacker’s stake dramatically.

>An attacker with 66% or more of the total staked ether can finalize their preferred chain without having to coerce any honest validators. The attacker can simply vote for their preferred fork and then finalize it, simply because they can vote with a dishonest supermajority. As the supermajority stakeholder, the attacker would always control the contents of the finalized blocks, with the power to spend, rewind and spend again, censor certain transactions and reorg the chain at will. By purchasing additional ether to control 66% rather than 51%, the attacker is effectively buying the ability to do ex post reorgs and finality reversions (i.e. change the past as well as control the future). The only real defenses here are the enormous cost of 66% of the total staked ether, and the option to fall back to the social layer to coordinate adoption of an alternative fork. We can explore this in more detail in the next section.",positive,0.6673335,2
