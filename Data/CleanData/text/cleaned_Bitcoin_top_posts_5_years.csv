This is what happens when a dishonest company needs more capital fast and the chances of your RH BTC positions being non-collateralized have literally never been higher. Further, the chances of RH failing as a company have never been higher.

Look into the faces of the young CEOs who made their fortunes by deceiving retail investors and selling them out via order flow. Do you really want to let these guys hold your BTC?

For the next 24 hours I will personally answer any questions that any of you may have about liquidating your RH positions and getting into a real exchange or decentralized marketplace (like BISQ)

""And why??""

32,2021-03-17,"Warning: STOP buying Bitcoin on Robinhood. These guys almost went under to a 3b margin call on illegal $GME paper trades. They will rob you and go broke.If this applies to you, seriously what are you thinking? We’ve been shouting “don’t buy BTC on RH” from the rooftops. The latest update is finding out that RH has admitted to paper trading $GME and fucking investors when their naked positions caught a 3 billion dollar margin call.

If this had been a Bitcoin related event, there would have been no recovery, RH would have filed for bankruptcy and relied on their elite friends to manage any government intervention that may crop up.

 RH basically shorted every order their client’s made, not only stabbing those clients in the back short term, but setting them up to lose everything if they were right. If $GME had gone to $1,000 some of these folks would have been left with less than their buy-in because RH would have gone under.

Returning to Bitcoin, it’s important to understand that this deceptive practice is even more easily perpetrated against RH’s BTC buyers and that Congress / regulators are even less likely to do anything about it.

For the love of Satoshi, I know at least one of you reading this is still not selling the Bitcoin you have on RH, transferring your fiat to a legitimate exchange, rebuying the Bitcoin, and storing it off exchange. Stupid games, stupid prizes, and you can’t be entirely dumb if you’ve read this far. Make the move right now and sleep better knowing your coins are safe and so is the integrity of the Bitcoin ecosystem. 

Other exchanges to consider include: Gemini, Kraken, Binance US, Coinsebase Pro, Swan, and if you’re a real legend BISQ. 

If this is your first time hearing this stuff, search r/Bitcoin for Robinhood and checkout this recent r/wallstreetbets thread detailing RH’s 3 billion dollar margin call https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m74e3g/this_is_huge_robinhood_never_owned_your_gme/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

TL:DR - RH probably isn’t buying Bitcoin when you buy Bitcoin on RH. If Bitcoin rallies hard enough, or if RH has an internal problem, you’re likely to lose everything. Move your funds off of RH.",positive,0.7425272,11246

120,2021-09-20,"Friend dropped out of college to day trade because he believes he can predict the charts using astrology.Ive been completing nursing school with a good buddy of mine for a while now. We have one year left. Last year I got into crypto around christmas time and I told him about it too. He has taken this so much further than I ever thought. I like to stick to my guns and just accumulate and hodl. 

He is convinced that he can use astrology to predict the charts down to the cent and day with the moon. Yes, Astrology. 

He has since dropped out of school, and is basically committing all his time to astrology and the markets. 

Does anyone else think like this? Am I the crazy one? Or is he?

Edit: I see lots of posts asking ""well is it working"" 

You see. I dont really know. He insists it is, says he knows what hes doing and that his past predictions are all right. I keep saying to lmk what the next one is and ill believe him. Except he never does. He just messages me at 4 am saying ""btc at *** told ya! Just like I said"". Or he says he told someone else that they should pull out and back in on X date and it worked for them. But I havent seen any proof.

Edit 2: he is not playing the stock market. This is all cryptos.

Edit 3: BREAKING 7:39pm ct. His latest call is that RIGHT NOW here. Is the bottom of the BTC correction from today. Current price now : $41,784. Around march or April is when the next bear market will be

Edit 4: just now he changed his mind, now saying that it is gonna drop again one more time between tonight and tomorrow. To 37500 or 30000. Lets see",positive,0.89516944,6725

140,2021-04-19,"Ten Bitcoin lessons from someone who's been around here since 2013**Lesson 1:** Stop thinking it’s too late. We haven’t even seen the tip of the iceberg. Even in 2013, people would say ""Those that bought in 2012 were so lucky, we are too late.  We'll just get the scraps."" Same for 2017. You wish you bought when it was cheap, but would you? Probably not. Why didn’t you buy more when it dropped to $4K last year? Would you have held if your money tripled or quadrupled?

Everyone has been telling me it is too late since 2013. 99% of my friends didn't buy at $200, or $2000, or $20,000 per BTC because it was ""too late"". Don't make the same mistake. It's not too late, Bitcoin isn't even a teenager yet, it's only 12 years old.

**Lesson 2:** Stop thinking about the 50 BTC you lost on satoshi dice (yeah, coins were cheap back then), or the 5 BTC for that bag of herb that you smoked (or that acid you took). It’s gone. Stop thinking you should have sold at $20K and bought back in at $3K instead of hodling all the way down and capitulating “to buy at $1.8K”. Stop thinking you can time the dips, and sell the tops. Stop regretting not buying earlier.

In short, stop fantasizing about what you could have done in the past and start thinking about today and the future. This is the mindset you should have:

*“What should I do today, so that tomorrow, I won’t regret yesterday?”*

""Buy Bitcoin"" is the right answer, by the way.

**Lesson 3:** Building things will require a lot of sacrifice. I would have way more BTC if I didn't start a Bitcoin startup in the Philippines back in 2014. 7 years in this industry feels like 70! I grew many white hairs in the last 7 years. I know many people who have the same experience -- those who would be wealthier and more relaxed today had they just bought Bitcoin and Hodled instead of building stuff. But at the end of the day, you can still accumulate AND build. Again, it is not too late, even at this stage. Stack sats while building stuff! And always remember that the backbone of this industry are the tens of thousands of people out there, building stuff to make Bitcoin WORK, to make Bitcoin accessible. This isn't some vaporware with no backing - it is backed by human ingenuity and the blood, sweat, and tears of all the startups and companies out there making sure this thing survives and thrives.

**Lesson 4:** Bitcoin will keep surprising us. Don’t believe people who tell you they know what will happen. When you think it is time to sell because you’ll be able to buy cheaper later, it will break out and up. When you think we will “never see X price again” we'll see it again. When people say this is is, this is the peak, it won't be the peak. Be prepared for faces to melt and minds to crumble into madness from disbelief at what Bitcoin will achieve. 

*There is no army in the world that can stop an idea whose time has come.*

**Lesson 5:** Bitcoin is a remarkable phenomenon, a once in a generation opportunity to participate in the evolution of how we move value around the world. Anyone that tells you otherwise is either ignorant or trying to deceive you. This network has gone through the most crucial tests of pressure and time that make it anti-fragile. Pressure and time, that’s really all it takes. Everything else will be built around this bedrock foundation.

**Lesson 6:** Mass adoption is a myth. Bitcoin doesn’t need ""mass adoption"". More like, mass adoption needs Bitcoin. It only needs a small % of the world’s wealth to “get there”. Bitcoin makes no promises other than to reliably and consistently create new publicly verifiable blocks of immutable transactions every ten minutes. This is all it needs to keep doing consistently and securely for its value to increase exponentially over time. Everything else is gravy.

**Lesson 7:** We still have at least another decade of this crazy rollercoaster ride before Bitcoin starts to get even slightly boring. Just strap in and enjoy it.

**Lesson 8:** Make some friends along the way. Make enemies if need be. I’ve made lifelong connections and relationships in the last 8 years in this industry. I have had a dedicated Buttcoiner hate group that created fake accounts similar to my name to try and embarrass me. Fake accounts, phishing, hacks, personal attacks. I don't give a fuck. And like I keep saying, we’ve only just begun.

A lot of the people you meet today will be playing huge roles in this industry in the near future. You’ll be in good company when the time comes. At the end of the day, life is all about the relationships you make along the way. Make sure they're meaningful ones.

Most of the friends I made since 2013 who have stuck around are already wealthy beyond their wildest dreams, and they're still sticking around, giving back, helping others, helping their communities, doing awesome shit.

**Lesson 9:** Do watch out for snakes and wolves disguised as people. Been scammed, lied to, stolen from, used, abused, harassed, you name it. There are a lot of bad actors out there, hiding behind smiling faces. They want what's yours and will go through great lengths to get it. Don't let anyone tell you different. These people will stab you in the back, slit your throat, take everything, and leave you out in the alley talking to yourself about what the fuck just happened. If you don't believe me, then you're the lamb that's going off to the slaughter.

**Lesson 10:** Take it easy. It’s easy to get caught up in all the hype, to want all that attention. It’s easy to get lost in the confidence of a bull market and the despair of a bear market. Step back and try to gain the peace of a lofty perspective. 

When you’ve been in the Bitcoin game for a while, you gain a certain peace. A relaxed comfort. Eyes open, ears open, radar up. Absorbing every message. Taking everything as it comes. Not mixing what they really are with what you want them to be. It's like an aerial view.

A view from above the myriad luck-dependent reactions of those who never gain such a peace. And when you gain that view, that peace - when you'd rather have the truth, no matter how disappointing, over a false hope, no matter how desirable - then you will finally understand the true meaning of hodling Bitcoin.

See you guys in another 8 years.

156,2021-04-28,"My Wife And I Have Become Bitcoin Laughstocks  Recently, my wife and I bought a chunk of Bitcoin after years of discussing it between ourselves. The other night we were in the HouseParty app with 3 other couples. Of those 6 people, 4 are firmly entrenched in the legacy banking system.

While we haven’t disclosed the amount we actually put into Bitcoin, we did acknowledge to them we decided to buy. Big mistake.

For the next hour we were subject to constant jokes. Wherever there was a jab to be made, it was quickly converted to a Bitcoin joke and directed our way. All 6 of them relished greatly in it. We are good sports and laughed along. 

At one point, I began to genuinely laugh with them. Not because the truth of their jokes were funny, but rather I was laughing at them as they laughed at us. 

Why?

Because Bitcoin is real.

They can laugh all they want. What’s more hilarious is how clueless they really are. I hope you’ll join me in laughing at those who laugh at us.

Let the haters hate and HODL on.

I don’t normally talk like this... but, HFSP.

Had to vent. 

Thanks for listening.

EDIT: Whoa. Have never had something blow up like this. Just wanted to vent as mentioned - didn’t realize it would connect like it did.

It sounds like most of us feel the same frustration. In that regard, I appreciate the kind notes and encouragement.

I do genuinely believe we are all on the right path and hope it works for us as intended.

157,2021-02-20,"I'm quitting smoking and buying Bitcoin every week with what I would've spent on cigarettes.I tried this a while ago, though I was throwing the money at options on robinhood, just to give myself something to do. Needless to say, it didn't work out. I blew a bunch of money and started smoking again just a few months later.

Now, though, I feel like it's different. I'm honestly looking for a way to give myself a comfortable future. I'm a felon bartender with a useless degree, and the pittance of a contribution to my 401k my paychecks provide is just mathematically insignificant. What's clear to me is that I'm perfectly happy literally burning my money, so I shouldn't have any trouble spending the same amount on something with real appreciating value -- *my future well-being*. And Bitcoin, of course.

Wish me luck.

Edit: Y'all are giving me way more inspiration and encouragement than I was expecting. Thank you sooooo much. Monday is my official quit date and I'll keep you posted.

Edit 2: based on a few people suggesting i buy *more* BTC *less often* -- due to fee structures I haven't figured out yet -- I'm going to do some research and come up with a more efficient method for buying than simply throwing money at BTC on Fridays, or whatever.

**How I send mistakenly 1 BTC to the Huobi Cold Wallet?**

A day I was watching a BTC rich list and exploring the addresses. I'm unsure how exactly it happens because I verified the address, but when I sent 1 BTC I did mistakenly to the wrong address!!! I verified that I was sending to the correct address, but I had to remake the sendship because the wallet crashed, probably there was the problem, the huobi's cold wallet address was in the clipboard. Anyways I don't have certainty how it happens.List:  [https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html](https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html)

It was a mistake, I work often sending and receiving BTC. When you do a certain task all the days copying wrong data could be a **TERRIBLE** but **EASY** mistake to do, because we are humans and we fall in the trust. **As you did a task correctly many many times you earn trust on yourself and try save time.** If it didn't happens to you ever you aren't being honest.

In both transaction, all inputs are addresses that BELONGS TO HUOBI, because you huobi are sending me BTC

Both transactions has 39 addresses as inputs in common (all huobi address, maybe deposit addresses of anothers huobi users)

Example: 1M9ndPSQ4fmMKaKW2oX7LtjduDqYUcFKCW

**7 months talking with Huobi Customer Support (part 2)**

After understanding this , they asked me my consent to pay a fee. I agreed. After they asked me sign a message with my privates keys. I did it. And finally they tell me ""Wait"". I'm waiting 7 months ago, all months I ask and they ever reply the same ""We will contact you"". Now they told me "" Hellosorry for the inconvenience, we feedback your problem to our technology department.  After a series of research and development, but it can not be solved.  Please understand this.  ""

I want to think that the team is failing and Huobi isn't wanting steal my BTC. What they are doing maybe could be illegal. I'm thinking to talk with lawers on Singapore, I don't know what more to do.

I tried to contact the CEO Livio on Twitter ( [https://twitter.com/livio\_huobi](https://twitter.com/livio_huobi) ) but they don't reply me! I want to think that someone else is administering their account.

The coronavirus shutdown is hammering supply and demand across the globe. That has forced the real economy into a sharp recession and triggered a rolling financial crisis. Below is a primer on one key piece of this mess: the crisis in corporate debt markets. This branch of finance is vitally important because even healthy companies often need access to credit. If they do not get it, they go under.

In 2008, the vector of crisis ran from mortgage-backed securities to the rest of the financial sector and then to the real economy. This time, the real economy is being hit directly, and the damage is reverberating back into financial markets.  The failing markets, in feedback-loop fashion, further threaten the real economy as corporations find it harder to borrow. As the corporate debt markets sour, major companies will go bankrupt. Unemployment is skyrocketing. Some analysts expect the economy to contract by an annualized rate of 30 percent during the second quarter of 2020.

Already, US financial markets are on public life support. The Federal Reserve has committed to unlimited purchases of all sorts of assets: US Treasuries, mortgage-backed securities, car loans, municipal debts, and, in a historic step, both short term and long-term corporate debt. But the crisis will require more than a financial rescue.

The key political question now is: What sort of controls will come with the state intervention? Corporate greed and self-dealing need to be checked not merely in the name of fairness but also to make sure public bailout money is actually invested in the real economy rather than just gambled away, as it was after the 2008 crash and rescue.

###The Rise of Corporate Debt

Since 2008, household debt levels have actually declined and are now lower than they were going into the last crash. But not corporate debt. Measured as a firm’s “net debt” compared to its EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization), corporate debt has doubled since the last crash. In 2009, the average American company owed $2 of debt for every $1 in earnings. Today, the average firm carries net debt to EBITDA of 3 to 1, and many firms — like Ford Motor, CarMax, Harley-Davidson, and General Motors — carry ratios ranging from 8 to 1, to as high as 15 to 1. Boeing, a special case because of its 737 MAX crisis, carries a ratio of 37 to 1.

Over the last two decades, corporate America’s credit rating has collapsed. In the early ’90s, more than sixty companies held AAA credit ratings. Today, only two US firms are AAA rated: Johnson & Johnson and Microsoft. In 2001, fewer than one in five “investment-grade” firms were rated BBB. Today half of all investment-grade corporate debt belongs to firms rated “triple-B” (BBB) or lower. A third of those firms are rated triple-B minus (BBB-), one notch away from speculative or “junk” status.

Already many triple-B-rated corporate bonds are trading on secondary markets at unusually low prices and high yields, often above 5 percent; that means even “investment grade” bonds are being treated as junk. Soon many triple-B-rated corporations will be formally downgraded to junk. That will drive up their borrowing costs and restrict their access to credit. Even healthy companies often need access to ready credit. If they do not get it, they go under.

The rating agency Moody’s estimates the default rate for “speculative-grade” debt — companies with ratings lower than Baa from Moody’s Investors Service, or a rating lower than BBB from Standard & Poor’s — might reach 10 percent this year, up from 2.3 percent last year. The consequences of all this will reverberate throughout the wider economy, deepening and extending the recession.

Total global corporate debt, including bonds and loans, is approximately $66 trillion; more than double what it was a decade ago. For comparison, the combined gross national product of all economies was estimated at $80.27 trillion in 2017. About a quarter of that is the US economy.

###What They Did With the Money

After the 2008 crash, the world’s central banks, with the US Federal Reserve in the lead, spent the next decade pushing money into the financial markets by way of super-low interest rates and the direct public purchase of financial assets from the private sector via quantitative easing (QE).

The cheap credit encouraged lots of corporate borrowing in the form of loans from banks and massive issuance of corporate bonds. Unlike loans, which can be routinely extended, or sometimes abruptly terminated, or have interest rates that float up and down, corporate bonds are debt instruments issued by a company committing to repay borrowed money on a specified schedule at a specified, usually fixed, rate of interest.

Corporations have been borrowing for a variety of reasons that range from shrewd arbitrage to stupid and reckless asset stripping. For a struggling and unprofitable company, for example JCPenney, debt can be a lifeline. For a profitable firm, borrowing money can be a way to raise capital without diluting existing shareholders’ claim on the company’s profits, which would happen if the firm issued stock.

Even some profitable firms with piles of cash borrowed rather than spend their cash, in part for the firepower effect: letting other competitors and market entrants know that the firm has enough money on hand to buy out any threatening start-ups, and showing the world the firm is ready to ride out any economic crisis.

Some firms used their borrowed money to buy other firms. This helped fuel a post-2008 wave of mergers and acquisitions (M&As). Deloitte reported “more than $10 trillion in [M&A] domestic transactions since 2013.” Targeted companies borrowed to stockpile cash as a defense against such takeovers.

Firms also borrowed to fund CEO compensation, distributions to investors via dividends, and stock buybacks. Companies buy back their own stock so as to boost its price. A rising stock price is useful in many ways: it can keep away hostile raiders by making a targeted company too expensive to take over, but it can also draw in friendly suitors because (with some creative accounting) a rising stock value can make a weak firm appear more profitable. Corporate executives like a rising stock price because compensation packages are both tied to stock performance and almost always include some payment in company stock, so the higher the stock price, the higher the executives’ payout.

Sometimes, firms even invested their borrowed money in actual production. The capital-intensive oil and gas industry did that, but as we explain below, it still faces a crisis, perhaps more salient than other sectors.

###Bad Credit as Perverse Incentive

The end result of all the borrowing was declining corporate credit-worthiness: corporate debt soon badly outpaced their earnings growth and cash balances. This led to widespread credit-rating downgrades.

Perversely, lower credit ratings did not slow the borrowing binge, but rather spurred on further lending and borrowing, because as corporate credit ratings slipped, the interest rate that the downgraded firms had to pay on their loans and bonds increased. And, thus, so too did the lenders’ profits.

Corporate debt and stock prices entered into a twisted dialectic, each driving the other. As the stock market continued to inflate over the last decade, it provided the confidence investors required to continue their purchases of risky corporate bonds.

Keep in mind that many of the lending banks and asset funds were actually or essentially borrowing from Uncle Sam at inflation-adjusted rates close to zero, then lending to companies with triple-B and triple-B minus ratings at 5 percent interest. Profits like that meant there were always banks and asset funds eager to lend to debt-burdened corporations.

Investors could directly purchase specific corporations’ bonds, or, as is more often the case, invest in mutual funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that target an array of corporate bonds. High-risk loans were also sliced and diced and repackaged into bundles called “collateralized loan obligations” (CLOs), a class of securities backed by an underlying portfolio of corporate loans.

According to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, the majority of American CLOs are held by US institutional investors, including insurance companies, mutual funds, and depository institutions. This means that when the debt is unable to be serviced, the pain will be absorbed within the US economy, much of it by the unassuming customers of these financial behemoths.

As was the case with the mortgage-backed securities of the 2008 crash, these funds helped “distribute risk” and thus gave an appearance of safety. The logic was that owning 1 percent of a hundred different loans would be safer, even if some loans went bad, than owning the entirety of a single debt security. The logic is not entirely wrong. And that is part of the problem: it encouraged yet more lending. As long as the economic forecast was optimistic, there was no reason for the debt spree to let up.

###Zombies and Others

Corporate debt, like much of the economy, is a story of disparities. Not every corporation is burdened by debt. Some firms are actually awash in cash. Microsoft, Berkshire Hathaway, Alphabet Inc, and Apple each sit on more than $100 billion in cash. As a whole, corporate America has been sitting on record amounts of cash in recent years. But at the same time, Morgan Stanley Investment Management estimates that one in six US companies cannot cover even the interest payments on their debts.

At the heart of the problem are “leveraged loans” and so-called zombie firms. Leveraged loans are a type of expensive, high-risk credit extended to already heavily indebted companies. Since the 2008 crash, the leveraged loan market has doubled to $1.2 trillion. Now, leveraged loans in the United States are being re-sold at only 84 cents on the dollar, their lowest price since August 2009. The majority of leveraged loans — more than half — are in the form of the aforementioned CLOs. In the fourth quarter of 2018, there were $617 billion of CLOs outstanding.

Zombie firms are defined by the Bank for International Settlements as heavily indebted, well-established companies that have failed to be profitable over an extended period and have low expected profitability in the future. In other words, heavily indebted start-ups do not qualify as zombies. The most threatened sectors are energy, automotive, insurance, capital goods (meaning equipment and machinery), telecoms, aerospace and defense, and some parts of retail.

The bull market of rising, often overvalued, stock prices allowed many uncompetitive and unprofitable companies to appear healthy based solely on their stock’s performance. Even before the markets started to crash on March 9, some analysts were prescient enough to call the market’s bluff at the beginning of the year.

But in this rapidly developing crisis, firms all across the economy may soon find it impossible to meet their liabilities. With the coronavirus breaking supply chains and forcing massive constrictions in consumer demand, corporate earnings are contracting fast, which in turn will badly hurt corporate debt servicing.

Like a hypertrophied organ rupturing, the putrefaction of unsustainable corporate debt now threatens to create a generalized economic sepsis that will hurt even healthy firms.

###Profiles in Debt

Airlines. The top six major US airlines spent enormous sums to buy back their stock over the last decade. US airlines (as a whole) spent 96 percent of their borrowed money on buying back stock. Now, revenue from flights is plummeting. United Airlines’ bookings have fallen by 70 percent. Back in 2011, American Airlines filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy with $29 billion in liabilities; today, they have over $34 billion in debt. Yields on some of their bonds reached a whopping 12 percent, a particularly distressing sign as interest rates have been slashed by the Fed in an effort to relieve credit markets.

Energy. Even before the effects of coronavirus eviscerated demand for fossil fuels, US energy companies were suffering due to high fixed costs and low energy prices. In the last five years, 208 US energy companies have declared bankruptcy. Energy prices have been pushed down by the fracking revolution, the rise of renewable energy, and oil overproduction due to struggles between large producers like Saudi Arabia, Russia, and the United States.

Now the coronavirus shock is pushing firms over the edge. Occidental Petroleum — which has $40 billion in debt, while its market value (the value of all of its stocks combined) is less than $11 billion — recently had its debt downgraded to junk.

Energy mutual funds reveal the crisis in the energy sector as a whole. Vanguard Energy Fund, considered one of the top four oil mutual funds, has lost over 41 percent of its value since the beginning of the year. Of course, the biggest oil companies, the “Oil Majors” (such as BP, Exxon Mobil, and Royal Dutch Shell) have enough resources, market power, and government support to survive the crisis. But the effects on the less established firms stretch beyond the energy industry itself.

Lenders. As the oil and gas firms go into crisis, the banks that extended them credit may also face defaults. Loans outstanding to the petroleum sector from regional banks in North America exceed $100 billion. Banks financing oil companies in Texas and Oklahoma saw their share prices drop nearly 30 percent. In oil-dependent states, public budgets will hurt as tax revenues decline sharply.

Retail. A number of important retailers carry net debt to EBITDA ratios that are too high to be sustainable under current conditions. For example, Rite Aid owes $15.80 for every dollar it earns. For JCPenney, the ratio is $8.30 to $1; for Walgreens Boots Alliance, it is $5.80 to $1. Office Depot owes $4.60 compared to every dollar earned.

###Beyond Bailout

Bailing out distressed companies, even taking them under public ownership for a while, may staunch the bleeding. And the bubble can eventually be reinflated with enough effort. But a replay of the 2008 bailout, which involved lots of public money but very little public regulation and planning, will only mean a long slump followed by a bubble for the rich.

The American economy is a sick beast. It needs not only government handouts and ownership — which it is getting — it also needs planning.

Oil, airlines, and cruise ships — these are high-emission industries that, in the face of climate crisis, must be radically transformed or cease to exist. With government ownership and planning, these industries could be unwound and their resources redeployed.

Although COVID-19 set off our current recession, it was the indulgence of the 1 percent built into the 2008 rescue that is responsible for the depth and severity of our current economic crisis. Without guidance, money was poured into the financial system. Not surprisingly, it blossomed alongside the mutually reinforcing dynamic of artificially inflated stock prices and ballooning corporate debt.

Capitulation to the gluttony of financiers is deeply unjust. But it is also unworkable in purely technical terms. Without constraints on greed, there will be another bubble and crash and a longer slump, more suffering, greater inequality, and more social instability. We have to force government to use its legal and financial power to steer the American economy toward more egalitarian, socially rational, and environmentally sustainable purposes. We have to make this bailout work for the majority of us.

#Corporate Socialism: The Government is Bailing Out Investors & Managers Not You


The U.S. government is enacting measures to save the airlines, Boeing, and similarly affected corporations. While we clearly insist that these companies must be saved, there may be ethical, economic, and structural problems associated with the details of the execution. As a matter of fact, if you study the history of bailouts, there will be.



The bailouts of 2008–9 saved the banks (but mostly the bankers), thanks to the execution by then-treasury secretary Timothy Geithner who fought for bank executives against both Congress and some other members of the Obama administration. Bankers who lost more money than ever earned in the history of banking, received the largest bonus pool in the history of banking less than two years later, in 2010. And, suspiciously, only a few years later, Geithner received a highly paid position in the finance industry.

That was a blatant case of corporate socialism and a reward to an industry whose managers are stopped out by the taxpayer. The asymmetry (moral hazard) and what we call optionality for the bankers can be expressed as follows: heads and the bankers win, tails and the taxpayer loses. Furthermore, this does not count the policy of quantitative easing that went to inflate asset values and increased inequality by benefiting the super rich. Remember that bailouts come with printed money, which effectively deflate the wages of the middle class in relation to asset values such as 
ultra-luxury apartments in New York City.

The Generalized Bob Rubin Trade: Keep the profits, transfer losses to taxpayers. Named after Bob Rubin who pocketed 120 million dollars from Citi but claimed uncertainty and kept past bonuses. This encourages anyone to never be insured for such eventualities since the government will pick up the tab.

####If It’s Bailed Out, It’s a Utility

First, we must not conflate airlines as a physical company with the financial structure involved. Nor should we conflate the fate of the employees of the airlines with the unemployment of our fellow citizens, which can be directly compensated rather than indirectly via leftovers of corporate subsidies. We should learn from the Geithner episode that bailing out individuals based on their needs is not the same as bailing out corporations based on our need for them.

Saving an airline, therefore, should not equate to subsidizing their shareholders and highly compensated managers and promote additional moral hazard in society. For the very fact that we are saving airlines indicates their role as utility. And if as such they are necessary for society, then why do their managers have optionality? Are civil servants on a bonus scheme? The same argument must also be made, by extension, against indirectly bailing out the pools of capital, like hedge funds and endless investment strategies, that are so exposed to these assets; they have no honest risk mitigation strategy, other than a trained naïve reliance on bailouts or what’s called in the industry the “government put”.

Second, these corporations are lobbying for bailouts, which they will eventually get thanks to the pressure they can exert on the government via lobby units. But how about the small corner restaurant ? The independent tour guide ? The personal trainer? The massage professional? The barber? The hotdog vendor living from tourists near the Met Museum ? These groups cannot afford lobbyists and will be ignored.

####Buffers Not Debt

Third, as we have been warning since 2006, companies need buffers to face uncertainty –not debt (an inverse buffer), but buffers. Mother nature gave us two kidneys when we only need about a portion of a single one. Why? Because of contingency. We do not need to predict specific adverse events to know that a buffer is a must. Which brings us to the buyback problem. Why should we spend taxpayer money to bailout companies who spent their cash (and often even borrowed to generate that cash) to buy their own stock (so the CEO gets optionality), instead of building a rainy day buffer? Such bailouts punish those who acted conservatively and harms them in the long run, favoring the fool and the rent-seeker.

####Not a Black Swan

Furthermore, some people claim that the pandemic is a “Black Swan”, hence something unexpected so not planning for it is excusable. The book they commonly cite is The Black Swan. Had they read that book, they would have known that such a global pandemic is explicitly presented there as a white swan: something that would eventually take place with great certainty. Such acute pandemic is unavoidable, the result of the structure of the modern world; and its economic consequences would be compounded because of the increased connectivity and overoptimization. As a matter of fact, the government of Singapore, whom we advised in the past, was prepared for such an eventuality with a precise plan since as early as 2010.

246,2021-06-06,"There are potentially huge US tax and reporting implications if El Salvador makes Bitcoin legal tenderOn its face, it’s obviously great for Bitcoin if El Salvador adopts it as its legal tender. There are, however, nuances in the internal revenue code that make this news much bigger than most realize.

Most know that when trading foreign currencies gains must be reported and are taxed.  But Section 988(e) carves out a *de minimis* exception for “personal transactions” where the gains do not exceed $200.

This is intended to allow travelers to transact in foreign currencies without all of the burdensome reporting requirements.

So far, Bitcoin has not qualified for this exception.  Under IRS Notice 2014-21, the IRS opines that Bitcoin is “property” and not a “currency” because “**it does not have legal tender status in any jurisdiction**.”  There is a good argument, though, that once Bitcoin is “legal tender” in El Salvador, it will qualify for US individuals as a “nonfunctional currency” (under Section 988), allowing individuals to forgo reporting gains on small, daily transactions—“personal transactions.”

In other words (**tldr**), if Bitcoin is legal tender in El Salvador, US citizens could possibly freely transact in Bitcoin, as a “nonfunctional currency,” without a need to report gains of less than $200.

That’s potentially huge news for retail US citizens, but **there is also huge news for US Bitcoin businesses.**

Most US businesses use the US dollar as their unit of account for bookkeeping and reporting.  However, there are cases where businesses operating primarily in foreign jurisdictions use a foreign currency—the unit of account does not have to be USD.  The unit of account used by the business is the “**functional currency**” of the business and, perhaps, even an individual (see Sec. 985 IRC).  If a business’s “functional currency” is a foreign currency, it does not have to bother with gains/losses related to USD fluctuations.

Again, under Notice 2014-21, Bitcoin cannot qualify as a functional currency.  And, again, this could change if El Salvador adopts Bitcoin as legal tender.

**Final tldr** If Bitcoin becomes legal tender in El Salvador, IRS Notice 2014-21 may become partially null, relieving US individuals and business of huge tax and reporting burdens, paving the way for Bitcoin to legally and easily be used as a currency in the US.

*Disclaimer: I am not a tax lawyer.  The discussion and analysis on this should be much more detailed before financial decisions are made.  I’ve written this to be used as a starting point for discussion with a tax lawyer.*

**Edit**: Many have pointed out that Japan recognized Bitcoin as “legal tender” in 2017.  They did not.  A lot of misinformed authors incorrectly wrote that, but there is a distinction between Japan’s legal recognition of Bitcoin as a form of payment and what the Code/Regs/precedent considers “legal tender.”  I think (and hope) that El Salvador will truly recognize Bitcoin as legal tender.

**Edit 2**:  A Decrypt article mentioning this thread and citing former IRS counsel to point out additional nuances.  https://decrypt.co/73101/el-salvador-legal-tender-move-unlikely-to-change-us-tax-on-bitcoin-former-irs-counsel.  FWIW, I agree with most of what’s written.  Particularly, (1) if Bitcoin is currency, all gains over $200 would be treated as ordinary income rather than capital gains and (2) the IRS will likely need to be challenged before their is clarity on whether Bitcoin will qualify as a currency rather than “property.”  I disagree that it will require “more and more” countries to recognize it as legal tender—one should be fine, but it is true that there will likely need to be evidence that Bitcoin is actually commonly used for personal transactions (not just a pretextual “legal tender”).  With the lightning network quickly gaining momentum, I expect El Salvador’s move to be the catalyst that starts to convert Bitcoin’s usage from just a store of value to also a common medium of exchange (i.e., a currency).",positive,0.92105085,4656

Terabytes of data, 12.9 million documents, all detailing how billionaires and over 300 corrupt politicians have avoided taxes, and Bitcoin was not used a single time by them.

How can it be that exactly the politicians who claim that crypto would be the main accelerator of financial crime and tax evasion have used exclusively the broken old financial system to do that which they blame crypto on supporting.

With Bitcoin every single transaction would be transparent on the blockchain, everyone could see where all the money is going. Wondering why they are so against it? The reason seems more obvious than ever.

Pandora papers showed that people are using loopholes in tax laws to hide their wealth in tax havens to hide their wealth or ill gotten gains. They are not using cryptocurrency to do that, there are plenty of loopholes in tax laws for doing it legally.

The rich are holding properties and investments under a network of offshore companies that are set up in other countries, or ""offshore"".

These offshore countries or territories are where:

\- it's easy to set up companies

\- there are laws that make it difficult to identify owners of companies

\- there is low or no corporation tax.

The best part of it is that using tax havens to dodge taxes is not illegal. Loopholes in the law allow people to legally avoid paying some taxes by  moving their money or setting up companies in tax havens, but it is  often seen as unethical.

Its estimated that from $5.6 trillion to $32 trillion is hidden in tax havens, according to the ICIJ.  The IMF has said the use of tax havens costs governments worldwide up to $600bn in lost taxes each year.

To hide money all you need to do set up a shell company in one of the countries or  jurisdictions with high levels of secrecy. This is a company that exists  in name only, with no staff or office.  It costs money though. Specialist firms are paid to set up and run shell  companies on your behalf. These firms can provide an address and names  of paid directors, therefore leaving no trail of who is ultimately  behind the business.

When such a huge amount of money is hidden in offshore havens, the rich still blames cryptocurrency as the culprit for money laundering. This is classic gaslighting. They are projecting and blaming the most vulnerable group, what they do themselves.

This legal way of tax dodging will never end because the people that could end the secrecy offshore are themselves benefiting from it. So there's no incentive for them to end it.

Its time more people speak up against this and move more towards cryptocurrency where all data is independently verifiable.",positive,0.8045052,4593

253,2021-05-13,"This is a very important message about bitcoin. Please take the time to read it.I mainly created this thread because of so many users coming here and saying bitcoin is old and outdated. These users are very misinformed. They've been fed misinformation by people that are profiting from spreading misinformation.

**Just read the bold text if this thread is too long for you.** The bold text is the summarized version and it contains all of most important information within this long wall of this text. I did this for users who don't like to read long posts. I know it's still long.

**If you'r a bitcoin veteran and you already know a lot about bitcoin:** Skip straight to the two bold paragraphs second from the bottom. They contain information about most of bitcoin's recent developments and second layer protocols.

**Bitcoin is just a protocol. It was released in 2009**

**TCP/IP are just protocols that were released in 1972. You could call them the backbone of the internet. Look at how long it took us to get to the internet that we have today, where TCP/IP is the backbone.**

[**Click here to read a bit about TCP/IP and blockchain technology.**](https://hbr.org/2017/01/the-truth-about-blockchain)

HTTP is just a protocol that was released in 1991. You could call it the backbone of the world wide web.

SMTP is just a protocol that was released in 1982. And IMAP is just a protocol that was released in 1986. You could call these protocols the backbone of email. Many people used to say that email was useless and nobody would ever use it.

TCP/IP was actually developed by cypherpunks just like bitcoin, PGP, and many other great protocols and technologies. In fact, two cypherpunks by the names of Hal and Len actually lived near each other and both helped develop TCP/IP. And they are also two of the three most likely candidates for being Satoshi. But that's not important.

People used to say computers and the internet was a useless waste too. Computers do use far more electricity than bitcoin mining. So perhaps they were right after all.

We are in the early majority. Bitcoin hasn't had it's Windows 95 moment yet, and I'll explain that statement below.

**Do you remember back in 1990 when everyone had heard of the internet but you didn't know anyone who used it? This is much like bitcoin right now, and even less people use the lightning network. Both are still in beta. February 1991 is when AOL for DOS was released. AOL for DOS made the internet fairly easy for everyone to use. But you still probably didn't know anyone who used it, and you probably didn't use it yourself. The internet didn't start getting popular until Windows 95 came out and most people still didn't use it for more years.**

**I can't wait to see where bitcoin is in a 12 years where it will be 23 years old. It was 1995 back when TCP/IP was 23 years old.** 

[**Click here to watch/listen to some news clips talking about the internet and email back in 1995 when TCP/IP was 23 years old.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95-yZ-31j9A) This was also the same year that Windows 95 was released.

**Bitcoin has the potential to be the backbone of the financial system.** And that's what people like the rocket scientist Michael Saylor are betting on. Michael Saylor is the same MIT graduate that predicted the mobile wave.

I want to inform you all that **I am not a bitcoin maximalist.** And my favorite cryptocurrency is actually an altcoin. I know you're shocked to hear that. But bitcoin holders please fear not, because **I still see bitcoin as the safest bet. And I also see bitcoin as the only protocol that has the potential to be the backbone of the financial system.** If this happened, then companies and countries would be using on-chain payments to settle large payments. There could be bitcoin backed currencies (like gold backed currencies of the past) and even bitcoin banks. **Hal Finney predicted there would be bitcoin banks in the future all the way back in 2010** Most people would be using second layer payment protocols to send bitcoin in milliseconds and costing almost no fees. And these **second layer protocols like the lightning network take a negligible amount of electricity to operate. Bitcoin can scale to handle as much demand as the world can create because of it's second layer protocols.**

Satoshi didn't create bitcoin to get rich. **He created bitcoin to allow online payments to be sent directly from one person to another without requiring trust or permission of anyone else.** Over 99% of altcoins were created to enrich their founders and over 99% of them have no future. None of them are as secure, as decentralized, or launched as fairly as bitcoin. **Bitcoin has the most users, largest infrastructure, no premine, no developer fund/tax, no leader, longest track record, is the most secure, is the most decentralized, and bitcoins circulated freely for 18 months before ever having any monetary value which can never even be replicated by an altcoin because the genie is out of the bottle now.** And unlike the founders of every altcoin, Satoshi never cashed out. The issuance schedule and maximum supply of bitcoin are both clearly defined and will never change. Bitcoin development is decentralized and anyone can contribute because Satoshi published bitcoin under the MIT license so that it's open source and anyone is free to do anything with the source code. Bitcoin protocol rule changes are also decentralized because they require nodes to come to consensus.** All of this is why bitcoin is so vastly different than altcoins.

Cryptocurrency is full of scammers/grifters, ignorance, and people that actually believe the lies because they've been sucked into altcoin cults. Gamblers use altcoins for trading/gambling to increase their bitcoin stack [or even their ETH stack if they don't understand bitcoin and cryptocurrency,](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T89gsJ2MsG8&t=47m24s) and they aren't aware that Gary Gensler, the current Chair of the SEC, just said that ""a lot of crypto tokens, I won't call them cryptocurrencies for this moment, are indeed non-compliant securities"" this week. And nobody told them that the SEC disregarded previous claims made by Bill Hinman, former director of the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance, who suggested that offers and sales of ETH are not securities transactions. But enough about that.

Gambling on altcoins can be very profitable during a bull run because the altcoin market is basically a short term casino where you actually have a good chance of winning. It's a relatively easy way to increase your bitcoin stack. 

**If you properly handle your private keys, then your bitcoin can't be stolen or seized and nobody can stop you from sending it to anyone else.** 

**Any protocol rule change that doesn't make any previously invalid blocks now valid is called a soft fork.** This would be a miner upgrade and is easier to accomplish, we can give the mining nodes a chance to upgrade, bip9 can be used, or the nodes can just run compatible software.

**All protocol rule changes must be agreed upon by fully validating bitcoin nodes.** Even if the mining nodes don't agree, if the full nodes come to consensus and make a rule change, people will continue to mine as long as it's profitable to mine, so the miners have to deal with it or piss off and other people will mine. The mining difficulty will adjust every 2016 blocks regardless. So when it comes down to it, only the users who run fully validating bitcoin nodes are in charge of bitcoin. 

**Fully validating bitcoin nodes must come to consensus on any rule change that makes any previously invalid blocks now valid, and that's called a hard fork.** This would be a pretty big upgrade, and it would be difficult to pull off with bitcoin because it's decentralized. And that's a good thing.

**There is a maximum supply of 21 million bitcoin**, and that will never change. Satoshi designed the protocol so that **miners solve a block every 10 minutes on average**. The block reward started at 50 BTC. **The block reward gets divided by 2 every 210,000 blocks** (4 years if the hashrate remained constant), which we call the block reward halving. The block reward is currently 6.25 bitcoin and the next block reward halving will happen around April 2024. And then the block reward will be 3.125 bitcoin. **The mining difficulty adjustments every 2016 blocks** which is approximately 2 weeks. So if it's profitable for people to mine, then hardware gets turned on and the mining difficulty increases. But if the price of bitcoin lowers so that some hardware is unprofitable to run, then it gets turned off and the mining difficulty decreases. And as the block reward gets divided by 2 every 210 thousand blocks, the **transaction fees will continue to incentivize miners to secure the network even when the block reward is minuscule.**

Many users here like to repeat that the last bitcoin wont be mined until 2140. And while it is true that the last satoshi will not be mined until 2140. It is also true that **approximately 97% of bitcoins will be mined by 2032**, and the block reward will just be 0.78125 BTC at that time. But if bitcoin is worth, for example, a million dollars, then the block reward alone in 2032 would be worth more than the current block reward + transaction fees at this time. That's not even accounting for all of the transaction fees that the miners will also be collecting from the transactions that they include in blocks. 

Bitcoin is constantly being developed.  **Bitcoin also has second layer protocols that are constantly being developed and they don't require any consensus.** So anyone can just create second layer protocols for bitcoin and nobody needs to agree on anything. It's up to the users of bitcoin if they want to use various second layer protocols that maximize the user experience. **One of bitcoin's second layer payment protocols is called the lightning network. It's still in beta but it already allows an unlimited amount of users to send and receive bitcoin transactions in milliseconds for extremely minuscule fees.** 

[**Bitfinex**](https://www.bitfinex.com/), [**Okcoin**](https://www.okcoin.com/), and [**Strike by Zap**](https://beta.strike.me/faq) have already integrated the lightning network so that people can deposit and withdraw bitcoin using it and [**Kraken**](https://www.kraken.com/) **will be integrating the lightning network later this year.** Kraken even has a US banking charter and [**Kraken Bank**](https://www.kraken.com/en-us/bank) plans to offer most typical banking services later this year.

**For newbies wanting to try out the lightning network:** I only recommend you to use [**Muun**](https://muun.com/) wallet or [**Phoenix**](https://phoenix.acinq.co/) wallet. They're both user friendly and they allow users to send and receive on-chain transactions or lightning transactions, all from the same wallet. [**BlueWallet**](https://bluewallet.io/) is also a great choice but it's more advanced than Muun and Phoenix.

**For US residents only:** Consider trying out [**Strike**](https://beta.strike.me/faq) by Zap. It has no fees and it allows Americans to use cash in their bank account to buy bitcoin and have it be sent anywhere in milliseconds using the lightning network. Or they can send a lightning payment and receive cash in their bank. So Americans can use Strike app to fund lightning integrated exchanges with bitcoin instantly, to fund their lightning channels with satoshis, or to make instant bitcoin lightning payments, and all without any fees. I believe that Strike is also capable of sending and receiving on-chain bitcoin payments

**Bitcoin has second layer protocols like the lightning network and statechains. The lightning network allows an unlimited amount of users to sent and receive bitcoin in milliseconds for almost no fees, and uses minuscule electricity. Bitcoin also has a second layer protocol called statechains that allow non-custodial off chain transfers which bypass paying transaction fees and waiting for confirmations. And statechains can also be turned directly into lightning channels at will. So statechains allow users to open and close lightning channels without performing any on-chain transactions, without paying a transaction fee, and without waiting for a confirmation.**

**Bitcoin is also switching to schnorr signatures and activating taproot this year which will improve privacy, security, and efficiency. This will also lower the operating costs of running a node and the transaction fees for exchanges by an expected 30% and it will also allow us to use many more second layer protocols that have been developed. This will also allow us to create massive multi-signature transactions that are substantially smaller in size, and will even allow users to aggregate all the multiple signatures of a transaction into one (multiple signers can produce a joint public key and then jointly sign with a single signature). Shnorr signatures and taproot will also allow us to use the coinswap protocol which is pretty self explanatory, the musig2 protocol which will allow aggregating public keys and signatures, new discreet log contracts which increases privacy and scalability minimizes the trust required in the oracle which provides external data for the contract, and point time locked contracts which will improve the privacy of bitcoin payments using the lightning network. Trustless cross chain atomic swaps should also be available towards the end of this year. Schnorr signatures also makes multi-signature and single-signature transactions indistinguishable on the blockchain so an observer will not even be able to tell if a multi-signature transaction or a trustless cross chain atomic swap has happened by viewing the blockchain. NFTs can also be done on bitcoin and that's where they were done first back in 2012. There's also various sidechains in development, including liquid network. There's the RGB protocol which will allow smart contracts to be done using bitcoin on the lightning network. And much more.**

**Money (not fiat currency) always evolves in four stages** (this is from the *what is money?* section of *The Nature and Creation of Money* chapter of a college course on *Principles of Macroeconomics*). **Bitcoin is currently going through the second stage of the evolution of money, which is a store of value.** The next stage is a widely used medium of exchange. Bitcoin may evolve into the third stage in 5 years, in 7 years, in 12 years, or **bitcoin may never evolve passed the second stage**. The final stage of the evolution of money is a unit of account. Bitcoin is also currently going through price discovery. **Bitcoin's true value needs to be found before it will ever be a widely used medium of exchange The lightning network also to be adopted by the users, merchants, and exchanges before it's even possible for bitcoin to evolve into a widely used medium of exchange.**",positive,0.88974196,4580

For new bitcoiners & pre-coiners:

Don't feel bad for not understanding bitcoin immediately, it takes a long time. 

You're not late. Everyone including myself felt late. It is still e-a-r-l-y.

HINDSIGHT IS 20/20. The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now. Seize the day and it's time to go all in. This asset is now de-risked and a 10000000 times better buy now than back in 2011 from a risk adjusted perspective.

I've watched this god damn internet project grow from literally being mocked 24/7 including by holders and now it's being adopted as a treasury reserve asset by Publicly listed companies. It has already won. The risk is gone.

Buy bitcoin now and front-run every public and privately listed corporation, and every nation states that wants to stay relevant in the 21st century too.

The educational material is awesome nowadays. I have been studying bitcoin 5+ hours a day for the past 2.5 years and every week I learn something new about bitcoin and how money works and realise how ignorant I was before.

First buy Bitcoin. Second invest in yourself through education. Investing in educating yourself will quell any anxiety around holding such a large % of capital in Bitcoin.

HODL does not stand for ""hold on for dear life"". That's dumb.

HODL is from a drunk misspelling from a post on the bitcoin talk forum about the price crashing and a dude's girlfriend out at a lesbian bar.

Open to answering questions.

Peace.

Yeah, that was less than a week ago. Everyone needs to chill. Good things take time. Panic selling is the quickest way to lose all your money. Hold, accumulate and be patient. Yes this is Financial advice.

Let bitcoin build a base floor and consolidate, it will only give it more power when taking off next spike up. Every market has good and bad weeks, it does not mean it won’t reach a new all-time high tomorrow, next week or next month.

For all the newbs out there, if you can’t handle seeing your portfolio drop 50% to 80% in hours, you should rethink your investments before you lose all your hair. This is what crypto does, and it goes both ways. 

I’ve been through multiple cycles and if there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that every time there’s a nice decline in price, the media/ retail investors think the world is coming to an end, only to contradict themselves the second it goes back up.

Market manipulation is a real thing. Not everything you hear or read in articles is true.

This is a red alert. A provision that’s so [poorly](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20210802/17045447294/bidens-infrastructure-bill-shouldnt-undermine-cryptocurrency-infrastructure-process.shtml) written it could crush the cryptocurrency ecosystem and dramatically expand US government [surveillance](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/cryptocurrency-surveillance-provision-buried-infrastructure-bill-disaster-digital) has been added to the must-pass bipartisan infrastructure package at the last minute. Fortunately, Senators Wyden, Toomey, and Lummis have introduced an amendment that would fix the language and clarify that the expansion of the definition of a “broker” doesn’t apply to open source software developers or validators like miners or stakers. 

**Call your Senators right now at 517-200-9518. We'll connect you to their offices and guide you through the process.**

**When a staff member answers, tell them:**

**“Hi, I’m calling to ask that you support Senator Wyden, Toomey, and Lummis's amendment to the cryptocurrency provision of the infrastructure bill (H.R. 3684) . This amendment will ensure that the provision does not dramatically expand financial surveillance, harm innovation, or undermine human rights. Policies that impact basic freedom and the future of the Internet should be debated carefully and should never be attached to must-pass bills. Thank you.”**",positive,0.88643336,4233

332,2021-09-19,"New Shocking US Crypto Regulation Far More Invasive [Due Diligence]# New US Crypto Regulation Far More Invasive Than We Thought

**US Congress intends to regulate crypto on a level far deeper  than currently understood―They will:**

&#x200B;

* Designate Bitcoin, Ether, and their hard-forks as commodities and regulate their transactions accordingly;
* Create legal uncertainty for all other crypto projects and ICOs by allowing them to be labeled as securities;
* Ban the use of (unauthorized) stablecoins;
* Introduce penalties for the use of mixers and privacy coins;
* Rebrand smart-contracts that take longer than 24 hours to deliver as futures contracts and regulate them accordingly;
* Re-define legal tender and change the way money is created by the Federal Reserve; and authorize the issuing of a digital USD of which all transactions are recorded;
* Introduce foreign regulations into US law for all virtual asset service providers in the US (and with US clients). This would not be done to then never use it.

&#x200B;

**In short: Congress wants to bring crypto-currencies under full oversight and control.**

These new regulations introduce massive regulatory burdens on existing projects, ban and criminalize current normal activities, restrain innovation and free enterprise, and even introduce a transparent central bank digital digital currency that redefines money as we know it!

According to United States representative Don Beyer, congress should incorporate “digital assets into existing financial regulatory structures.”(1) As you will see, they intend to do just that.

And it will change the way things are done for crypto forever…

&#x200B;

## <What This Post Is About_

This post provides an overview of the crypto legislation currently (September 2021) being put through US congress.

It does not just look at the proposed bills, but rather at the wide range of laws that are to be amended.

Once all the puzzle pieces are put together, the big picture reveals shockingly strict regulations of crypto and a complete overhaul of the idea of “money.” This could have serious effects not only on the crypto sector, but also on the financial system as a whole.

Behind the excuses of preventing money laundering and ensuring investor protection, the use of crypto is transformed in something it was not supposed to be. Especially delicate is the fact that part of this legislation is drafted outside the US.

***Disclaimer***\*: This report provides a high-level overview of the US laws that are to be introduced/amended by two new bills. Its depth is limited by the inadequate knowledge of the author of the large body of US law involved, and given that these bills are subject to amendments and have not even passed into law yet, none of this information can be considered legal or financial advice.\*

&#x200B;

## <What Is Going On?

On April 06, 2021, a “must pass” bill was introduced called the “Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act”(2) (“Infrastructure Bill”). It passed in the House of Representatives and, after fierce debate, the Senate. Hidden in this bill, an amendment to the Internal Revenue Code was added. It introduced new reporting requirements and obligations for record keeping.

While this bill created a lot of public outcry, more recently, a real game-changing bill was introduced in the House on July 28, 2021, namely the: “Digital Asset Market Structure and Investor Protection Act” (3) (“Digital Asset Bill”).

This bill proposes amendments to the Federal Reserve Act, the Bank Secrecy Act, Securities Exchanges Acts, and the Commodity Exchange Act. It changes the definition of legal tender, and it introduces international crypto regulation into US law.

This article looks at each of these amendments…

&#x200B;

## <Commodities or Securities?_

The main take-away is that two different bodies of law will apply to crypto projects: commodities and securities laws. So far, only Bitcoin, Ether, and their hard-forks are confirmed to be commodities (see below). All other cryptos are subject to future guidance by market regulators:

*“Not later than 150 days after the date of the enactment of this section, the SEC and CFTC shall jointly publish, for purposes of a 60-day public comment period, a proposed rulemaking that classifies each of the major digital assets.*

***Not later than 270 days after the date of the enactment of this Act***\*, the SEC and CFTC shall jointly publish a final rule that classifies\* ***each of the top 25 major digital assets*** *by (i) highest market capitalization and (ii) highest daily average trading volume as—*

*(1) a digital asset; or(2) a digital asset security.”* (4)

&#x200B;

## Interpretation:

* Cryptos will be subject to two different regulatory regimes: commodities and security regulations.
* Services engaged with both digital assets (commodities) and digital asset securities (securities) could be subjected to both regulatory regimes.

&#x200B;

## <Commodities Regulation_

The Commodity Exchange Act regulates the trading of commodity futures in the United States. Passed in 1936, it has been amended several times since then.(5) It provides federal regulation of all commodities and futures trading activities and requires all futures and commodity options to be traded on organized exchanges.

In 1974, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) was created to oversee the market. With certain exceptions, the CFTC has been granted exclusive jurisdiction over commodity futures, options, and all other derivatives that fall within the definition of a swap. Certain cryptos will be regulated as commodities.

&#x200B;

## Definition of “Commodity” Amended to Include Digital Asset:

First and foremost, Section 1a of the Commodity Exchange Act on definitions will be amended to read as follows:

*“****The term “commodity” means*** *wheat, cotton, rice, corn, oats, barley, rye, flaxseed, grain sorghums, mill feeds, butter, eggs, Solanum tuberosum (Irish potatoes), wool, wool tops, fats and oils (including lard, tallow, cottonseed oil, peanut oil, soybean oil, and all other fats and oils), cottonseed meal, cottonseed, peanuts, soybeans, soybean meal, livestock, livestock products,* ***digital asset (including Bitcoin, Ether, and their hardforks)****, and frozen concentrated orange juice, and all other goods and articles, except onions (as provided by section 13–1 of this title) and motion picture box office receipts (or any index, measure, value, or data related to such receipts), and all services, rights, and interests (except motion picture box office receipts, or any index, measure, value or data related to such receipts) in which contracts for future delivery are presently or in the future dealt in.”*(6)

&#x200B;

## Digital Asset Definition

Next, the end of Section 1a of the Commodity Exchange Act will be amended by adding a clarification of what a digital asset is (7)(definition to long to post here)

&#x200B;

## Smart Contracts with Delivery Time of More than 24 hours are Futures Contracts

A sharpening of the definition of retail commodity transactions could  decrease the options for the use of smart contracts outside of regulated  exchanges.

Currently, Section 2(c)(2)(D)(i) of the Commodity Exchange Act prohibits persons that are not *“eligible contract participants”* or *“eligible commercial entities”*  to engage in agreements, contract or transactions in commodities on  leverage, margin, or financed by the offeror, the counterparty, or a  person acting in concert with the offeror or counterparty on a similar  basis.(8)

Next,  additional amendments mentioned in the SEC. 202 of the Digital Asset  Bill applies this on transactions done by smart contract of which the  delivery takes longer than 24 hours:

*“(ii)  Exceptions*

*(III) a contract of sale that–*

*(cc)  with respect to* ***digital assets***\*, results in\* ***actual delivery*** *(including  transfer of control over private keys) n****ot later than 24 hours after the  transaction is entered into*** *and such delivery is accomplished by  either-*

*(AA) recording the transaction on the public distributed ledger for the digital asset; or*

*(BB)  with respect to digital which are not recorded on a public distributed  ledger for the digital asset, reporting the transaction to a CFTC  registered digital asset trade repository; or”* (9)

&#x200B;

## Dodd-Frank Act and Market Transparency

After  the 2008 financial crisis, the Dodd-Frank Act introduced strict  regulations for swaps. Naturally, these will also apply to digital  assets as well.

The definition of swaps, as provided by the  Commodity Exchange Act (section 1a(47)) is broad. For example, it could  refer to any “agreement, contract or transaction” that “provides for any  purchase, sale, payment, or delivery that is dependent on the  occurrence, nonoccurrence, or the extent of the occurrence of an event  or contingency associated with a potential financial, economic, or  commercial consequence.” (10)

## Next, the Dodd-Frank bill authorizes the CFTC to:

* Regulate  swap dealers by installing capital and margin requirements, require  dealers to meet robust business conduct standards, and meet  recordkeeping and reporting requirements.
* Increase  transparency and improve pricing in the derivatives marketplace by  requiring standardized derivatives to be traded on regulated exchanges  or swap execution facilities and bring better pricing to the market  place and lower costs for businesses and consumers.
* Lower risk to the American public by moving standardized derivatives to central clearinghouses.(11)

&#x200B;

## Digital Asset Trade Repository

To  meet the above mentioned market transparency requirement, the Commodity  Exchange Act stipulates the need for a digital asset trade repository  to collect information on SWAPS in order to provide the public with the  correct market information:

*“The  term ‘digital asset trade repository’ means any person that collects and  maintains information or records with respect to transactions or  positions in, or the terms and conditions of, contracts of sale of  digital assets in interstate commerce entered into by third parties  (both on chain public distributed ledger transactions as well as off  chain transactions) for the purpose of providing a centralized  recordkeeping facility for any digital asset, but does not include a  private or public distributed ledger or the operator of either such  ledger unless such private or public distributed ledger or operator  seeks to aggregate/include ‘off chain’ transactions as well.”* (12)

&#x200B;

## Interpretation Commodities Regulations:

* As  of writing, only BTC and Ether (and their hard-forks) will be confirmed  as commodities. All other cryptos could potentially be regulated as securities (what this means is explained next).
* The fact that novel technologies such as Bitcoin and Ether are to be  subjected to a large body of law that developed around the trading of  livestock and frozen concentrated orange juice could spell regulatory  uncertainty for various business models in the industry.
* No  “trading on margin” is allowed outside regulated entities, unless done  by high-level investors called “eligible contract parties.” This could  perhaps frustrate particular ideas about decentralized finance or OTC  markets.
* Smart contracts  that take longer than 24 hours to deliver could be considered futures  contracts under the jurisdiction of the CFTC. That smart contracts can  be labeled as futures contracts appears indeed to be the opinion of the  CFTC.(13)

&#x200B;

## <Securities Regulations_

In  the US, securities are regulated by the 1933 Securities Act.  Additionally, the 1934 Securities Exchange Act further regulates the  trade of securities, and established the SEC to oversee these markets.

## Definition of “Security” Amended to Include Digital Asset Security:

First  and foremost, Section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Exchange Act will be  amended to include a “digital asset security” (and exclude “digital  assets”) in the definition of security:

*“(10)* ***The term “security” means***  *any note, stock, treasury stock, security future, security-based swap,  bond, debenture, certificate of interest or participation in any  profit-sharing agreement or in any oil, gas, or other mineral royalty or  lease, any collateral-trust certificate, preorganization certificate or  subscription, transferable share, investment contract,* ***digital asset security***\*,  voting-trust certificate, certificate of deposit for a security, any  put, call, straddle, option, or privilege on any security, certificate  of deposit, or group or index of securities (including any interest  therein or based on the value thereof), or any put, call, straddle,  option, or privilege entered into on a national securities exchange  relating to foreign currency, or in general, any instrument commonly  known as a “security”; or any certificate of interest or participation  in, temporary or interim certificate for, receipt for, or warrant or  right to subscribe to or purchase, any of the foregoing;\* ***but shall not include any fiat currency, commodity, digital asset***\*,  or any note, draft, bill of exchange, or banker’s acceptance which has a  maturity at the time of issuance of not exceeding nine months,  exclusive of days of grace, or any renewal thereof the maturity of which  is likewise limited.”\* (14)

## Digital Asset Security Definition

Next, the Digital Asset Bill (SEC. 101) defines what a digital asset security will be:

*“(A) IN GENERAL.—The term ‘digital asset security’ means a digital asset that:*

*(i) Provides the holder of the digital asset with any of the following rights:*

*(I) Equity or debt interest in the issuer.*

*(II) Right to profits, interest, or dividend payments from the issuer.*

*(III)  Voting rights in the major corporate actions (which shall not include  new block creations, hardforks, or protocol changes related to the  digital asset) of the issuer.*

*(IV) Liquidation rights in the event of the issuer’s liquidation.*

*(ii)  In the case of an issuer with a service, goods, or platform that is not  wholly operational at the time of issuing such digital asset, with  respect to* ***any fundraising or capital formation activity (including initial coin offerings***\*)  which is accomplished through the issuance of such a digital asset,  issues such digital asset to a holder in return for money (including  other digital assets) to fund the development of the proposed service,  goods, or platform of the issuer.”\* (15)

&#x200B;

## What does it mean to be regulated as a security?

Investing in securities in the US is regulated to:

*“protect  interstate commerce, the national credit, the Federal taxing power, to  protect and make more effective the national banking system and Federal  Reserve System, and to insure the maintenance of fair and honest markets  in such transactions.”* (16)

Regulations  focus on both the issuing of securities (primary market), and  subsequent trade of such securities (secondary market).

The goal  of securities laws is firstly to require issuers to fully disclose all  material information that an investor would need in order to make up his  or her mind about the potential investment. A regulated company must  create a registration statement, which includes a prospectus, with  copious amounts of information about the security, the company, the  business, including audited financial statements.

Next, the  subsequent selling and trading in these securities is regulated, by restricting trade to market places over which the regulator has  oversight. The Security Exchange Act section §78l(a) states:

*“It  shall be unlawful for any member, broker, or dealer to effect any  transaction in any security (other than an exempted security) on a  national securities exchange unless a registration is effective as to  such security for such exchange in accordance with the provisions of  this chapter and the rules and regulations thereunder.”* (17)

&#x200B;

## Summary of Securities Regulations:

* Crypto projects will need to be regulated and provide clear financial information for investors to make an informed decision.
* Trading of securities will generally take place on regulated exchanges.
* Any new fundraising or capital formation activity (including ICOs) are likely to be securities.
* When  a crypto is regulated as a security, the entire coin is subject to strict regulations. In the case of commodities, only specific use cases  (futures) are regulated. It is a big difference.
* US  Congress is taking a leap of faith. It needs identifiable persons to enforce a law upon. Who is going to be held accountable in a decentralized network? Many issuing companies have handed control over to network participants. Perhaps for this reason, Section 12(g) of the  Securities Exchange Act of 1934 will be amended to allow the issuer to apply for “desecuritization.” (18)  The question remains: who will apply for desecuritization once a  network is decentralized? The investors? Weren’t they the ones supposed  to be protected in the first place?

&#x200B;

## <Changing the Nature of Money_

These  regulations are not just about crypto. It is clearly part of a wider discussion on the future of money. As shown below, this bill not only  changes the definition of money in the US, but also changes how money is  created!

As a first, in Section 5312(a)(3)(B) of title 31, US  Code (Money and Finance) digital assets are included as a monetary  instrument.(19)  However, Section 5103, of title 31, US Code will be amended to  specifically exclude digital assets and digital asset securities as  legal tender.(20)  And finally, it is determined that digital assets and digital asset securities will not be covered by Federal Deposit Insurance (FDIC or  NCUA).(21)

&#x200B;

## Introducing the Digital USD (or Central Bank Digital Currency/CBDC)

After  slamming the door on digital assets to be used as lawful money, the  Federal Reserve Act is amended to provide the Federal Reserve Board with  far reaching new powers; section 11 will be amended to say:

*“(d) To supervise and regulate through the Secretary of the Treasury the issue and retirement of Federal Reserve notes (****both physical and digital****),  except for the cancellation and destruction, and accounting with  respect to such cancellation and destruction, of notes unfit for  circulation, and to prescribe rules and regulations (****including appropriate technology****) under which such notes may be delivered by the Secretary of the Treasury to the Federal Reserve agents applying therefor.”* (22)

In addition, Federal Reserve notes will in the future also be issued digitally; an amendment to section 16 confirms this:

*“Federal  reserve notes, to be issued at the discretion of the Board of Governors  of the Federal Reserve System for the purpose of making advances to  Federal reserve banks through the Federal reserve agents as hereinafter  set forth and for no other purpose, are authorized. Notwithstanding any  other provision of law, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve  System is* ***authorized to issue digital versions of Federal reserve notes in addition***  *to current physical Federal reserve notes. Further, the Board of  Governors of the Federal Reserve System, after consultation with the  Secretary of the Treasury, is* ***authorized to use distributed ledger technology for the creation, distribution and*** ***recordation of all transactions***  *involving digital Federal reserve notes. The said notes shall be  obligations of the United States and shall be considered legal tender  and shall be receivable by all national and member banks and Federal  reserve banks and for all taxes, customs, and other public dues. They  shall be redeemed in lawful money on demand at the Treasury Department  of the United States, in the city of Washington, District of Columbia,  or at any Federal Reserve bank.”* (23)

&#x200B;

## Interpretations on the Future of Money:

* The door is shut for the use of cryptos as legal tender.
* The  Federal Reserve Board is to be authorized to create and distribute a  ledger-based Federal reserve note that could be used for everyday  transactions in USD.
* Digital  federal reserve notes will make the “recordation” of all transactions  possible. Did they use this word because “monitoring all transactions”  would be too obvious? Recording all transactions without anyone looking  at them makes no sense.
* These  amendments significantly increase the power of the Federal Reserve.  Contrary to what is widely understood, the Fed does not “print money.”  It can only manage the money supply indirectly.(24)  The private sector “creates” most of what we use as money by issuing  credit. It is with the supply of credit by the private banks that the  monetary supply is inflated. Conversely, with the reduced demand for  credit, the money supply deflates. The Fed is not as powerful as it  wants the market to believe, and the Federal Reserve Act restricts a lot  of its actions. This amendment, however, could drastically expand the  authority of the Fed, by allowing them to create and distribute a  “digital USD” directly. It could change the entire structure of the  financial system and potentially have far reaching consequences.
* The  original idea behind the Federal Reserve was for private bank deposits  to be combined to provide an emergency line of credit in times of  economic stress.(25)  But if the Digital Dollar is based on a blockchain, how can it also be  based on reserves? And what mechanism will determine how funds (and how  much) are added to the economy? And where and how will they be  distributed? What about privacy and security? Will all this authority be  handed over to a board of seven unelected bureaucrats? This amendment  has the potential to change the way the Federal Reserve operates. This  deserves a wider discussion by economists and financial experts outside  the crypto-space as well.

&#x200B;

## <International FATF Crypto Regulation Introduced in the US_

Those  paying attention to international anti-money laundering legislation  know that the following sections from the Digital Asset Bill originate  from guidance issued by the FATF (Financial Action Task Force). FATF is  an intra-governmental organization [creating financial legislation](https://decentralizedlegalsystem.com/fatf-bitcoin-regulations-summary/).

In March, the Paris based FATF issued draft guidance(26)  (“FATF Guidance”) on a number of topics. And even though this guidance  hasn’t been finalized, there are already a number of points directly  included in the Digital Asset Bill.

&#x200B;

## Banning the use of Stablecoins

Subchapter  I of chapter 51 of subtitle IV of title 31, United States Code,  department of treasury regulation, will be amended, to read as follows:

*“(a) IN GENERAL.—Beginning on the date of the enactment of this section,* ***no person may issue, use, or permit to be used a digital asset fiat-based stablecoin*** *that is not approved by the Secretary of the Treasury under subsection (b).”*(27)

&#x200B;

## Criminalizing the use of privacy coins and anonymizing services (mixers, coinjoins)

The  bank secrecy act is going to be amended to sanction the use of  anonymity-enhanced convertible virtual currencies and anonymizing  services.(28)  It is worth noting that willful violations of the bank secrecy act  could give rise to a fine of not more than $250,000, or imprisoned for  not more than five years, or both.(29)

&#x200B;

## Introduction of the term Virtual Asset Service Provide (VASP) into US Law

Next, the term Virtual Asset will be introduced into Section  5312(a) of title 31, United States Code. A Virtual Asset can be a  digital asset, or *“a digital representation of value that can be  digitally traded, or transferred, and can be used for payment or  investment purposes;”*(30)

So  far we have seen a number of definitions. To understand their  relationship, the following image was made based on the definition of  Virtual Asset according to Section 5312(a) of title 31, United States  Code:(31)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/buzs5az1dro71.png?width=502&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b1726f091d09a7749d85d8e44af6ea8f5e45b7d

&#x200B;

Virtual  Asset is a broad definition; it covers most activities involving  cryptos. We can see in the Digital Asset Bill that entities that are  facilitating transactions in Virtual Assets are to be called “virtual  asset service providers,” or VASPS. Sec 301 of the Digital Asset Bill  defines a VASP:

*“(A) means a person who—*

*(i) exchanges between digital asset and fiat currencies*

*(ii) exchanges between digital assets;*

*(iii) transfers of digital assets;*

*(iv) is responsible for the custody, safekeeping of a digital asset or an instrument that enables control over a digital asset;*

*(v) issues or has the authority to redeem a digital asset; and*

*(vi) provides financial services related to the offer or sale of a digital asset by a person who issues such digital asset; and*

*(B) does not include any person who—*

*(i) obtains a digital asset to purchase goods or services for themself;*

*(ii) provides communication service or network access services used by a money transmitter; or*

*(iii)  develops, creates, or disseminates software designed to be used to  issue a digital asset or facilitate financial activities associated with  a digital asset.”* (32)

This  definition comes directly from the FATF Guidance, with the only  difference being that the US excludes the exchange between different  forms of one virtual assets. On the other hand, section (v) is a new  addition.

&#x200B;

## The Big Picture: Global Regulation

The logic  behind this seems to be to first introduce a high-level definition  (including coins regulated as commodities, securities, and everything in  between). Next, any future global restrictions on the wider  crypto-space can be applied at this level.

From the latest FATF  Guidance, a number of possible additional restrictions can already be  deducted. Things to look out for are the restriction of the use of  “unhosted wallets,” the introduction of the “travel rule,” labeling  those who engage in peer-to-peer transactions as a risk, and a whole  host of other measures. (33)

One  additional aspect of VASP regulation mentioned in the FATF Guidance is  also included in the Digital Asset Bill; VASPS engaged in services which  are available in the United States and to United States persons, have  to be regulated in the United States, even if the provider is located  outside the United States. (34)

## Interpretation International Regulation in the US:

* International AML legislation, created by Paris-based FATF, is being introduced in the US.
* The  FATF term “virtual asset service provider” (VASP) is introduced in the  US. The definition is so broad that it covers practically all crypto  projects.
* After first being  in the FATF Guidance, the banning of stablecoins and anonymity-enhanced  cryptos and the obligation for VASPs to be licensed in the country of  their clients are included in the Digital Asset Bill.
* It  is not hard to imagine that other restrictions for cryptos currently  discussed by FATF, such as the travel rule and restricting unhosted  wallets, will be introduced next. This is not a regulation you introduce  to then never use.
* All VASPs with operating in the US or with US clients need to be regulated in the US.

&#x200B;

## <Amendments in the Infrastructure Bill_

Last  August saw public outcry over the US Infrastructure bill. It included a  section on IRS reporting for crypto. Some highlights:

## Clarification of Definition of Broker

It  makes sense that the tax authorities use a wide definition to cover all  possible economic activities in crypto. Section 80603 of the  Infrastructure Bill amendments the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,  provides that brokers need to report the activity of their clients to  the IRS and adds the following to the definition of broker:

*“(D)  any person who (for consideration) is responsible for regularly  providing any service effectuating transfers of digital assets on behalf  of another person.”* (35)

## Reporting of Digital Assets

In addition, a unique wide definition of digital assets is added:

*“any  digital representation of value which is recorded on a  cryptographically secured distributed ledger or any similar technology  as specified by the Secretary.”* (36)

## Effective Date

Effective after December 31, 2023.

&#x200B;

## Interpretation Infrastructure Bill

Commotion about this bill was mainly due to the wide definitions used, which could cover all activities in the crypto space,  including mining. In response, according to an article on Bloomberg,  the U.S. treasury will shortly issue additional guidance, along the  lines of the following:

*“Other  firms key to the nearly $2 trillion crypto market — from developers and  miners to hardware and software providers — won’t have any new  requirements, so long as they don’t also act as brokers, according to a  Treasury official”* (37)

At  a glance, it appears that this bill is not as invasive as originally  feared. It would also be impossible to enforce this legislation on  miners due to the nature of the technology.

In this case perhaps it would have been better if clear definitions were used of what is, and  isn’t included. Moreover, comments from “anonymous sources at the  treasury” do not provide real regulatory clarity. This industry too easily accepts the opinions of officials as decree. But we are all,  including officials, subject to the law. Given that officials change over time, opinions and guidance are not the way forward; clear laws are needed.

# <TL;DR_

**Next to the infrastructure bill, a new bill was introduced in US Congress: the “Digital Asset Market Structure and Investor Protection Act.” It is not law yet, could still be amended, and if it ever comes into effect it will likely not be this year/cycle. What it says:**

**Bitcoin, Ether, and their hard-forks, are to be regulated as commodities. Smart-contracts taking longer to deliver than 24 hours are considered futures contracts and regulated as such.**

**Every other project and future ICO is potentially a security; guidance will be issued by CFTC/SEC. Issuers of securities are likely required to provide transparency and financial information to investors. Trade is generally restricted to regulated exchanges.**

**In addition, international anti-money laundering legislation is introduced in the US; (unauthorized) Stablecoins, privacycoins, and mixers are to be prohibited. The high-level term VASP is introduced for almost all crypto projects, possibly to facilitate more future regulations.**

**Finally, the Federal Reserve gets shocking new powers to create and distribute a central bank digital currency (CBDC), of which all transactions are recorded.**

Today is a big day for me. I just sold all of my crypto to pay lawyers and paperwork to get my italian citizenship.

Last year I made two goals (my moons), first one was the prices of everything related to paperwork/lawyers etc and the second was the ticket and life in Italy for at least 3 months while I wait for the citizenship to get a job.

Today I hit my first one.

I was saving money and last year I started saving it on crypto as well and today was the day that I finally got enough to pay all the paperwork/lawyers fees/translations.

I will start saving again from next month on because after the paperwork is done I need to go to Italy to start the process of the citizenship there and of course, crypto is the future!

I’m in Argentina but my great-grandfather came from Italy, so by blood and proving it I have the right to get the citizenship. It’s a long and expensive process but worth it. I don’t know what to expect when I get to Europe but I hope it will be better than here and more opportunities to succeed. 

100 years ago he came looking for a better life, now it’s my turn.

Anyways, just wanted to write this here because reddit was really important to me and I want to thank all of you, even tho I am not present writing stuff all the time I always connect to read your stories and advices, grazie a tutti!

Edit:

Guys, thank you for all your messages!

I didn’t expect so many, i’m really glad you guys liked reading my story and I’ll reply each of you.

Just to clarify:

I’m from Brazil but been living in Argentina for the past 3 years, my family is all in Brazil and nobody went back to Italy still, I can be the first one doing it!

I didn’t sell to BUY the italian citizenship, I sold to pay my lawyer to ask the judge for a new birth certificate because my grandad wasn’t registered when he was born.

The saved crypto I had isn’t for the whole process yet, next month I’ll go back to saving again!

I was able to buy BTC last year and been saving since then with this idea (my first moon).

Thanks so much again!",positive,0.89829475,3964

Proposal: give customers the option to buy up to $20,000 of Coinbase stock at IPO price.

I have a strong feeling that Coinbase will be pressured by Wall Street against this idea. Please upvote if you agree with this. 

This is about an even playing field. We do not want to see the traditional IPO with bankers buying the stock at IPO price and selling it at a 50 percent or 100 premium to the general public.

We the users who have contributed to Coinbase’s success deserve this.

EDIT: to all those who say this isn’t technically possible... AIRBNB just did this 2 weeks ago at their IPO. I know because my friend (who is a host and not an accredited investor) bought 150 shares at IPO price.

Want proof? Okay: https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/10/airbnb-hosts-profit-from-ipo-pop-spreading-wealth-beyond-investors.html

375,2021-11-11,"I work in a bank, and see blocked accounts every day without reason. Here's why Bitcoin is necessary.There is hardly a week where someone doesn't come in, asking why their account was blocked for 'review purposes'. And let me tell you, most of those times they are blocked for no apparent reasons. I had plenty of those whose accounts have been blocked for weeks, they had no access to their money, and in the end, the 'suspicious transactions' were transfers from family, or, even funnier, someone e withdraw THEIR OWN MONEY from bank A, transferred to bank B and then back to bank A. 
And my bank has the audacity to ask about the source of funds, depriving them of often their only money source. Because banks don't allow you to withdraw anything until they are done doing their review. And what happens when it turns out to be banks mistake? You can file a complaint and... That's about it. Go deal on your own with the investments you lost, food that you didn't have etc. 
Here is why Bitcoin is needed. So that some enormous corporation can't ask you 'Where did that $1000 come from?'. Oh, and if you answer them the same day, good luck getting an answer in anything less than 2 weeks. They just don't care, as long as they can work your 'potentially unearned' funds.

Also, they block your accounts if you invest in BTC. because terrorism, right? No, because they want you to put your money into their 'fantastic deal' 0.01% APR savings accounts, instead of staking for a MUCH higher percentage.",positive,0.6781828,3835

386,2021-06-16,"I put my entire savings 20,000$ into Bitcoin. With the intent to hold my savings in Bitcoin instead of fiat.I've pulled the trigger, after thinking over it for a few weeks. 

I'm a software engineer who has spent the last 6 months developing payment processing services for Bitcoin and other crypto assets. I've had the pleasure of exploring and learning about how blockchain works, how transactions work, and its security at a deep level. Most importantly I've learned about just how much utility Bitcoin has to offer.

As I hear about more services, companies, and now countries are adopting Bitcoin, it's very clear that it's here to stay. But most importantly it's already started to begin reaching the ""soccer mom"" audience. People ""use"" Bitcoin, not just as an investment, or a get rich quick scheme. They use it to barter, pay bills, trade, and as a means of exchange for goods and services.

I don't just see Bitcoin as a chart in an app. I don't see Bitcoin as something you buy with USD. I see Bitcoin as Bitcoin. It's a currency in its own right, with value dictinct from USD and others. And given a decade, or two. I see it as the global currency for the future of all transactions.

Thanks for hearing my points.

Edit: A notice to those saying I'm making a mistake. I have no debt and if this money were to vanish tomorrow I'd be sad, but by no means will I lose my house, go hungry, lose medical coverage, or anything like that. I believe in Bitcoin as a primary currency and store of value, and want to hold my savings in Bitcoin.

Additionally, the US has a currency (USD), Japan has a currency (JPY), Canada has a currency (CAD), yet it's far fetched to believe the internet can't have a currency (BTC)? Bitcoin is a currency in my world view, not just an asset. If you don't agree, then wish me ill will and move on.",positive,0.9019292,3774
387,2021-01-29,"After GME I finally understand BitcoinThe [/r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) GME retail investors vs the 0.1% situation has lead me to a place of clarity. The game is rigged, and the owners of the system will react with haste and break any laws they must to protect their cartel. For those not following the event

\- Retail investors, realised the shares of GME and some other companies were heavily shorted and in short supply, so they started buying in the hope of forcing a short squeeze (whereby the holder of the shorts will then have to buy more stock to cover their shorts, sending the price through the roof, an example is Volkswagen \[VW\] in the 2000's). This is perfectly legal.

\- the plan worked, GME went from $2 to $470 in a short space of time.

\- Melvin Capital, a Hedge fund took a massive (likely $6 billion) short position in GME and faced closure if the bet went against them, they were losing money at a fast rate and got a bail out last week by other wall street Hedge funds.

\- Melvin Capital then went on CNBC and other networks to reveal they had closed their short positions, it's highly unlikely as the options volume did not back up their claim, they were simply spreading disinformation, again this is perfectly legal

\- the retail investors at [/r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) simply would not give up, they kept buying, the end goal could have seen the stock reach $5K based on the VW scenario.

\- the 0.1% moved to then protect the 0.1% from losing money by using the stock brokerages they own or control(Robinhood, TD, IB and all the other big players) to firstly prevent the retail investors buying more stock, you could simply not buy these stocks, you could only sell, some companies even forcibly closed down open options positons even in the absense of margin calls, so your account is in good standing with enough liquidity and they decide which stock you can have and which you can not, in this time big institutions are allowed to buy as much of this stock as they desire, just the retail traders are locked out of the casino. This is highly illegal and known as market manipulation, it also flies in the face of the idea that we have a free market.

\- people like AOC, Elon Musk, Chamath have all come out on the site of the retail traders at [/r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) 

\- Interactive Brokers chairman and founder Thomas Peterffy goes on CNBC’s “Closing Bell” an is literally weeping, explaining he feels hurt that his large, moneyed 0.1% friends are losing money due to the retail investors, oh the horror, how can these small investors make my friends lose money? Don't they know the implications of their actions? The horror.

The guys at [/r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) simply did not understand that in our world only old money gets to make real money, the little guy must be shut down and should never have a slice of the action, all he gets is inflation and a 9 to 5 job, plus side hustle if he/she's lucky. If the little guy ever finds a way to gain an advantage the loophole is quickly closed.

\- the SEC Chair then threatens to investigate the redditors on [/r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) by tracking down their IP numbers with the help of reddit

\- The [/r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) discord server is banned.

Recently, I've started to observe my emotions more seriously during the market moves and I've had valuable insights while doing so: *what I am feeling right now is probably very close to what many other investors are feeling*. This is great to know. It helps me to estimate how the market might react in real time.

I've joined this sub in 2013 and my first buy was in Dec 2013 during an *epic* leg up. Bitcoin crashed upwards like I've never seen again. Incredibly, though, I almost timed the top perfectly and bought in right before it crashed down again, ultimately moving from around 1k to 350 or so. Imagine my feelies. I was naive and very new. But the reason I've joined was a bit different than the reasons moon bois are joining today. Back then, Bitcoin was pure magic. And it was subversive. It was a big F U you to the banks. That was the selling argument. And it was always clear to me since then that Bitcoin is either going to 0 or to infinity. I still believe that today. 

After my first buy, I was in the red immediately. Double digit percent loss. But my conviction was strong. I've spent the next months reading and understanding BTC. I've practiced with lots of different wallets, I've sent transactions around (they were still free back then, yes, 0 transaction fees) and generally got comfortable with using it. I noticed that, yes, this technology is insane, and yes, I can send anything to anyone, it takes a couple minutes, and yes, it's almost free, and yes, nobody can do anything about it. 

Remember, I was a complete noob who was down 25%, 50%, 65% his investment. But I'm not an idiot. I know it will go to infinity and the chance of it going to zero is so low that I've decided to keep buying like a retard. I've started putting almost all the money I've got into it (I was a very poor student back in the days, don't get too excited). I figured ""the lower my buy-in price is, the earlier I will be in the green"". Long story short, I've been red for almost two f*cking years. Can you imagine being red for two years and still keep buying? One part of me was extremely scared (""I am YOLOing all of my money into this thing that might just fail"") and extremely bullish at the same time (""this shit will go to infinity but it might take a couple decades""). 

Then 2017 came and we've experienced a wild increase of the price to 20k. Even my family got involved at some point because they've seen my huge gains and got FOMO. My mother turned her 5k into an equivalent of 50k. They started to interfere with my plan and give me (well meant) suggestions on when I should sell. Of course they didn't get it, they are too old to imagine a cyber future where this stash of satoshis will be the ultimate commodity. There was insane FUD around, including the biggest FUD I've ever seen, which was the block size wars (look them up if you don't remember it). Then the crash of 2018 came and everything evaporated. 

However, from this bull run onwards, I've never been in a loss ever again. The price never went lower than my average buy-in but that actually made my feelies even harder to manage. Now my thoughts weren't ""Oh no, you could end up with a loss"" but ""OH NO YOU MIGHT END UP BEING TOO STUPID TO TAKE A PROFIT"" which was way more frightening and ego-crushing. Although I had hands made of diamonds, I've had several moments in the year-long crash that followed where I almost sold. We saw 20k, 10k, even 6k, and I still believe that the fact that I use a hardware wallet (and not keep my sats on an exchange) is what ultimately saved me from making one of the biggest mistakes of my life, which would've been selling my stash at 6k.

Fast forward 2020. How things can change. The covid crash to 3500 was completely different. I've seen the price drop in real time which triggered the most bullish sentiment in me that I've ever experienced. Without a doubt of seeing this as an incredible opportunity to buy, I threw a bunch of money in and converted it to BTC. I knew that BTC was on a fire sale! And then we've seen the beautiful (but this time not so mind-bending) bull run of 2020. 

Now, BTC is not only about cypher punks anymore. The game is world domination. I started to understand the waaaaaay bigger implications that this will bring to the world. Money is broken. The world is broken. Our governments are going nuts. Our politicians are noobs. And society is full of fear. I wonder if there is an asset that is invincible and that spreads freedom tech by infiltrating the hearts of people by promising them huge gains... Mhhhh! 

And now we're here. I look around this sub and all I see is myself. Many new people in this sub, many people afraid of losing their hard-earned money. I completely get it. It's how I felt. It is a lot harder to stomach if you haven't put in the time to learn about the tech. But that's why we're in this sub, to support each other. And I'm not saying that to sound corny, I'm saying that because I've experienced it 100% myself. Without this sub, I wouldn't have been able to recharge my batteries, rethink my strategy, reaffirm my conviction, and observe the development of bitcoin in real time. I wouldn't have seen masses of people giving emotional support to each other, because at the end of the day, this is what controls these price movements. Emotions. 

So, if you feel afraid right now. If you feel like you've made a huge mistake, if you feel like this could've been a bad decision, then good, this is what a huge part of the market is thinking right now. Observe your feelings, judge them with distance, extrapolate them to the masses of people also looking at exactly the same chart as you do. And start using that information *for you*. Fear is a part of the equation and the reason I've written up this long-ass post is so you can appreciate this without having to go through hell first, like I did. What you are feeling right now is almost ""priced in"". Money can be made when there is blood on the streets. 

That's my advice. Do not buy the next best shitcoin. Nothing is even close to becoming a ""replacement"" for BTC. Ask yourself why you like Bitcoin, learn as much as you possibly can (I highly recommend listening to the hundreds of hours of articles in the Bitcoin Audible Podcast) and keep stacking if you know why you're doing it. That's it, I'm out! Peace! 

TL;DR: Breath in, breath out, and HODL!

463,2021-02-17,"This aged well: Woman divorces husband for reading r/Bitcoin (aka cult of clueless idiots) and HODLing too much BTC... in 2014. Get ready to laugh.. extremely entertaining read.I remember reading an old r/relationships post about a woman who was furious at her husband for his ""cult like"" belief in bitcoin and mocked him for thinking he was ""in at the ground floor"". She goes off on a diatribe and mocks him every chance he gets for his ""foolish"" beliefs and how he spends his money on buying and holding bitcoin... she consider any bitcoin that he holds to be ""lost money"".

I actually saved this when I read it back years ago to see one day how it would age... man talk about the worlds biggest I told you so. She had zero faith and respect in her husband. I hope he has a garage full of lambos in his giant mansion.

Here are some of the highlights  snipped for your own entertainment:

\-------

&#x200B;

""My husband (I'll call him John for the sake of anonymity) and I have been married for a little over 5 years now and everything has been going well up until a year or so ago. We were planning on having children and everything. Now my life feels like it is at a complete stand still.""

Skip to 2013...

"" We are both avid redditors so when we find a new subreddit that we love we get excited and start sending each other links to see if we can get the other one interested  He finds out about bitcoin and is sending me links constantly about it.  (r/bitcoin) It goes from ""check out this cool technology"" to absolute cultish behavior in a very brief period. I would say 0-100 in probably 2 months. He starts taking every dime we have and buying them as quickly as he can. **He actually set up a feature that BUYS MORE ON A WEEKLY BASIS** after our paychecks come through. The worst part is he didn't even TELL ME he did this. He gave me this arrogant response about doing what's best for us and our future kids.

Overall, and I'm not exaggerating, I would say **we have lost over $22,000.** I kept telling him to sell as the price was rising and he promised me a big year in 2014. **The price kept falling and he CONTINUED TO BUY MORE.**  He makes more money than I do but we are building a future together and we have a shared bank account. He kept telling me this was for our kids college fund, to buy a house, etc. The money...I can get over as people spend money on other stupid crap like boats they will never use but this isn't even the beginning to the absolute craziness I will see out of him over the coming year.

My husband starts bringing up fucking bitcoin at these events. MY events for MY job. People here have a lot of money and he knows this. He saw this as some kind of opportunity. He goes on and on about how taxes are theft and bitcoin is a way out. The dollar is about to collapse, banks are destroying the world, etc. You are supposed to make light hearted jokes about how their football team is doing, not get into these political discussions. He knows this too since he's been coming to these events with me for years.

It starts off small where I laugh it off and say ""ohhhh John, he's into technology and gets a little too excited"". He saw this as condescension. The car rides home? Full on fights about how **I don't get it and I'm going to be left behind.** I felt like I was fighting with some type of evangelical Christian (I have been in plenty of these growing up). He ironically rips into religion any chance he gets but he is **absolutely part of a cult full of insane people.**

Keep in mind as this goes on he is still buying more as the **price goes down telling me we have a great opportunity on our hands**.  He ignores long term trends and focuses on these specific time frames to show me how stupid I am. Yes, my husband called me STUPID over THINKING I do not understand it.

I feel like I have read more about bitcoin than he has because he won't discuss any downsides with me. He tells me all problems will be fixed and **we are in on the ground floor**. He seems to be in a constant good news bubble about this **when no one actually cares**. Most of the responses he gets from people in public are feigned interest until they can get away from him or they just tell him they don't care if the converstaion lasts more than 2 minutes. **I am embarrassed to be around him.**

After a **recent price crash, he actually bought more using our vacation fund** that I have been saving away for AND planning. **All gone, in bitcoin never to be seen again.**

I am sorry for the long rant but this is my life now. I have tried everything. I have tried reasoning with him. I have tried explaining to him that he should not have sole control over our money. **He is so confident that he slyly brings up selling one of our cars to buy more**. He didn't come right out and say what it was for but I can guarantee you it was to buy more. He is ruining my job and **robbing me of happiness.**

I used to consider him a smart guy and **I never, ever thought he would succomb to basically being brainwashed by a bunch of clueless idiots on the internet who seem to know absolutely nothing about finance or the real world (**r/bitcoin**).** I don't know how familiar people are here with bitcoin but if you go to their subreddit, you will see exactly what I'm talking about. I started crying once reading my husband's comments worded slightly differently, repeated 100 times over. It was like I married a parrot.

What do I DO? I am not religious in any way but my family most certainly is. **I feel like I couldn't even bring up divorce and I want to save my husband.** I want him back to the way he was. It seems like he is addicted to a drug but since he doesn't realize it, everyone else is wrong. I don't know if I should have an intervention or just walk away and hope he comes to his senses when **I'm staying in a hotel for a few weeks.**

Again, I apologize for the length but I want you to feel the way I feel so you can understand the advice you are giving. I really need help here. Thank you to anyone who even reads half of this!

Man I am so glad I'm not married. You're gonna want your husband when those bitcoins are worth fortunes.... hopefully HE's gonna divorce you before that because you don't deserve any of it.

To your husband I say... keep holding those coins brother.

470,2021-03-03,"Due Diligence on BitcoinHi everyone,

I've been trying to evaluate on my own whether bitcoin is worth buying and holding long term and wanted to present to you some basic findings. This is not financial advice but my own research analysis and I am open to being corrected as I am still new. I see a lot of DD for stocks but not as much here so I am hoping we can also get some more quality content here to share knowledge. I am someone who has bought and sold bitcoin at a loss back in 2017-2018, and then again 2020-2021. Yes, I saw all the ""HODL"" posts, but I was only in it for attempted financial gain. I've only recently spent the time to look into bitcoin and become a believer.

**Supply**: First, Bitcoin has a fixed supply. Right now there are 900 bitcoins mined per day. Every four years the number of Bitcoins produced per block (created every 10 minutes) are cut in half. Currently the mining reward is 6.25 Bitcoin per block. In 2024 it will drop to 3.125 BTC per block. So we are beginning to see something we learned in our high school Economics class called Scarcity.

[https:\/\/institutional.fidelity.com\/app\/literature\/item\/9901337.html?pos=T](https://preview.redd.it/xqveh5ei8vk61.png?width=359&format=png&auto=webp&s=eff083c195e1aa24ede9ce998708f1d2c0f53f83)

**Demand**: Next is demand. It doesn't matter if there's less of a resource no one wants. There is a lot to look at here (i.e. Bitcoin ATM installations increased by +85% in 2020 to 11,798 terminals, outpacing the previous year’s near +50% rise by a significant margin, according to data source Coin ATM Radar). But the big one we are all most excited about is the change in institutional money flowing in. For those that don't know Metcalfe’s Law, it holds that as the number of its users grows linearly, a network’s value (or, by inference, the bitcoin price) grows geometrically. In other words, there is a cascading effect where more and more institutions begin exponentially buying in *worldwide*. Right now 30% of all U.S. buyers are institutions. This is a big deal because institutions have more money than you, and that means if they keep buying, our clock window to buy at our current price is now ticking.

**Indicators**: The first decade was marked by speculation and pushback. And Bitcoin prices reflected that. I know for a lot of us, me included, we want indicators to show that prices will go up. But something I'd like to propose for your consideration also: The maturation of an ecosystem tends to result in fresh consolidation. Because we are still in a stage of Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD), this is good news for you - it means we are only now beginning to exit the early adaptor stage. It's not too late to buy. As more and more people have bitcoin, it will begin its slow inevitable march towards mainstream as a dependable store of value. This is why the next chart I want to show you is not just money, but people. More and more people are bitcoin owners. More and more people start talking and googling and investing. Metcalfe’s Law, remember?

[https:\/\/www.lookintobitcoin.com\/charts\/wallets-greater-than-1-btc\/](https://preview.redd.it/ndk2uz1t7vk61.png?width=1117&format=png&auto=webp&s=34386a60c29ff9950d506a7899030441a4220200)

**Inflation/Depreciation**: When I was a kid I remember reading a book called ""Rich Dad Poor Dad"" where the premise was to put your money in assets that make more money, not less. Putting your money in things that depreciate (i.e. a car) loses you money over time, while things that appreciate (i.e. a house) make more money. A popular Bitcoin valuation chart is called the Stock-to-Flow (S2F) pricing model. Notice how as Bitcoin becomes more scarce due to halving's, it exponentially grows. Next, notice how your hard earned U.S. Dollar has depreciated by 99% the past hundred years to gold, which has been traditionally the ""gold standard"" of storage. Guys, this is seriously starting to look like a no brainer to me.

**Regulation**: This something not completely known to any of us. Despite the price volatility, what if the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and Securities or Exchange Commission (SEC) tried to in some way limit or outright ban Bitcoin? I take comfort that institutions are adopting and even big retail investors are adding Bitcoin as part of their overall asset portfolio. Regulation is not always bad and can provide us a layer security from a ""Mt. Gox"" happening to us again. There is a stable coin called Tether that is being investigated and other legitimate FUD concerns. But with Coinbase's soon IPO, and large positions on the news from the likes of Tesla, there is more safety and certainty. Do understand that your faith is currently paid to you at a premium. Once all FUD and volatility from Bitcoin is removed, it's skyrocketing price will reflect that.

[In December 2020, the SEC announced they would allow “crypto-focused broker-dealers to operate for five years without fear of an enforcement action provided that they can verify if they have possession and control of customers’ digital asset securities https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/rules\/policy\/2020\/34-90788.pdf](https://preview.redd.it/gfyk4m81mvk61.png?width=644&format=png&auto=webp&s=a957eec2e5367ad36acf68cd26e6d320f9818477)

**Competition**: Cryptocurrency is not just limited to Bitcoin, there are many ""altcoins."" But analysts have been pointing to Bitcoin as the ""north star"" of all other cryptocurrencies and welcome mainstream adaption of cryptocurrencies as a portfolio diversifier. Bitcoin helps illuminate the financial industry’s path. There are new technologies and advancements being made too for the ""inefficiencies"" of Bitcoin. Efforts to improve Bitcoin’s processing speed are underway such as a new scaling technology called the Lightning Network.

[https:\/\/ir.citi.com\/peFJTnzeEoMSIAEFlwH12VeM5d&#37;2BCckWNrsO9lxpmyWezrz5V&#37;2Bx&#37;2FfRvm0gv6cWRpDHGWtIk7sTME&#37;3D](https://preview.redd.it/t74wwd7edvk61.png?width=660&format=png&auto=webp&s=86efc9bd3a7aaf40556c7d516779594edc53e884)

**Conclusion**: Bitcoin has gone mainstream and is considered a legitimate asset class of digital gold by more and more investors. Bitcoin has a proven supply dynamic (S2F) and demand dynamic (Metcalfe’s Law). With banks printing money to infinity, the question for you is:

*With all this information, is bitcoin worth a portion of your portfolio?*

If your answer is ""*yes*"" then Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) of buying and holding bitcoin appears to be a viable investment. I do not think this is an asset class to sell anymore. Notice nowhere in this writeup did I talk about getting rich quick off bitcoin's prices. I'm a firm believer that ""time in the market beats timing the market,"" and so I will be buying and holding because I believe in the future of bitcoin.

The ""meta shift"" I have seen over the past 7 months bothers me. Nobody wants to talk about bitcoin. Nobody wants to discuss mass adoption of bitcoin. Nobody wants to talk about liberating the Lebanese freelance artist or the Iranian just trying to buy games on steam or the village in rural Kenya that is located a 3-hour-walk away from the closest bank. Nobody wants to talk about DLCs and smart contracts on bitcoin or the best non-custodial lightning network wallets. No one is talking about taproot.                

No one is talking about how the creator of bitcoin never sold his coins. People are forgetting the first cryptocurrency that was ever created. People are forgetting metcalfes law.                 

What I find ultimately more disturbing is that during the 2018-2020 bear market more people were talking about / cared to talk about bitcoin than altcoins. It just feels like a hivemind of ""pump my bags"" and little more.               

This is just a slight rant. It's like everyone there delusionally believes that an altcoin will surpass bitcoin and become the standard. If there is going to be another bear market, I welcome it. Just so we can go back to talking about bitcoin and lightning and the technology aspects of it all.                 

EDIT: I strongly feel as though the majority of the new users that we have accumulated since this bull run began are coming from /r/wallstreetbets and /r/dogecoin.

EDIT 3: I see that there is a cross post of this thread to the cc subreddit. To further refine my claims to the belief that no crypto will surpass bitcoin, I responded to a comment someone else here made with the following: All of these questions summarize ""Why bitcoin is the next bitcoin.'"" 

>Which coin is the ""next bitcoin?"" or in other words, the one coin that will replace bitcoin? Why is it that coin and not bitcoin? And how do you convince all of the banks and the traditional financial system to switch to that coin and not use bitcoin? Why would they switch to that coin and not use bitcoin? Why not use both?

Many students have already asked me about Bitcoin and other coins. There are many ways to explain “what” Bitcoin is, and I see many more in the comments! I do not plan on talking anything market related. I just want to answer their question “what is this Bitcoin thing people are talking about?” And hopefully open the door to future lessons on what money is and the history of it. 

Also: I teach at a Charter. Long story short - I do what I want!

Edit 3: Some people are saying that because they’re 8th graders it’s not worth teaching them. When students are constantly coming up to you and asking you about BTC and DOGE and SafeShit, I liken that sentiment to teaching them about sex. They are talking about it themselves, so why not treat them as young adults and educate them? Refusing to respond to a student about Bitcoin will likely end up with them buying some scam coin. We teach then stocks as well. Not wanting to teach them what it is because it can be likened to gambling is absurd.

Edit 4:  Wow there are some comments from people who obviously have some residual trauma from people who hurt them. Read the damn title. You can always tell who isn’t a teacher - they are always trying to tell teachers how and what to teach (with horrible grammar, I may add ). Maybe, for the first week of class while we are getting students acclimated to being back in school, we ease into content. Instead, give them lessons on material not covered in a curriculum and try to forge relationships going into a new year. 
Also if you don’t like Bitcoin, why the fuck are you on r/Bitcoin? Sounds like you need r/buttcoin.

Edit 5: Just found out from members of my grade level team that many of them are wanting to talk finances and whatnot and want to plan together to make our little free lessons a little more cohesive and centered around financial literacy. Because we will be using the first week to go over norms and protocols and all the other stuff, we each now have a total of 2 hours over the week for a free lesson, particularly ones that students have shown interest in (e.g., Bitcoin). This means I am now planning a 4 part lesson about money, starting with bartering, to coins, to paper money, to fiat money, plastic money, and then to internet money. This is going to blend very well with another teacher who is going to give a crash course on what the internet (of information) is.

First off, as Ecclesiastes 1:9 states:
>What has been will be again,

>  what has been done will be done again;

> there is nothing new under the sun.


Over the last 7 years I have seen all these questions about what to do, these statements of selling, and others commenting how stupid and ignorant anyone who sells “right now” must be. People have called me a fucking moron for daring to part with some of my bitcoin, or argued with me that I don’t understand what I did. They are sad people (jealous? myopic? entitled? I still don’t know what they are trying to prove.) 


Secondly: I’m certain a number of you will not believe my story. That is your right. I will not provide tx-id’s or any other form of proof. I just ask that you look at my post history and ponder – either this guy made up a story several years ago and stuck to it, posting every so often between /r/bitcoin and /r/financialindependence for magic internet points or maybe he is telling the truth.

**The story** 

I got into bitcoin back in 2013 or so, reading about it and really going down the rabbit hole. I am a scientist, and it is my nature to go deep on things of interest. One thing I learned in my graduate studies was “how to learn” (how to research). For you whippersnappers – that means more than Google and YouTube. So I learned, I read, I watched interviews, I set up a node, I mined shitcoins to understand how that worked (and traded them for bitcoin in the end.) Nobody I knew was into bitcoin, and nobody would listen to me about it. I tried to get my brother interested. I tried to get a tech friend interested. Both of them agreed it was “interesting” but not enough to acquire any bitcoin (this was around the time of bitcoin being just under $1k, before it dropped for several years post MtGox meltdown). So I carried on alone, with just the interwebs to console me.

In 2017 when bitcoin hit $4,000 or so, I sold 40 - enough to pay off my mortgage and cover my original costs to acquire all my holdings (avg sale price $4320). If bitcoin ate shit and died, I had a good ride, and had a paid off house to boot. I think it was a week or two later that it was $8,000. Then soon after it almost hit $20k and started dropping. I didn’t panic, but I woke up in mid-December and my brain screamed “don’t be greedy” to me. I listened to my brain and sold 60 BTC at around $15.6k each. Additionally, as I had my coins on Coinbase, when they opened trading for BCH in late December I dumped them within the first hour for around $3550 each. When all was said and done I had made somewhere near 1.5M USD. 


If you have questions about how much I paid in taxes, how I moved the money, if my bank gave a shit (spoiler: they did not) etc. it’s covered in [this post]( https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/fxho4v/stop_the_bullshit_if_you_sell_your_btc_on/) with details asked in the comments. You also get to see people tell me I am wrong, so there’s that fun as well. 


I kept the rest of my BTC, and watched the price shrink down over the next couple years. I wondered if I had made a mistake by not cashing out, missed my “big chance for maxxx profits” or whatever, but it didn’t really matter that much because a few months after I made the initial money and paid my taxes, **I fucking retired**. Yes, as of almost 3 years ago, I retired. It wasn’t only because of the bitcoin – I had saved money, had a 401k, and an IRA. I was on my way to a modest retirement somewhere in my 50’s or so if I wanted it, but then BOOM, I had a huge nest egg, a paid off house, other savings, and additional bitcoin for the future. Cool. kthxbye work world!


I have spent the last 3 years leisurely pursuing my own things like art and music, woodworking, collage, gardening along with sleeping in and lots of meditation and porch dwelling. There have been several small tragedies in my life since then (parents in poor health, for one) and so I have been able to tend to that more so than I could if I was working. Being retired has given me so many options and so much control over my life. I love it.


Some of you might be thinking something along the lines of - Now here we are…bitcoin is worth $40k so roughly speaking this guy (me) “lost out” so far on about 2.4M after taxes. There’s also the fact that if I had kept working these last 3 years I would have additional income/savings that I could have invested so let’s round up to 3M after taxes, assuming I sold the 100 BTC now and the BCH immediately (I’m not a fan, and actually am surprised it didn’t die). How do I feel about losing out on $3M (and counting)? Honestly, not particularly bad.

Here’s the deal – when you get to a certain point in your net worth, where you can cover your costs for your lifestyle and more (and this number is different for everyone, for me I’m really chill, so no lambo interests) the money sort of converts itself into a score like on a video game. I can look back and think “oh man, 3 million fucking dollars more! Oh shit!” but do I lose sleep over it? No. Do I kick myself? Not really. My score is lower than it could have been… but in return, I got to help a friend die peacefully, I helped another friend pivot his business, I moved to a new city and bought a cool house (still own the old one as a rental, but maybe not for much longer), and I get to wake up every day and do exactly what I want to do (minus covid issues). It’s really nice to be out of the rat race. It suits me well. I know now that I could have made more - but at the time I had no clue, and there is something to be said for the comfort of the sure thing. 


My base take is this – we only have so much time on this planet, and I’d like to maximize my control (vs. my wealth) as much as possible. It would be hard to imagine reliving the last 3 years with a full time job, and I don’t care to dwell on what might have been. I hit my retirement number (1.5x my number + remaining BTC) and GTFO of the system. That money has grown in the funds I put it into, and I never touch principle. My remaining bitcoin became and remain gravy and I plan on hodling until it doesn’t make sense anymore. My advice to all of you is to do your research, know your game plan for selling (I didn’t really have a solid one, honestly), be excellent to each other, and live that life. Ignore the noise – from nosy people in internet forums, from grouchy jealous jerkoffs, etc. This is your deal. 

I’m happy to answer any questions. Hope you found this interesting.",positive,0.8342988,3243

**edit**: Thanks for all the interest! I really love this community. 

Lots of good talk about taxes, yes they are thing, yes I know that, yes I’m prepared for it. It factors into my thinking. (I have a boating accident planned exactly 12 months from now!) (edit: surprisingly many people don’t recognize that’s a joke...)

More importantly though, the two biggest things that recently convinced me I just had to do this, and I want to share, are:

1) I bought something on Amazon with Bitcoin using https://paywithmoon.com/ and the process was as exciting as the first time I downloaded a song with Napster. (Edit edit: this is definitely not the company I work for btw, someone clever suggested that)

2) I also read the piece “Masters and Slaves of Money” by Robert Breedlove (https://breedlove22.medium.com/masters-and-slaves-of-money-255ecc93404f) and it finally clicked: if someone can manufacture something for nothing and then get you to exchange your life for that thing, then you are a slave.

525,2021-01-12,"Some honesty from a longtime hodler and Bitcoin fanboy.There are a lot of newbies entering the space. There are many reasons this is great news, but I've also noticed that the quality of posts and discussion about bitcoin has plummeted. We really aren't having the important discussions with nearly the frequency that we should. 

Now I know some of you won't like me saying this, but it really does need to be said. Someone needs to be realistic with our new friends and give them the bad news and tell them the things they don't want to hear. So here goes.

I feel that we're due for a correction, and I really don't think we've even gotten started. I've been around this rodeo a few times and it always -feels- different in the moment, but in reality it's mostly cyclical. In 2017/2018 we saw a months long sell off after the run up to 20k that saw Bitcoin fall to 4k. That's more than 75% in the red from the preceeding ATH. Refer to this figure later. 

I think we're going to see a few -15%'s, maybe even a -20% or -30% before we're really back in bear territory. When it comes I expect the new crowd to go through the same things I and many others went through when we were the new kids. 

Weak hands will get shaken out. People getting way over leveraged/exposed and taking out credit to buy BTC are going to be burned hard and maybe leave the space forever. Some will risk it all and put their house on the line, and nearly all of those will lose their home. People will buy into BTC expecting their investments to double overnight, everynight.

This shit happens every time. The vets come in to tell the new guys not to panic, or not get into serious debt chasing the bull run, and we get ignored. People will tell us we're trying to short, or how we might be causing this guy to miss out on SICK GAINZ by telling him not to take a second mortgage out to buy BTC. In reality, most of us really do care about the space, and want to see it grow. It hurt me every time I read about someone blowing years of their life away trying to chase the dragon at the end of the bull run. It hurts me more now to see it happening again, and the same arguments getting thrown about as justification for being reckless with their finances. 

Refer back to that -75% figure I dropped before. Would you rather that be the value of your house? Or would you rather it be the money you saved over time to buy ₿ responsibly? I made my own mistakes too, thankfully not with my house or something else vital to me, but mistakes nonetheless that put me in severe debt when I tried to chase BTC back in 2013. I only just now climbed out of that hole. (I literally made the last payment before posting this)

Bottom line is that BTC unfortunately attracts the get rich quick types, and when shit hits the fan they are NOT happy. They will panic sell to stop the bleeding. If you gamble your life savings on Bitcoin while it's at ATH because of FOMO, it's going to really hurt. 

The harsh truth of it is, if bitcoin is going gangbusters and you don't already own your position, you're too late for the bull run. Your best bet is to accumulate over time, so that in four years when we're looking at this situation again you can be the guy making five figures in his sleep, and making posts like these telling the new guys to have a longer term view.

I dunno, I just don't want to see people FOMO themselves into crippling debt like I did, and have heard so many horror stories about. It's the beginning of a very wild ride over the next couple of months.

EDIT: With this getting a lot more attention than I thought it would, I'd like to just say thank you to everyone for even giving this the time of day. I was initially replying to another comment on a different thread and the whole thing got a little long winded, leading me to just post this here instead. 

I just wanted to clarify a few things that I feel got left out or that I missed the mark on:

1. I am very bullish. I do not believe we're crashing imminently, but rather wanted to caution those getting sweaty palms of what could happen should they get too emotional and overextend while we're in uncharted territory. 

2. I don't think we're going to follow a picture prefect pattern of the previous bull runs. The price is entirely unpredictable, and if one could tell you with any certainty what the price or market sentiment would be at any given time they would have to be a time traveler. 

3. It is never too late to get into BTC. But you should temper your expectations when you're a late entry to the cycle. The 10x gains come later when you've held through a full cycle.",neutral,0.78848314,3211

528,2021-12-08,"There's a guy who the Space Force and Defense Department are paying $250k a year to go to MIT to study Bitcoin for them, to see how they could use its ledger in the same way they use GPS to store and track accurate immutable information. He just got permission to go public with his work.He's been talking about it for months on twitter spaces. Look up @ JasonPLowery on twitter to find his account. When looking up his background information, everything looks legit. This is probably what Biden's advisor meant when he said that his administration was mining Bitcoin, because from what I've heard this kid say in those twitter spaces, the stuff he's trying to do for them would involve mining and much more. His plan is to make Bitcoin the GPS and Atomic Clock of digital information, a solid accurate ledger to store important information away from things like internet rot or wiki edits.

For those who don't know, our current internet is rotting away. When you search on google, it claims to have billions of results for any subject, but when you search through those subject's results and actually dig through the pages, you only get on average around 350 to 470 links.

The other billions? They've been lost to internet rot, the result of links being lost or destroyed from things like servers going offline, losing the data of billions of results per search, the loss of things you used to be able to find online but can no longer locate.

This apparently is a problem for the government as a lot of those lost links were links used in actual court cases, leading to digital evidence being lost that in some cases have been used to set legal precedents. There's a lot more to what he's doing for the military via the usage of Bitcoin's immutable ledger, but this is what I can remember off the top of my head.

Hopefully he can set up an AMA with the mods one day. I bet this community would be very interested in hearing what he has to say in regards of what he's doing with using Bitcoin's immutable blockchain on the most powerful computer network on earth for the Space Force and the Defense Department's needs.

Sold it all this summer, 100% finished. 

Bought a house in a beautiful city in British Columbia. 

Big down payment, small mortgage and a basement suite to help us. Should be done in 5-10 years. 

Moving in with my fiance, one month to go.

Thank you BTC. I have security and a great life now. It's been a ride.

To all those still Hodling, I hope you get everything you want in life. 

Peace. 

Edit: Now that this has blown up, I will happily destroy it with the truth... I was high on Ayahausca and had a conversation with Pachamama. I promised to sell all my crypto as a sacrifice to the gods, and a demonstration of trust that the world will proivde everything I need. 

It will suck not being rich, but the house is a great blessing. 

I guess there's something else in store for me, that money can't buy. 

Peace.",positive,0.860123,3150
