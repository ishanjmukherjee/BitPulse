Low Mcap. It has a fully doxxed team. NOT A SHIT OR MEMECOIN. IT HAS ACTUAL UTILITY. Munch is building a charity launchpad to help make the world a better place. 

Rewards:  5% transaction costs shared over all holders, other 5% to charity. $3 million donated to [givewell.org](https://givewell.org) in its first month! Give to charity and make a passive income at the same time!profit It cannot be overstated how many media outlets will be covering, and how much of an impact it will have on the price.

The passive income is insane. Just from holding my Munch went from 73 billion to 85 billion in 3 weeks. Which is 7k at the time of writing (holy shit only just found out how much that is). If it does a 10x that is essentially 70k!

1,2021-05-14,"S W token profit $500k mcap price increase 2600 holders deflationary  CMC listing just approved bullish

This is a coin I am genuinely passionate about and have been in from near enough day one – the telegram community that has developed around it has to be one of the most tight knit I have experienced, and it is exciting that we are adding new members every day.  It has certainly been a rollercoaster journey so far and I am not promising a smooth journey, but I personally believe any investor getting in now will be very pleased long term.   

  

To summarise, I feel this coin, with such a low market cap and with the ambition the developers have shown, is primed to moon to the moon

  

The most exciting thing is that we found out yesterday that the coin was approved for Coin Market Cap listing price increaseprice increase(searchable and can be added to watch list). This has been a huge goal for the developers and anyone getting in before the listing goes live (once we hit the required daily volume and marketcap) we will be there for everyone to see. We also saw the price go x10 when we went live on Coin Gecko a few weeks ago and Coin Market Cap is much larger. 

  

We have also begun to see some real exposure with various youtubers covering us with many having over 100,000 subscribers. Here is one review: 

  

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xILwbCnMwA&pbjreload=101&ab_channel=CryptoPablo 

  

Highlights: 

*       879b total supply profit

  

*      $500k Marketcap 

  

*        121b burned so far trending

  

*      LP locked 

  

*      3600 holders ‍
  

*      Deflationary tokenomics 

  

*   1% burn rate trending

  

*   2% tax rate (used for expenses such as marketing) profit

  

*      Code Locked for safety of investors thumbs up

  

*      On poocoin’s new trending page 

  

*   Marketing campaign begun today (background)

 

*       Coin Gecko Listed price increase


*       1.8k telegram community 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Upcoming updates:

* Coin Market Cap listing APPROVED and live any day bullish

*  Detailed White Paper released by Monday 

* Revamped website by Monday 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So here is the roadmap: 

A 4-Year plan: 

  

2021: 

- Organic Growth 

- Marketing Campaign 

- Digital Marketplace 

- Community Platform 

  

2022: 

- A startup company 

- First summer party (aka meet the team) 

- First Project Election 

- First Project Purchase 

  

2023: 

- Investment tour 

- Our own exchange 

- Offices in multiple countries 

  

2024: 

- 1M+ Holders 

- 1B+ annual transactions 

- 10B+ Market cap

V2 on Pancake swap and Slippage at 5% 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A coin I have been in since the stealth launch which was ruined by whale & bot buyers and bad actors manufacturing a crash. We became a small community of core holders and have helped grow the coin since through spreading the word and holding strong with others seemed to not believe. The devs have worked tirelessly to deliver for the community and I firmly believe this has an extremely bright future and I can’t believe how early it is still. 

  

There was naturally some initial FUD spread by bad actors around the coin but the team have vastly addressed these issues and gone out of their way to appease the community with decreasing the tax and locking the code whilst also delivering some huge announcements.

Tired of always been late to a coin?

Tired of rug pulls?

Tired of seeing others x10 and x100 on their crypto whilst yours do nothing?
 
Price is going a bit mad right now due to a new video dropped so hard to pin down price and market cap (and holders for that matter)
 
Let me introduce you to  S W -  make your moneys worth, be smart.
 
+ 2150 holders
+ $260k market cap
+ 892 Total supply
+ 108b burned
+ Launched 26th April 2021
+ Deflationary
+ 1% burn rate
+ 1% reflection rate
+ 2% tax rate (lowered form 8% by devs after listening to the community)
+ LP locked until 2024
+ Coin Gecko listed
+ 2k active telegram group
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The coin itself has reached some amazing milestones already such as:

+ Achieving a coin gecko listing 2 days after application.

+ Being featured on a Turkish crypto channel with 120k subscribers

https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO6u7xYSULlrxfAWgjBOQJQ

+ Being featured on an English crypto channel with 100k + subscribers  
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8wXpVINhSENNMCiXYMAROg

+ Ran a trial banner ad campaign on coin gecko
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are many things to look forward to over the next week ALONE:
+ Imminent decision on Coin Market Cap listing application
+ A big marketing campaign starting on 14th May funded by the tax rate
+ White paper being released
+ Website revamp
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I found this coin randomly on a reddit post and have become fully involved in the telegram community and have never quite experienced such a tight knit group after such a short period. It was definitely a bumpy start with whales and bots buying up a lot of the coin after a soft launch and there being a dump by them from an all-time high market cap of $2.5 million. The community rebuilt from a lowly market cap of $7k as nothing had really changed but a few bad actors spreading FUD and the community has gone from strength to strength with the developers consistently surprising us by listening to our ideas and suggestions. I have been constantly adding to my amount after buying in a small amount when the token first took off and I personally see a big future. I am really excited about what the future holds for S W and it is evident from the people in the community that they really want it to grow and prosper. It still feels so early and at times feels like the best kept secret in crypto for me with only a market cap of $230k and holders at 2100. I regularly see meme coins with no utility or serious intentions hit market caps in the millions. It definitely has taken patience with this coin and mental steel holding through jumps to $600k + twice from coin gecko listing and other catalysts but what was promising to see was almost all the top wallets haven’t sold  throughout and are if anything adding.
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Long term there are plans such as:
 
+ Community decided purchases
+ Building own exchange
+ Social platform
You can read them in more detail on the website.

14,2021-07-31,"Cabread is offering a fully functional arcade with an NFT reward system.Catbread is a self staking deflationary token and the primary currency for the retro arcade of the same name that's just been launched. You buy tickets to play the games within the arcade at $.25 a ticket in Catbread. A scoreboard is shown below each game and the top 3 scores are awarded NFT prizes weekly. A more efficient award system will be implemented in the future to award frequent players as well. 

The current plan is to release a game every two weeks. Awards will be changed bi-monthly with a focus on hiring NFT artists from the community to complete Catbread exclusive NFTs. There's also an NFT viewer in development as well as a market place planned. 

AMA's are held on the official youtube channel once to twice a week to touch base with holders interested. The team is incredibly transparent with the wallet for the arcade fully disclosed. 

Highlights -

A simple retro game will be launched every two weeks while the the original game is developed. The platform will be opened soon for indie devs. 

Social media type structure planned. I.E feeds and trophy room for highscore NFTs. Audit soon. Asian market is being tapped now with a month long campaign App planned. Custom NFT viewer coming soon. Lead is doxxed and has AMA's weekly via youtube live. 

The beta is a FULLY functional arcade with a payment system. The only issues now are with iOS integration, but this is nearly fixed. There's only one game for now since the focus was on backend security and integration. 

An original IP with a story is in development currently using roguelike games, Ninja Gaidan and dungeon crawlers as inspiration. 

Project seeks to be a retro NFT/Crypto combination of Steam & Newgrounds. This means eventually becoming a publisher. 

WeChat campaign goes live as soon as they're finished with maintenance on verification services. Weibo campaign is live now. 

Publications are being turned out with articles already on Yahoo Finance and Business Insider. 

Short term roadmap is as follows -Catman
 -Asian marketing push -Mainpage overhaul and migration to arcade page servers - Galacat AUG 8th 
-full professional audit 
-Breadout 
-Catris 
-NFT viewer 
-Original IP -Mobile APP 

Base coin tokenomics: Each transaction has a 10% tax. Five percent of that tax is redistributed to holders. Five percent is sent to the liquidity 
pool. A very small percentage of both is sent to the burn wallet. These tokenomics were chosen because 10% seemed like a number that wasn't too impactful in regards to transactions yet large enough to add up significantly with added volume for redistribution and token growth via the liquidity pool. We also added a 1% supply cap for each wallet. This ensures that one person wouldn't control enough of a supply to negatively impact the price further down the road while still allowing a significant return. 

Arcade tokenomics: A transparent and trackable wallet collects funds that are deposited from ticket purchases. The beta's funds will go directly into liquidity at first to decrease volitility. The primary use of funds from the arcade will then shift into paying for artists, community events, development and marketing. 

Total Supply: 1,000,000,000,000,000 Total Burned: 423t 44.3% Amount in circulation: 576.5t+ Ownership is renounced. 2% has been allocated to raising market capital. 

The 3 original team members have disclosed they have a single max 1% wallet for personal profit each. 

APY has been swinging between 30% and 400%

‍Feed has partnered with Rachel Siegel (@CryptoFinally) to help spread the word about FEED's mission, FEED the World.

‍‍‍A new PR agency has been hired.

Marketing campaign with important Spanish-speaking influencers, to reach all of Latin America and Spain with FEED will begin. This is to make the FEED project known to the general public, as well as a more direct action to crypto investors. Who are they?

Reaching a total of 15.5 million followers on their social media profiles importantimportantimportantimportant

Again, on marketing campaigns, FEED will start a campaign with famous celebrities worldwide to spread the project around the world.

dataA new digital marketing and positioning agency has been hired to obtain an organic and real growth of its social networks.

Website will take a new shape soon. The team is trying to develop something eye-catching and more user friendly.

⏩Several solutions to make it easier to invest in FEED for people who are not used to investing in cryptocurrencies have been looked at. (working on it, people will be able to buy FEED with FIAT directly without all the intermediate steps).

Lastly, Feed is determined to team up with prestigious associations fighting against hunger.

These marketing plans only prove that Feed is a long-term project and they want to build a solid ecosystem while building its foundation. Whatsapp, YouTube, Tiktok, and other social media marketing campaigns are currently ongoing. The token is currently at a solid entry point ($0.0175 = $1.7million MC) That said, I see another bullish run. Let's make the most out of FEED’s good store of value.

The same way SafeMoon paved the way for thousands of other coins to introduce the redistribution to holders, EverRise is the first to introduce this BuyBack feature.

In the stock market environment, BuyBack means buying back the shares of a company in the open market, which increases the value of the stock. At EverRise, we chose to apply the Buyback concept to cryptocurrency, and make our token more attractive to hold.

On the EverRise protocol, a 6% transaction fee is stored in the contract and used periodicallly to buy back tokens from the market and then instantly burn them, increasing the value of the circulating supply.

The fees collected by the Contract are used to buyback and burn tokens when market conditions are bad, instantly increasing the price and saving the holders from massive dumps when is necessary.

Everrise is the first token to implement smart analytics and tactics to beat financial adversities on the blockchain through the use of the revolutionary Buyback feature.

The token holders are benefited also through a 2% static rewards.

EverRise is working on two dApps: EverOwn and EverLock. Those projects will solve problems on the crypto industry and will be a source of revenue for the project and the holders.

22,2024-06-26,"I’ve held POWSCHE for 82d 14h 22m - Here's my thoughtsMy POWSCHE Journey: Why I'm Still Confident Despite the Ups and Downs

I've been holding POWSCHE for 82 days, 14 hours, and 22 minutes as I write this post.

I've watched POWSCHE soar to an all-time high of a $28 million market cap and plunge to $1.9 million. Like anyone, I've had my doubts, especially in the unpredictable memecoin space with all its rug pulls and false promises. But something about POWSCHE keeps my faith strong, and here’s why:

**1. Trustworthy and Transparent Leadership:**  

The developer, who is incredibly active and open about his past experiences in crypto, marketing, and life in general, had over $3.5 million in his wallet during POWSCHE's peak but didn’t sell a thing. He's participated in numerous “Ask Me Anything” podcasts and video chats, openly sharing his vision for POWSCHE and its origins rooted in a love for Porsches. This transparency and commitment from him and other major holders (whales) who have refused to cash out even when they could have become millionaires, speak volumes.

**2. Strong Community Relationships:**  

The POWSCHE community is tightly knit. It's like a circle of close friends—if we could achieve something spectacular and make a lot of money together, why would anyone sell out their friends to be the only one with millions? This camaraderie is evident in the top 10% of holders and beyond. Together, we can achieve so much more. Even when POWSCHE hits billions, the plan is to DCA (dollar-cost average) out profits as needed, ensuring stability and longevity for the coin.

**3. Organised and Professional Team:**  

The leadership team is structured like a corporation, with heads of departments managing specific areas like memes, videos, and marketing. It’s refreshing to see this level of organisation. The team consists of experts in their fields who are knowledgeable in the crypto space and always ready to help and advise. If you haven’t already, check out POWSCHE’s podcast on YouTube or Spotify—it’s pretty amazing and different from anything else out there.
Read more here about the Podcast:

[POWSCHE Podcast - On The Cusp - Episode 5 out now](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/1dkzpo9/powsche_podcast_on_the_cusp_episode_5_out_now/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

**4. Exciting Real-World Initiatives:**  

I haven't even mentioned the Tesla and Lambo burns yet! Both events will be streamed live on Twitch for the world to see, which will undoubtedly attract more attention to POWSCHE. They also host numerous giveaways and have a referral program where you can earn POWSCHE. 
They’ve also announced Porsche giveaways to a lucky holder! Check out https://www.powsche.com/ for the full roadmap.

**5. Long-Term Vision:**  

I genuinely feel I’ve made a good decision with this investment. The memecoin space is highly competitive, but like any successful business, it's the ones that think outside the box, the innovators, the first movers (like the first car-themed memecoin) that truly make an impact and have longevity.

For all these reasons and more, I’m not worried. No more getting rugged or losing faith in the dev’s intentions. No more investing in generic cat or dog memecoins. None compare to POWSCHE’s dev, leadership team, and community.

Porsche, as a car brand, is recognisable, relatable, and aspirational, just like POWSCHE. I'm not chasing short-term gains; I want to be part of something that looks set to become a significant part of crypto history.

For just a couple of Solana, you could be involved too. My advice? Stop chasing pump-and-dump schemes for short-term gains. Get involved in something you can be truly proud of.

Buy POWSCHE now.   Sit back, Hold, Know you’re in safe hands.

[slamtoken.com](https://slamtoken.com/)

[https://t.me/SlamToken](https://t.me/SlamToken)

As one of the only tokens on **BSC** generating revenue, the current analysis on profit shared with Slam Token investors is as follows.  


Based on the value of the last dividend payment on September 19th (paid in BNB + Slam) vs the cost of 100M Slam, **current ROI is around 20% per year.**

That's the present valuation, not accounting for the increasing growth on payout amounts which have nearly doubled month on month.  


**BNB profit results since launch:**  


**Month 1 + 2 = 280**  

**Month 3 = 420**  

**Month 4 = 820**


&#x200B;

Regardless of crypto market movements, as long as people keep gambling, Slam investors will continue to receive their dividends.   


More partner tokens are being added weekly, so far including;  $CUMMIES, $NFTART, $YUMMY, $AQUAGOAT, $SHARK, $ASS, and $PITBULL. The profits from partnership tokens are converted into Slam and shared with Slam token investors.  


Next marketing phase is focused on ETH along with adding partnership tokens from the ETH network, while continuing to market and grow volume from BNB and BSC tokens.

&#x200B;

Currently, the above revenue is generated from their original Crash game:

With so many charity coins popping up, the good tends to be mixed up with the bad ones, and this is a GOOD one. The core team members, Sebastian and Martin, are some of the nicest people you'll talk to. Always available for a chat / voice chat and have already doxxed themselves via a team video.

The plans they have for the future are really promising and they are already a legal entity!

In my opinion, this is one of the safest investments you can make in the BSC right now and it will explode in any moment.

The Collective aims to bring you BSC's first decentralized freelancer marketplace. Imagine fiverr or etsy, but powered by crypto!The Collective is the future home of one of the first crypto decentralized freelance marketplaces bringing together artists, developers, marketers, and other providers of various products and services, while providing their prospective clients a safe and secure means to do business.

The Collective Coin is a community driven Defi coin and will be the official currency of The Collective. The coin will be the main currency on the marketplace.

Main features:

COMMUNITY-DRIVEN

We strive to maintain a strong community that supports and represents what The Collective stands for. At launch, there will be five separate developer wallets that will each hold 1%, for a total of 5% of the total supply. These wallets will help fund the development of the Collective Marketplace. The developers of The Collective will then participate with the public in purchasing of additional coins.

trendingBURN SYSTEM

After every trade occurs 5% of the transaction will be burned forever into a burn wallet that is locked away. This will decrease the total supply and increase the value of the coin.

AUTOMATIC LIQUiDITY POOL

After every trade occurs 5% contributes towards automatically generating liquidity that goes into multiple pools used by exchanges.

THE MARKETPLACE

Currently offering graphic design services in exchange for cryptocurrencies, the goal of The Collective is to create a decentralized marketplace, inspired by platforms such as Etsy and Fiverr, for other providers to also offer their products and services to clients in exchange for The Collective Coin, or virtually any established cryptocurrency of their choosing, for a small fee.

Providers will create a profile, and have the ability to establish a virtual storefront on the Marketplace, which will be accessible through a dApp from the user’s wallet.

Tokenomics:

Total Supply: 500,000,000,000,000 (500 Trillion) Supply after 50% Burn: 250,000,000,000,000 (250 Trillion) Private Community ICO: 8.4% (21.5 Trillion) 375B/BNB - 73 Wallets Dev Wallets: 5% (12.5 Trillion) 2.5 Trillion/per wallet - 5 Wallets Unicrypt Presale: 27% (135 Trillion) 300B/BNB Liquidity Locked One Year, locked for 3 more years: 79 Trillion

On April 2nd they released Limit orders on PancakeSwap, meaning anyone can place buy orders on any BNB coin pair in the BSC network! For now it is only limited to buy orders. Luke, the BogTools co-founder (fully doxxed!) announced that Sell Orders and Stop Loss Limits will be live in the next week.
How convenient is that?

They held an AMA yesterday, where they also announced two new partnerships: 

UniRocket Bots and WaterfallBots on telegram will be the sole provider of charts with links to charts.bogged.finance being added to every BSC trade post, reaching over 70,000 people in total. This will be launched in less than two days from now. 

Needless to say that this is all looking very bullish, they are still under 20 Million market cap, so plenty of space for growing from here. 
100 million market cap is more than attainable, as this is one of the most promising projects on the BSC. 

If you have any questions about this, feel free to ask, I’ll be more than happy to answer!

In the mean-time, you can always hit the telegram group, you will find one one of the nicest - comfiest communities around.  
I hope you won’t pass on this one, this is pretty much the last chance you have to buy at a low price!

Thanks!

32,2021-05-08,"bullish $PRT (Portion) - NFT Gem – Only 10m Marketcap – Marvel & DC Artists Involved - Mark Cuban! Hello there my fellow **NFTers**! I want to introduce you to Portion, one of the greatest NFT projects going. In my opinion, but you can base your own opinion after reading about it. :)

\- **Name**: Portion

\- **Symbol**: $PRT

\- **Blockchain**: UniSwap & BSC

\- **Total Supply**: 2.5 Billion (40% Burn on June 1st 2021)

\- **Marketcap**: $10 Million

 *What is Portion*?

Portion is the premier online marketplace connecting artists and collectors through Blockchain technology to easily sell, invest and own art and collectibles with complete transparency.

Portion allows anyone to be a collector. For the first time, manage your physical and digital collection in one place. Easily exchange crypto for art & collectibles on the Portion App!

The 21st Century Auction House for Rare, High-End NFT Art, Music and Collectibles!

 ***The Team***\*:\*

The Portion Team consists of 20 contributors and advisors, ranging from (previously) high-positioned members of Christies, Sotheby, HighSnobiety, JPMorgan Chase, Sirin Labs and many more (art and technology) institutions.

So it is safe to say that all of the team members have vast experience in the blockchain space as well as in the art industry. Furthermore, by actively recruiting fashion and technology experts and forming powerful partnerships with well-known brands and artists, the team is more than capable of building the global luxury marketplace as they envisioned from the start.

***bullish Market and Target Audience***:

Portion has an ambitious business model concept when it comes to the world of NFTs. Its main goal is to bridge the gap between two striving economic systems. For one you have the new and much talked about NFT projects popping up everywhere and on the other side you have the growing digitalization of the auction industry. In order to bridge the gap, Portion describes itself as “*the premier online marketplace connecting artists and collectors through blockchain technology*”. So far there hasn’t been any real differentiation of other NFT platforms, but if you look closer they have a distinct target audience, namely luxury art collectors and artists bidding and trading on a global Marketplace. An audience that pushed Christies’ yearly revenue beyond the ***$4 Billion Dollar mark***, while also pushing the evaluation of the art and collectibles economy to about $2,7 Trillion in Assets and increasing online sales by 262% racking up over $300 million in the year of 2020.

 ***Benefits & Updates***:

\- Yesterday on the 06/05/2021 a Portion piece got shared on **Mark Cubans** NFT page.

\- **Marvel** & **DC** Artists are involved and minting NFT's on Portion App.

\- Partnership with **Simplex**

\- Website app is fully functional with minimal to no latency.

\- New Portion Tokens are distributed when artists create new NFT’s, currently 500 PRT each.

\- A super open and reliable team, very vocal and no rug potential at all.

\- 40% Token supply to be burned June 1st 2021 trending

\- Easy 5x-10x potential!

35,2024-06-16,"My thoughts on $HEGE. Can we expect comparable growth to PONKE? I found $HEGE on Reddit last Wednesday while browsing and searching for something to buy. I joined their Telegram, and although it sounds cliché, their community is great. They welcomed me immediately, answered all my questions, and even apologized for the raid bot muting me. This is the first time I've seen a community this friendly and open.

**But what really makes $HEGE stand out, and why do I believe it is the next big memecoin?**

* **Distribution Better than 100M+ Coins**: If you compare the liquidity pool of $HEGE and the amount of tokens held by the top holder, you can clearly see that nobody has enough tokens to drain the entire LP. This is extremely rare for a 7M market cap memecoin.
* **Content**: This point is crucial because content quality distinguishes good memecoins from the rest. Compare $PONKE with $HEGE. Both coins have high-quality memes and animations with the same virality potential. And let's be honest, good content is what made $PONKE skyrocket.
* **Originality-** People want something new and fresh. And because there are thousands of dogs and cats but $HEGE is the first hedgehog inspired memecoin ever, we are exactly what they need.
* **CEX Listing**: We are getting listed on Toobit next week. Some might argue that this listing won't significantly impact us because Toobit isn't a major exchange, but you have to consider it from another perspective. It demonstrates the dedication and commitment of both the team, which secured the deal with Toobit, and our community, which donated money for listing and market-making fees.
* **$HEGE Academy**: This made me extremely happy when I first saw it. When I started with memecoins, I lost money on many rug pulls and was so frustrated that I wanted to quit. $HEGE Academy will make it much easier for everyone starting from scratch. It will teach you how to buy memecoins, use crypto apps, identify scams, and increase your chances of success in this space.
* **Growth during red market-** It is extremely hard for any altcoins to grow when the rest of the market is dumping but $HEGE community has once again proven its strength and helped with the recent pump through constant shilling on Reddit and Twitter.
* **Competitions-** Admin team organizes competitions quite often. You can win up to $350 for just creating memes, posts or other content used for promoting $HEGE.

Since $HEGE is only at 7M market cap, it is one of the most undervalued gems right now. If you buy $100 worth of $HEGE now, it could be worth over $1.4k at a 100M market cap, which is easily achievable in a proper bull run.

Everyone is welcome in our community, whether you're a holder or not. Join our Telegram to see for yourself what we are capable of and that I was not lying about anything.

**What is HOGL?**

HOGL (Hold On Good Luck) is a deflationary currency on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) with reduced fees thanks to BSC. Every time a transaction takes place with HOGL, 1% of that transaction is partially distributed to all wallet holders via autostaking and 1% is partially removed or “burned” from the total supply. This increases the scarcity and value of every HOGL in circulation. As more transactions take place in the network, the individual net-worth of all who own a piece of the network increases as well.

39,2021-04-06,"Welcome Martians , $MDAO is preparing it's Planetary HODL Defenses! Pre-sale goes live tonight! 

Pre-Sale Link: [https://unicrypt.network/amm/pancake/ilo/0x1b0C96D790871710C3279fF519dfd2a153DB7520](https://unicrypt.network/amm/pancake/ilo/0x1b0C96D790871710C3279fF519dfd2a153DB7520)

Brief Project Background:

While I'm not personally a part of the $MDAO team, I'll say that the team behind it has really impressed me so far. Originally, this project was coined $MAD. Unfortunately, the pre-sale and following launch turned out quite poorly when a good chunk of pre-sale participants sold within minutes of going live causing a cascade of sell-offs. This ultimately tainted the project from the get-go and all momentum was lost.

So, we took a community vote and decided to bite the bullet and come back for round 2, only much more prepared. The team has honestly blown me away personally with the transparency and drive that they have. With all that said, I think this project has some **major** potential. Please read below for all relevant details.

Martian DAO summary:

We aim to build a fun, engaging, community-driven project. Using tokenomics tried-and-true HODLers of $MDAO will take advantage of a frictionless farming token that employs 3 simple functions: Reflection + LP acquisition + Burn. For each trade, the transaction is taxed at an 8% fee, which is split 2 ways. 4% is redistributed to all existing holders, and 4% is split 50/50 half of which is sold by the contract into BNB, while the other half of the $MDAO tokens are paired automatically with the previously mentioned BNB and added as a liquidity pair on PancakeSwap.

Concept:

$MDAO is a themed-based crypto game, an experimental project with the goal of building a martian army. Every two weeks Martian DAO will release an exclusive pre-sale, which for the purposes of $MDAO will be called ""missions,"" for example our first mission after launch will be mobilization. The pre-sales rolled out by Martian DAO are designed to be fun but high-risk, high-reward projects. The goal of the projects are:

1. To build the martian community and strengthen our army for future missions
2. Raise capital to be used for BUYBACK and BURN events, team expansion and marketing. Some future plans also include a launchpad for the public to create their very own missions

3)Have fun and play smart. Take $MDAO to new galaxies

The roadmap will layout future goals and a whitepaper will come soon...

Whispers hint that the remarkable surge in MANTRA $OM on Binance, steadily increasing by 10-15% daily, could be attributed to an undisclosed partnership. Additional insights from the grapevine, such as an influencer's tweet suggesting MANTRA's involvement in bringing Real World Assets (RWA) to Cosmos, further fuel the speculation. Could a multitude of undisclosed partnerships be behind the 800% surge in price over the last 45 days? Uncertainty prevails, yet the rumor mill continues to spin.

47,2024-07-21,"[URGENT] DYOR on this Project Before it's too LateLadies and Gentlemen,

We went through a tough couple of weeks.

The recent events led to BTC dropping as low as **$53K**, causing **fear in the market** and many weak hands to either sell their entire holdings or scale down on their positions at the **worst possible occasion**.

https://preview.redd.it/zb3hafyajvdd1.jpg?width=963&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bea615499825787344eed404f90213cd2fa02847

  
Just as there couldn't be a worse moment to sell your beloved crypto, there wasn't a better time to get a position or top up your bags **at such a discount**.

 

When you have your eyes on **good projects with strong fundamentals**, you need to take calculated risks and buy the jeets' bags.

After only 5 days from a moment of ""**Extreme Fear**"", based on the ""**Fear and Greed Index**"", we're now back at a decent level of ""**Greed**"".

https://preview.redd.it/pmhj6nfcjvdd1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e42f279382b2fd59527fb383b61b37b8db6925f1

  
One of the ways to distinguish a good project from a less good one is to pay attention to **how the chart responds** when the market goes up after a dip.

Good projects with strong fundamentals have already **shown signs of a strong reversal**, gaining **50%**, **100%** or even more from the lowest point touched during the market crash.



One of those projects is certainly **$KENDU (Kendu Inu),** which went from as low as **$68M** back to almost **$150M** as soon as the market showed some strength.

 

That is an extremely bullish indicator to look for in a project.

https://preview.redd.it/h87d2ntdjvdd1.jpg?width=871&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2288fcc8d9531332c4aef39aacc4c862f4b10593

**COMMUNITY SENTIMENT**

Another important thing to look for is **how active the community is during a market crash**.

 

**Most ""projects"" go straight to zero or almost in this phase.** People in the TG group go silent, stop raiding, are sad, and eventually start looking around at the next shiny thing.

This never happens at **$KENDU**.

There is such a **big core group of OGs** who are always ready to **work and lead by example**. People coming to the Telegram group are always surprised by the warm welcome and the work ethic of the **$KENDU army**.

**The Kendu Inu community is more active during the dips than most communities are at ATHs.**

You want a **very active community** that is **always positive** about the project and ready to spread the word, especially when all the others around you are **too lazy and depressed** to do so.

https://preview.redd.it/cbf2wjpgjvdd1.jpg?width=1079&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6bb459e0141fb998c9ba991fd2e300793ff1b977

  
**COMMUNITY GROWTH**

**But how fast is this strong Kendu community growing?**

Well, let's look at the data. Data does not lie.

 

**The project launched on Feb 21st.**

**May 1st -->** **160** members of the subreddit - **1300** on-chain holders – listed on **1 CEX**

**Jun 1st --> 1345** members of the subreddit- **6000** on-chain holders – listed on **2 CEXs**

**July 19th -->** **3554** members of the subreddit – **12701** on-chain holders – listed on **14 CEXs**

https://preview.redd.it/ay6ubk5jjvdd1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=98f10c2f3a8d6be101230fe6095bc25a64c97007

**100% organic**, after a slow start, Kendu Inu has seen exponential growth in the last couple of months.

**Kendu Inu has a very strong floor** thanks to diamond-handed holders with a big vision, a beautiful chart, **holders count growing daily** and good supply distribution where nobody holds more than roughly **2%.**

 

**That is the result of a combination of:**

-            Fair launch

-            Organic growth

-            No supply to KOLs

-            No big influencers calling you from the start and letting jeets form the floor.

-            An army with an extreme work ethic

**SUPPORTED BY SHYTOSHI KUSAMA  - TOP 50 MOST INFLUENTIAL PEOPLE IN CRYPTO –**

**Shytoshi Kusama** was included in the list of the **top 50 most influential people in the whole crypto space** earlier this year, as he has a huge reputation and a **multi-billion dollar project** under his leadership.

He recently left an interview where he said his goal for **SHIB** is to reach **One trillion dollar** market cap ($1000b).

He would never risk any of that to support a project that is either a **scam** or a mere **pump and dump.**

As of today, Kusama has followed the page on X and joined the Telegram group to say hi and ask for details after **$KENDU** went from **$2.8M** to **$60M** market cap in just a few days.



He asked: ""**Why up so much? lol**""



It has also been confirmed that he has been holding a fat bag of **$KENDU** since at least **$1M** market cap.

Even though all details have yet to be revealed, it is known that **$KENDU** will play a role in the Shib ecosystem, which might explain Shytoshi's involvement in Kendu Inu.

Make no mistake, though, Miazaki has always said that **Kendu has its own identity** and will not just be one of the small dogs existing under the SHIB umbrella.

At the same time, being a partner of the 2^(nd) biggest meme coin that ever existed from such an early stage is an extraordinary achievement.

https://preview.redd.it/40n7n95rjvdd1.jpg?width=848&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=50b589b892f9d21e99e0c28b03f2118bdc922d41

  
**COINBASE LIKES THE STOCK**

News from last week: **Coinbase Wallet** showcased **Kendu Inu** in their new video ad (you can find it pinned on their X page)

**$KENDU** is the only meme project displayed there that is not in the multi-billions of market cap.



To be specific, these are the market caps of all the coins/tokens displayed in the video ad (at the time of the video being posted):

**KENDU**: $104 Million  
**USDC**: $33 Billion  
**SOL**: $66 Billion  
**BTC**: $1.2 Trillion  
**ETH**: $371 Billion  
**USDT**: $112 Billion  
**MATIC**: $5.0 Billion  
**PEPE**: $3.7 Billion



The second smallest meme **coin** in the video is $PEPE, which is sitting at $5.1b, about 40x from where $KENDU is right now.

**Read between the lines, people.**

The craziest thing about it all is that Dev said he had nothing to do with the Coinbase video ad.

He said ""I wish I could tell you I have buddies at Coinbase, but I don't. **That's because of you guys.**""

**Community-driven** projects focused on **organic growth** are the best.

**BULLISH ARTICLES**

**Cointelegraph article 1** --> **Kendu Inu — The one Inu that aims to rule them all** --> This article highlights the organic nature of Kendu Inu and its success in reaching new ATHs while the entire market was dipping.

 

**Shib Mag** --> **Kendu: The Wild Card That Could Reshape the Shiba Inu Universe** --> This article highlights that $KENDU is on a mission to forge its own identity and aims at revolutionizing the entire meme coin space.

 

**CMC article 1** --> **6 Best Altcoins to Buy Now** --> Coinmarketcap puts $KENDU as the n.1 altcoin to buy among the ones in the article.

 

**CMC article 2** --> **Top 4 Altcoins With Upward Breakout Potential** --> Coinmarketcap puts $KENDU as the n.2 altcoin with breakout potential, after KASPA.

**CryptoResearch** --> **Top 10 Gainers in June 2024** --> Kendu Inu takes the first spot as the #1 gainer for the month of June **(177.5%),** beating other fast-growing projects such as BRETT (**72.8%**), POPCAT (**57.3%**), and KASPA (**39%**).

**KENDU CHADS IS 99% COMPLETE**

Miazaki has always referred to Kendu as an **ecosystem**, it's always been part of the name of the TG group even. He says the **Kendu Inu Ecosystem** **will be the biggest in DeFi**, meaning there are big plans for Kendu in these coming months.

 

Kendu Inu's first **dAPP** is about to be released to the public.

**Kendu Chads** is not the final boss, it is only **the first piece of a big puzzle**.

Kendu Miazaki has left hints about what that may or may not be throughout the weeks.

 

**What we do know about Kendu Chads to date, is:**

* You need at least **5M** tokens to participate
* It is not staking
* You can earn **ETH** with it

 

There are no (and never will be) ""**sell the news**"" events at **Kendu Inu**. Therefore, details about Kendu will only be known once the **dApp** is out and ready to be used.

 

Even though Miazaki is an ""alpha vault"" (meaning he does not release info on the future on Kendu beforehand; he creates and then tells you what it is once it's done), he's hinted at the fact that **the goal is for Kendu to last for a long time, definitely more than a cycle**.

He once responded positively to a question from someone asking him if Kendu was supposed to maintain his value during a bear market.

https://preview.redd.it/s5ix9mfxjvdd1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b1d565ff999ee91ed8b967f58354113a219af522

  
**WHERE IS THE MARKET HEADED?**

It is clear that the cycle is, so far, repeating itself.

**There is no better entry than now** if you want to get into a project. Take a look at the picture below (right side) and see where we currently stand:

**On the final dip that usually precedes the start of the real bull run.**

We had the **BTC ETF** come out in January, and we have the **ETH ETF** going live just a few days from now.

**Rate cuts are planned for Q4**, and that, combined with the expected result of the **US elections**, should signal the start of the most fun part of the **bull run**.

There is going to be so much money flowing into the space.

Every project that is not a scam and has done well these past few months will inevitably do well in the coming bull run.

And when there is so much greed in the air that every shitcoin is in the green, what do you think is going to happen to such a strong project like [$KENDU](https://x.com/search?q=%24KENDU&src=cashtag_click)?

48,2021-04-02,"Toad.Network Is A Yield Farming Project With Real, Working Developers & Has Real, Working Uses[Toad.Network](https://Toad.Network) is a month-old BSC token that is bringing change to the yield farming sector.

TOAD decided to offer decentralized liquidity, releasing all liquidity to the community. This concept is called 'perpetual liquidity'. In exchange for returns, you forfeit a portion up front (10%) to farm LP. You are the guarantor for all other investors. This gives you the option to stake your TOAD/BNB LP tokens to earn additional LP tokens - a new concept in yield farming.

This is in addition to being able to stake TOAD as a single-asset or stake TOAD/BNB LP or TOAD/BUSD LP to earn TOAD (rather than earning LP). These farms do not require the 10% entrance/exit fee as the LP-earning farm does. You have many options of farming on [Toad.Network](https://Toad.Network) and they're just getting started!

**NOTE**: *Perpetual liquidity makes it so that the only scenario for a rug-pull is for ALL LP providers to pull their liquidity out simultaneously.*

This project has a great team working around the clock to make Toad Network the best yield farming platform around. They've designed a beautiful, easy-to-use website, and already have a token you can put to use, right now.

With the amount of copycats and scams being shilled in the BSC communities lately, this project is truly a breath of fresh air. It's currently around 1-2M marketcap, but due to the decentralized liquidity, you can purchase TOAD without impacting the price like you would other similar marketcap tokens.

50,2021-05-19,"Gradually and Then All-at-OnceSatoshi  Nakamato's masterwork hybridized technology, economics, and policy to   propose new scaffolding for society. Gradually, over ten years, its mystical allure has made its way from shadowy barstool discussions among   borderline-anarchists to the boardrooms of Fortune 100 companies and   the chambers of presidents and prime ministers. Now, we're approaching a   tipping point, a juncture where everything changes suddenly. I think   there's little that illustrates this more than the ""on-time""   materialization of [Beyond Protocol](https://beyond.link/), a stealth mode project with deep ties to Stanford University and   Silicon Valley. It caused a big stir on /CMS, being dubbed the ""[next top 3 coin](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/n94tle/the_next_top_3_coin/)"" and even provoked a rare philosophical discussion there about its role as a check [against dystopian AI](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/nb378m/beyond_protocol/). It's from sweeping, revolutionary technology like this the new world will take shape all-at-once.

By the way, I am a member of the project's Street Team, and I am happy to answer any questions you might have as best I can.

Here’s some more information:

* **Team** \- Stanford engineers, execs from IBM + Amazon + Qualcomm + Warner Bros
* **Tech**  \- Sophisticated DLT which eliminates hacks & allows Mega Apps to  be  built on any combination of devices (you thought the App Store was   cool?)
* **Market** \- More devices paying each other in future than humans. New era of AI/IOT/Industry 3.0 needs new security (the 2021, better version of [IOTA](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/iota/))

**Overview**

Beyond Protocol was started by Silicon Valley-based technologists in January 2018 to harness the explosive power of merging distributed ledger technology with IoT. Beyond Protocol eliminates hacks and facilitates  machine-to-machine value transfer.

With security as a given, Beyond Protocol allows us to feel comfortable opening up our devices for collaboration. Using them like threads of   yarn, the dreamers among us can weave together inventions we would have   not thought to conceive.

From the   smart phone -- a camera, a touch screen, GPS, an internet connection  --  applications were built which revolutionized entire industries (e.g. Uber and Instagram). From Beyond Protocol, mega applications can be engineered on top of any combination of IoT devices: from smart pills to   satellites. Imagine a Nest smoke alarm paying a drone to put out a fire, and the drone making micropayments to weather towers along the way   to determine the best route.

Beyond Protocol sets out to be the ethical language of machines.After over a   year of R&D, in early 2019, the Beyond Protocol team put forth the   first iterations of its novel technology to a handful of partners. The   technology allows its partners, with one line of code, to 1. enable secure message brokering between devices through hardware signatures 2. equip devices with a cryptocurrency-based payment gateway. At present,   there are no out-of-box solutions for either capability.Beyond seeks to   build real, practical solutions for device security and payments from consumers to devices, and soon, among an economy of devices. Beyond   envisions a future where good triumphs over evil and technology can work   to create an exponentially more safe and more beautiful world.

**We are still so early in the game.**

 

Not only is the cycle repeating itself, but we also have catalysts we didn't have in the past.

We had the **BTC ETF** come out on January, and we have the **ETH ETF** going live in just a few days from now.

**Rate cuts** are planned for **Q4,** and that, combined with the **US elections,** should signal the start of the most fun part of the bull run.

There is going to be so much money flowing into the space. **You jeets are not ready for what's coming.**

Every project that is not a scam and has done well these past few months will inevitably do well in the coming bull run.

 

Personally, **I'm all-in on $KENDU.**

https://preview.redd.it/e36amk2diccd1.png?width=580&format=png&auto=webp&s=0a1c23484e11721fa1ab551f7206bfe139b25fbb

I published a two-part post on r/memecoins about why you should have a fat bag of Kendu or get one ASAP, so I recommend you take a look.

**You don't have to be like me, but if you don't at least have some Kendu you're doing it wrong. Like you hate yourself or something...**

And flash news from less than 24h ago: **Coinbase Wallet** showcased **Kendu Inu** in their new video ad.

**$KENDU** is literally the only token displayed there that is not in the multi-billions of market cap.

The second smallest token is **$PEPE**, which is sitting at **$3.7b**, about **37x** from where **$KENDU** is at right now.

 

**Read between the lines, people.**

Something to add to that is we are in a nice period of consolidation and supply redistribution from whales to smaller holders.

The market cap is currently around **35-40%** of what it was at the **ATH** a few weeks back, and this is honestly a great entry.

 

To make money in crypto, you need to understand two things that took me forever to understand:

·        **What a good project is**

·        **Buy when everybody else is afraid to do it.**

 

https://preview.redd.it/m890yufliccd1.jpg?width=951&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cb8fca5a796a6d86c37b2564106106f6eedf56ba

**$KENDU is a good project in a space filled with shitcoins and rugpulls**. 

Now, you have the opportunity to buy or top up your bags at a great price that will most likely not last long.

**Smart people will.**

The others will have to deal with cope for a long, long time.

 

It is what it is.

56,2021-04-29,"RavenX - The charity token about to turn some heads.We need to have a chat. A serious one, there is a GEM of a crypto that is going to turn heads. There is so much going for it, and I am beyond bullish on it. 

The coin is called RavenX. It is barely 2 weeks old, has already been tweeted about by b\_i\_n\_a\_n\_c\_e charity when they hit $350,000 in donations. Well, just a few days later and RavenX is up to $700,000 in donations. 

To even have the attention of a major exchange after less than 2 weeks is amazing in itself. What else is unique about RavenX? Let me tell you:

1. Their donations go directly to the b\_i\_n\_a\_n\_c\_e charity address. No middle man, no potential to misuse funds that were to be sent to a charity. 

2. In the last 24 hours alone, over $200,000 was raised for charity. They are on pace to hit over a million in donations in under 3 weeks since the coin was launched.

3. Community – How great is the community? They had a poll asking if people would rather have more redistribution to holders or more for charity. Guess what they picked? More to charity. The positive outlook in chat is another reason I really like the crypto.

4. First exchange launch is today – if previous coin exchange launches have taught me anything, it is that the big jump happens days to a week after the initial launch. 

5. Tokenomics – 5% of every transaction goes **directly** to charity. If/when it hits 20 million a day in volume that will mean A MILLION DOLLARS A DAY GO TO CHARITY!!!! On top of that, there is a small amount of burn and redistribution (2 percent each). 

I have added a few links below. Their webpage gets dynamically updated so you can keep an eye on how much has been donated.

60,2024-06-25,"$HEGE is getting listed on 5 exchanges!! This might be your last chance to buy before 100M$HEGE has been launched 2,5 months ago and since then, it has been doing great. The growth we have seen in the last 2 weeks is extremely impressive considering the fact we achieved this organically. And it is not only the market cap we should look at, we gained new holders, followers, community members etc. So, let's take a look at the recent growth first.

**Market cap**

This flabbergasting pump started exactly 14 days ago when $HEGE was at 2,8M market cap. In the first week, $HEGE exploded for the first time and went to the new ATH of 11M. In the second week, we exploded again and went to new ATH again which is 30,8M and now we are sitting at 25M waiting for another pump that will most likely occur after our CEX listings.

**Holders**

We had 5100 holders exactly 14 days ago after our month consolidation. Obviously the mcap growth will be reflected in the amount of new holders. We have acquired 2500 new holders. This means we are up by 50% in terms of holders and have around 7250 holders rn.

**Socials growth**

Social networks like Twitter, Reddit, Instagram, Tiktok, etc. are often ignored and that is a terrible mistake. But $HEGE admins know that so they spent a lot of time and effort to build them in the last 2 weeks.

We gained over 5k Twitter followers, created a Tiktok account, started growing Instagram and reached nearly 800 reddit members. The most impresive is probably our Telegram channel that absolutely exploded in members and went from sub 3k to 5200 in just 14 days.

# CEX listings

But that's enough about our achievements, let's talk about the upcoming CEX listings. As you can tell from the title, we are getting listed on 5 exchanges. THAT'S RIGHT, 5!!! We got listed on SuperEX today for free and we are going to get listed on Toobit, Azbit and IndoEx later today.

You may be thinking rn, but that's only 4 exchanges? You are right, the best for last. Our admins and dev have made a deal with MEXC, the 11th biggest crypto exchange in the world with $1,5B daily volume. The fundraising with $120k goal started 2 days ago and we were already able to collect over $70k with one early buyer donating over $20k by himself. If we continue in the set trend, we should be able to get all the funds this week and get listed sometime next month.

This shows the faith of our community in this project, willing to send tens of thousands of dollars, because they know this is just the beginning and much more is coming.

The amount of listings we get in only 2 weeks period will catch attention of many people which is great but most importantly the attention of Tier 1 exchanges like Gate, HTX or Bybit and influencers that already started mentioning us after we skyrocketed.

Do not forget that we are only 2,5 months old so there is still plenty of room and time for future growth. I mentioned only the most important things in this post so if you want to find out more about our CEX listings or maybe about the various giveaways our team is holding every week, join our Telegram and become the real HEGEND!

I have already reported about #KeanuInu in other Reddit posts and want to give you an update on it. 

Finally KeanuInu is up on CoinGecko and Coinmarketcap!

It was rejected by a new logo and now finally the second review is through. Look for the coin on CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap and leave a like!

&#x200B;

BIG ANNOUCEMENT ON VOICECHAT BY DEVS IN 1 HOUR!!!!!! You are right before the big Gamechanger happens, come visit KeanuInu on telegram!

9pm BST

4pm EST

1pm PST  


[https://twitter.com/InuKeanu/status/1399424485372137479?s=19](https://twitter.com/InuKeanu/status/1399424485372137479?s=19)

&#x200B;

The big Bitcoin correction seems to be over and the Keanu Inu family has held together so well that we are still in a great position. The market cap went down to MCAP: 10 million dollars (since my last post that's 20 million less). There were few users who spread negative opinion, but were held back by the strong positive feedback from the community and with a HODL and other positive news, as well as prospects on the roadmap from selling at a loss. Losses that were recovered within a day. As of Monday 05/24/2021 we have raised the MCAP back to 20 million. Thanks to the whole Keanu Inu family.

UPDATE: 06/01/2021 MCAP of 28 Million, still super early, just loaded up my bags before the Big Annoucement!

&#x200B;

Outlook for the coming weeks:

&#x200B;

\- Chinese marketing team has been established and the website is being translated to Chinese.

&#x200B;

\- Chinese Exchange listing! (super bullish)

&#x200B;

\- Big Marketing Partnerships coming like WEALTH promotion (TikTok promotion tomorrow Wednesday!)

&#x200B;

\- Keanu Swap will be launched 

&#x200B;

\- Keanu Inu Merch will be available worldwide

&#x200B;

\- German Telegram group and many more languages are on fire 

&#x200B;

I have no doubt that this is going to be one of the biggest gainers in the next leg of dog season and probably before. As we continue to recover and rally, people are going to be turning to these coins, and with the community in full force and the team moving at full steam with this plan, along with the usual catalysts like CG and CMC, I think this is one of the best opportunities for massive gains.

You'll be able to talk to other trainers, trade, open Pokeballs containing random Pokemon NFTs, auction your Pokemons and ultimately battle other trainers. All on our NFT Marketplace/Social Hub, how exciting is that?!

These Pokeballs will be bought using the Charizard Token (CHZ006), all transactions made on the Social Hub will be made using CHZ006. Each transaction made using CHZ006 will burn 2% and redistribute 3% to all holders. This will result in an incentive to spread the use of CHZ006 as much as possible.

Already listed on Coinmarketcap and the Delta app, price tracking on CMC does not work yet, CMC is working on it and should be fixed soon.

The 3 Founder Charizard NFTs which are the first NFTs have been sold for:200K CHZ006 ($36K), 160K CHZ006 ($28.8K), and 150K CHZ006 ($27K), go Check it out:[https://charizardtoken.com/nft.php](https://charizardtoken.com/nft.php)

Prices across major exchanges including Binance, Bitfinex, FTX, Gemini, and Poloniex are posting around 22% gains over a 24-hour period. The cryptocurrency is currently changing hands for around $0.53. The increase came even as other major cryptocurrencies’ prices sank.

Meanwhile, U.S. cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase announced it would be adding DOGE to its suite of crypto offerings in six to eight weeks, likely due to client demand as has been the case with other major exchanges.

eToro said it’s adding Dogecointo the cryptocurrencies traded on its exchange due to client demand. eToro's 20 million users around the world will now be able to trade the Shiba Inu-represented crypto. It joins the likes of Kraken, Crypto.com, OKEx, and other [exchanges that list the cryptocurrency](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dogecoin#markets).

Gemini Exchange Users Can Now Earn Interest on Dogecoin. The Winklevoss brothers-founded cryptocurrency exchange, has added Dogecoin to the cryptocurrencies supported by its Earn lending program, allowing customers to earn interest on their holdings.

Users can realize as much as 2.25% annual percentage yield (APY) on DOGE, Gemini said in a [blog post](https://www.gemini.com/blog/earn-interest-on-doge-with-gemini-earn-which-now-holds-usd2b-in-assets) on Saturday. Under the program, users can earn between 1.26% and 7.75% APY.

66,2021-04-28," RavenX Just Surpassed 1,000 BNB Donated and is Currently Mooning!  

 whiteBIT listing goes LIVE TOMORROW, in conjunction with a MASSIVE marketing campaign! 

**Congratulations RavenX!!!! After just 12 days, the community has now donated OVER 1000 BNB TO BINANCE CHARITY!!!!!!**

This will change so many lives, and there is more to come!!

As volume increases, so does the donation amount. Right now, RavenX needs about a 9 million trading volume to reach the 1 million usd donation milestone!!!! (Assuming the price of BNB stays consistent)

Just 9 million trading volume!!!! That could easily be done in a day, given the right exposure.

This is all possible with RavenX's tokenomics - 5% of every transaction is automatically and transparently sent to the Binance Charities wallet (hard coded in the contract) in 100,000 RX to BNB chunks - you can see these sales on the blockchain. And yes, this causes a slight negative price impact, but remember 2% of each transaction is burned and 2% of each transaction is redistributed to the holders. This counteracts the negative price impact, while maximizing charity output.

The really cool thing - if something very unfortunate, like the dev team passes away, happens, RavenX will STILL be donating to Binance Charities, as long as trading volume exists.

What is more exciting - the future of RavenX is extremely promising!!!! Things to expect:

\-WHITEBIT LISTING THIS THURSDAY!!! (Yes, tomorrow!)

\-Certik Audit (ongoing) - to get listed on tier 1 exchanges (looking at you, Binance cool)

\-The $1 million milestone!!!! RavenX will be making some noise in the crypto community!

\-Tier 1 press release (i.e. Forbes article or something similar) upon the $1 million donation

\-Crypto news articles(ongoing - roughly 70 out already)

\-NFT Marketplace set to release in the near future!!!

\-Continual marketing - Including social media promotions, contests, and the whitebit listing agreement comes with paid marketing, etc.

Dont miss out on this gem, its ATH was sitting at 5 cents (a 24ish million mcap) and now it is around 2 cents (9 ish million mcap). There is much more room to grow here - I can totally see over 100 mil mcap short term (over 20 cents per RX)

-Shib og's are in it

-Kendu's dev is friends with the shib dev

-Organic community that doesn't gamble and works towards it by promoting it themselfs while diamond handing, they work for the coin as one and they don't depend on anyone else to do it. No one is coming to save them, They will save themselves by making it happen not relying on anyone else.

-No paid marketing that's going short us by buying bags pumping and dumping on us

-Dev is experienced and is handling it right with the extras on the side, work and sentiment.

-No exchange is paid to get our coin up, they come to us to buy their kendu and list it, They have to buy at market price if they want kendu. So far it's on 14x+ listing's if i'm not wrong (haven't been keeping up)

-I saw growth of holders even while the whole market is bleeding we're are 12k+ holders and still growing and holding strong. Despite the panic and fud in the market on crypto in general making all alts bleed.

-On june it was the top gainer by crypto research https://x.com/CryptoRResearch/status/1808513629815447683/photo/1 (competence proof that what KENDU is doing is working)

Great time to buy some kendu. If you DYOR right, there is just no reason why you shouldn't get in.

40-50b levels is cake play for kendu to make it as the sentiment is at 100B+ plus all the alpha in the background and new money coming in the crypto market.

Good luck in trying to find a coin that is better than it, there just isn't. This is as safe as it gets on a moon shot conviction play.

The same way SafeMoon paved the way for thousands of other coins to introduce redistribution and rewards to holders, EverRise is the first to introduce this BuyBack feature via smart contracts! 

A popular term and strategy used in the  stock market environment is when a company does a BuyBack approach which means buying back it own shares of a company in the open market. When implemented correctly this increases the value of the stock and investors holdings! EverRise, brilliantly applies the Buyback concept to cryptocurrency by implementing a burn concept of the token once buyback occurs! This creates a catalyst that increases the tokens value with the decrease of circulating supplies. 

On the EverRise protocol, a 6% transaction fee occurs that is stored within a contract and that is used periodicallly to buy back tokens from the market and then instantly burn them, increasing the value of the circulating supply. This contract has come to be known as the WHALE EATING KRAKEN!

The fees collected by the Contract are used to buyback and burn tokens when market conditions are bad, instantly increasing the price and saving the holders from massive dumps when is necessary.

The EverRise ""Kraken"" Strategic Reserves are deployed at specific moments to keep an uptrend going or break a downtrend. This is unique and a true revolution in the crypto world: a coin that can reverse downtrends, a big insurance for investors and long term holders. 

The developers use the smart contract (kraken) to prevent huge investors (whales) from joining and manipulating the EverRise market. As seen in multiple crypto projects huge investors can cause panic, down trends or up trends, manipulating the market in their favour while cause detrimental effects to smaller or new investors! Not with EverRise as it’s smart contract activates to provide insurance to all its investors and protection from pump and dumps! 

Everrise is the first token to implement smart analytics and tactics to beat financial adversities on the blockchain through the use of the revolutionary Buyback feature.

On the EverRise protocol, 2% 
fee is charged on all transactions (buy, sell, transfer) and is rewarded back to its holders. 

Also the EverRise protocol, has a 3% 
fee that is transferred to the marketing wallet. This is used for daily promotions of the token. 
Examples include:
 Daily of poo coin (25k), 
Crypto influencers (David Gokhshtein)
 TIME SQUARE BILLBOARD
profit Competition/Giveaways
 CertiK Audit (100k) 

The Main Developer for EverRises smart contract has decided to focus fully on the project and has given his 2 weeks notice for his day job to be able to dedicate all his time to working on two dApps: EverOwn and EverLock/EverSale. Those projects will solve problems on the crypto industry and will be a source of revenue for the project and the holders. 

 EverOwn 

Many new projects make the HUGE mistake of renouncing ownership of their contract to gain the communities trust. This can severely limit the growth of the project in the future because most exchanges require some minor tweaks in the contract as crypto grows. EverOwn is a Dapp EverRise is building that allows developers to temporarily renounce ownership of their contract by handing it over to the community. With EverOwn, the community can vote to hand the contract back to you to make the necessary adjustments! This is the perfect solution because it allows the developers to earn the communities trust without permanently renouncing the contract.

 EverLock 

EverLock is an additional Dapps EverRise is building to lock liquidity pools. There are major problems when liquidity is locked  and a unexpected growth occurs within the project! EverLock will allow with the permission of the community to unlock liquidity for cases like new exchange listings!

74,2021-05-09,"RavenX - The charity token that raised over $1,000,000 for charity in less than 26 days!Haven’t heard of RavenX? Let me fill you in a bit.

RavenX was launched less than 26 days ago and has a LOT going for it. First off, if you are reading this, you are likely a crypto investor. Here is what I like about RavenX from a crypto investor standpoint:

1. There are a lot of tokens with built in liquidity generation, redistribution, etc. RavenX has redistribution at 2 percent….but also has 5 percent of every buy and sell go directly to the charity wallet of a major exchange (I won’t name names because I don’t want my post to get auto-modded but you can figure that out fairly easily). No wait for charity disbursement to be manually done.
2. RavenX hit a million donated to charity with a 6.5 million dollar market cap. Yes, you read that right. RavenX has donated almost 1/6th of their market cap to charity in less than 26 days! Expect some news about that in the next few days.
3. Certik audit is underway
4. The developer has done several AMA sessions including a recent one with SAIL Veterans and does not shy away from difficult questions. Transcript of the SAIL AMA is available.
5. CMC and CoinGecko listings were complete within 2 days of launch
6. NFT marketplace – You can create, buy, or sell NFTs on the webpage

It is super early for RavenX and they have already accomplished some amazing things with much more to come.

75,2024-07-25,"[BULLISH] a CRAZY update from 48h ago

""I don't know if I should say it...maybe I'll say it and forget I said it.

Around **December/January**, Kendu is going to have a **major player** take some kind of position in Kendu, like a leadership position. **Someone very special**.

That's all I can say on that.""

 

These were the words of **Kendu Miazaki**, **$KENDU** dev, at the Dev Talk (X spaces) on 7/23.

What might have sounded like something interesting or kind of bullish, sounded **CRAZY** to me.

 

Why?

 

Only a couple of weeks before, I stumbled across a fresh new article published on Arabian Business, where someone was able to get an in-person interview with **$SHIB lead dev Shytoshi Kusama.**

https://preview.redd.it/ef95g80uxped1.jpg?width=731&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=44d6b5c57a1ccab5e35d7a2e9c5175545ed7f2ac

  
Why is that important? Take a look at the screenshot below:

https://preview.redd.it/k71ze7kvxped1.jpg?width=723&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3ceb3410de14a27f77149178aa42a5f4b9b30404

  
""**At the end of this year**, we (Shytoshi Kusama and Kaal Dhairya) will hand everything over to the community and **step away**.""

 

Nothing is confirmed. All you get is rumors until something actually happens. There is no ""**sell the news**"" event ever at Kendu Inu.

But this would explain so many things about **Kendu Inu's ties with Shiba and Shytoshi** himself.

https://preview.redd.it/chticyjxxped1.jpg?width=848&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=97caad815fd7a5b087c90308a4ca3d14fd6102f3

  


We're talking about the lead dev of the **2nd** **most successful meme coin ever created**, a person who has already made it once.

A person with **connections** everywhere in the space: **Binance, Coinbase, you name it**.

 

If this is what I think it is, I was right with my last Reddit post about Kendu Inu: **DYOR on this top-tier project BEFORE IT’S TOO LATE**. :D

In less than 2 weeks, the team and community have accomplished some incredible things:

- Donated over $500k to Binance Charity; completed transparent, automatic donation (no 3rd party, no team members handling the funds), AND Binance Charity is tweeting their support and thanks for the project. This is huge.

- Put their money where their mouth is; The team issued a community vote to determine transaction fees going forward. The community overwhelmingly chose to increase the donation to 5%, creating a fast track to $1M donated. With enough holders, a Binance listing is absolutely feasible. The team has the funds ready, they just need more investors to join!

- Whitebit listing goes LIVE on Thursday! Excellent time to buy before a big pop after listing.

- A MASSIVE marketing campaign to coincide with Whitebit listing 

- Grown to over 13k holders. This is increasing rapidly! The best news? The current Market Cap is ONLY $7.5M!!

Most people don't realize that the price of a token isn't what's important. It's the growth potential, because it's all about percentages. What happens if a coin has a $50B market cap and you own a trillion of these things? Nothing, in almost all cases. It's been tapped out. It's going to go dowwwwn before any growth!

This is not so with RavenX (RX). Why? Because the supply is sitting at just 430M. The market cap is only $7.5M. The current price is only $0.015. No, you're not gonna get 468 million gazillion coins. THAT DOESN'T MATTER. 

What matters is the viability to grow. And to 50x from a $7.5M market cap means the price of a coin will only need to reach $0.75. What does that mean for the market cap? It only needs to reach $375M. 

Yes. You heard me right. ONLY $375 MILLION TO 50X.

That's freaking pennies guys n gals.

And you don't need to drop a million to get there. Imagine how quickly this will happen if 100k are on board! It's almost unbelievable that more people havent jumped on this by now!!

Anyways, back to some accomplishments.

- 2 audits completed, and CERTIK audit has been ongoing! Should be done within a week.

- AMAZING new website coming. Trust me, it's gonna be fire.

- TONS of PR and published articles are out there...and many aren't even promoted! Just genuine news about a fantastic project making major strides. 

Trust me when I say, this team is FULL of action. FULL of motivation. And the community is INCREDIBLE. There is no BS around there, at all. 

I've looked into hundreds of ""projects"" and RavenX (RX) is the ONLY ONE that checks the block for both short term growth, longevity, and safety. This is the real deal!

80,2021-05-16,"Butter Token Raises $350,000 to End Hunger as Part of a Revolutionary Charity MovementA cryptocurrency charity raised over $350,000 in just 14 days for charities working to end hunger.

Butter Token, a revolutionary new token on the Binance network, is changing the way cryptocurrency investors are thinking about charity. May 14’s $354,000 donation is Butter Token’s largest contribution to food charities to date, following a $6,311 donation on May 1st. In total, the token has raised over $375,000 since it’s launch on 4/4/21.

The token works by utilizing a fee on every transaction. A portion of that fee is sent to the “Charity Wallet” where investors can then vote on which charity receives the funds. A percentage of every donation goes to Butter Token’s partner charity, Food for Life Global, and the remainder of the funds are donated to the winning charity. Today, Beast Philanthropy received $300,000 and Food for Life Global received $54,000, which will provide more than 500,000 meals to hungry children. “This donation will help us distribute an excess 300,000 meals”, says Darren Margolias the Executive Director at Beast Philanthropy.

The creator of Butter token, Christian Claypool says Butter and its companion, Milk Token, are still in the early “start-up stage”, but says the token is starting to gain recognition even outside of cryptocurrency spaces. He’s looking forward to seeing the impact the token has on the effort to end hunger as it continues to grow. “I'm proud of the fact that we are able to generate so much funding for charity at such a low MCAP. For example, the last donation of $360,000 came from Butter at a $6m MCAP. If Butter had the same MCAP as Milk at the time, our donation would have been over $1 million,” he said. Paul Turner, CEO of Food For Life Global agrees, saying, “the proof of this is the sheer amount of money they have already donated to hunger relief charities like [ours], far exceeding other tokens with much larger market cap.”

News from this week:
• Donation of $305k to Beast Philanthropy and Food For Life Global

• $Milk Trending on Coin Market Cap 

• $Butter listed on [CMC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/butter-token/)

• Both mooning with major growth bullish

• $Milk and $Butter now listed on Coingecko! (Milk’s chart is currently glitched on coingecko and team is communicating with them to get it fixed)

• $Milk tracked on [Coinbase ](https://www.coinbase.com/price/milk-token) 

• $Butter tracked on [Coinbase ](https://www.coinbase.com/price/butter-token)

$Butter: https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/butter-token


Milk and Butter tokens, for those that haven’t heard, are companion tokens in the Binance Smart Chain with an emphasis on charity giving. Milk is an RFI token that can be staked to generate Butter, which is used to power community voting for their favorite charities on a weekly basis. Those that merely wish to vote may purchase Butter tokens on the open market as well, which also drives rewards for those that stake Milk! 
https://www.milktoken.net/voting.html

5% of all Butter transactions are guaranteed to go to a charity wallet. In addition, Butter can be used to suggest new charities.
https://www.milktoken.net/suggest.html

$25,000 has been donated to charity so far, at a market cap of only 800K. We made crypto history when Butter became the first BEP-20 token to partner with a major food charity: Food For Life Global  https://ffl.org/20077/cryptocurrency-butter-token/

The liquidity for both the Milk and Butter tokens is locked away until 2022, at which point both will be relocked. Our Market cap is still low with a solid base, we're building our community for healthy growth, and we’ll continue to develop this project with many exciting use cases plus a full array of features to be rolled out as development completes.

Each week the Milk and Butter token team hosts AMAs with the Developer on Twitch where the community can ask any questions they may have. Occasionally, we have guests, last week the CEO of “Food For Life Global” joined us and explained the amazing genesis of “Food for Life Global” and took viewer questions. Our AMA’s stream every Sunday at 3am UTC [here.](https://www.twitch.tv/milkbuttertoken)

Roadmap: 
• Next week gamification of Butter begins with lotto/bingo games being implemented.

• The voting and staking processes will continue to be refined to make the experience as easy and accessible as possible.

• Planned instructional content to help those new to crypto learn about the space and how to purchase and use the Milk and Butter tokens.

• Additional exchange listings


Accomplishments so far: 
• Code built from the ground up to develop both tokens.

• Unique staking and voting systems implemented.
$25,000 donated to various charities in the first month.

• Official global charity partnership with “Food For Life Global” being the first of many. 

• Milk has been [audited](https://dessertswap.finance/audits/Milk%20Token%20BEP-20%20Audit%206361622.pdf) with Butter audit on the way

• The developer is [doxxed ](https://christianclaypool.wordpress.com/about/)

• Milk and Butter LLC is established with full team being doxxed [here.](https://www.milktoken.net/#team)

83,2021-05-11,"Banano and the founder of DogeDear altcoiners!

Some meme coins are original - most are not. Seeing a creation date of 2021 probably gives you a clue for  what you\`re up for.

Banano was created april 1st, 2018. The project along with the community has been built for three years and it resembles the early days of doge - even btc. Monkeys create memes, tip each other off and nothing else matters. It has a use case besides holding onto it and hoping for a greater fool to buy you out. Banano is also one of the top contributors to folding@home (medical research).

The reason for this post is the following: [https://www.reddit.com/r/banano/comments/n9oz27/creator\_of\_dogecoin\_here\_was\_told\_to\_check\_this/](https://www.reddit.com/r/banano/comments/n9oz27/creator_of_dogecoin_here_was_told_to_check_this/)

In other words, Banano has and always will be a true meme coin, second only to Doge. Its not about the price, but rather the fun and wholesome community.

Coingecko: [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/banano](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/banano)

84,2021-05-03,"$STRIKE - Could this possibly be the next low market cap gem on BSC? - Fuel for a Trading Platform in R&D stage (TradeStrike)Hey guys, this is a new token named StrikeCoin ($STRIKE). It has been released recently and the team behind it are developing a blockchain powered Trading/Investment platform called TradeStrike. The unique selling point of this token means there is a huge ceiling for the value to rise, imagine thousands of asset-based transactions a day and ALL of them processed via Strike! Think about the value of BNB now to compare it to;

A blockchain powered brokerage will allow for tokenisation of ALL assets, including; Stocks, Crypto, NFT’s and even real estate. Expansion into brokerages that offer multiple different equities is the natural next step.

There is a high demand for a fair and ethical trading platform, as online trading platforms are experiencing exponential growth and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. Below are some key points with the strides STRIKE has made in the early stages. The coin is listed on CMC so it has a backbone to it and they developers have received an offer from WhiteBit, for which they are currently fundraising for.

Key Points of Strike:

\* 900m Supply, 101m coins burnt trending , 249m time-locked

\* 73.4% liquidity locked

\* Great Supply Structure

\* Growing community, cheap and low market cap

\* 3200+ holders

Strike is listed on:

CoinMarketCap

Coinbase

\\-They have been audited by SolidityFinance with an extremely positive result  (see below)

\* The project is in the early R&D phase - Active roadmap available on their website (http://www.strikecoin.co/)

\* High demand for a reliable application with lack of competitors/alternatives

\* Determined, disciplined & transparent team actively available to be reached through discord/twitter.

\* TradeStrike platform will seek community input and feedback throughout development and ongoing after launch

\* Discord and telegram groups are non spam; actual discussions, informative and always helpful and the devs are always active in there.

\* Updated Whitepaper (see below)

Competitors:

The number of available brokerages in the UK is extremely limited. The main competitors are Trading212, IBKR, eToro. As many have seen there are complaints about all of these trading platforms.

T212 - restricting OTC buys, slow execution, no afterhours

IBKR - UI & app not user-friendly

eToro - no OTC stocks, slow execution, no AH

Users are seen to be continuously complaining about wanting to leave these platforms but cannot do so because of the lack of options. This can be seen throughout social media, app store reviews and communities.

Recent news:

86,2024-06-22,"Honest rating of memecoins pt. 5 ($HEGE)I came across $HEGE few days ago and after joining their Telegram I had to ape in and I am glad I did because it went up by 100% in the last 3 days despite the fact whole market is red and Solana is at $130. But this is just a beginning and a lot more is coming.

**But first, let's take a look at our growth and achievements in the past 7 days:**

**Market cap-** 6M **** 16M

**Holders-** 5800  6800

**X followers-** 6400  7400

**Telegram members-** 4300  4800

**1M all-time total impressions on X**

**15k donated to the CEX fees wallet**

You see? This shows that this is a real growth caused by the hard work of devs and community.

**But we all buy memecoins based mainly on their future, not their past, so let me just quickly tell you what's coming up and what I like about this project:**

**CEX listings and marketing push-** We are getting listed on 3 CEXs on Tuesday 25th. So from next week, you can easily buy $HEGE from an exchange anywhere in the world, including the US & EU! To help new investors find us, devs are developing a detailed marketing push for the day of listing.

**Competitions and giveaways-** Giveaways are common in memecoin space but $HEGE is a whole different story. Have you ever seen a community member give someone 7k? 7k dollars, not tokens!! Dev also held some giveaways and competitions so the total value of tokes distributed last week was $10k! And there are new ones coming this weekend.

* **Reddit competitions**- You can win up to 30k tokens ($400) for making reddit posts.

* **Twitter giveaway**- $500 will be distributed between 5 lucky people.

* **Tiktok competition**- Rules and prizes will be announced this weekend.

* **Raid to earn**- There are twitter raids happening every day. Most active people will be rewarded with tokens.

**More partnerships coming-** Big people from memecoin industry are starting to notice us. We have been mentioned by Rodney, CryptosRUs, Moneybags Rico and many more. We have also appeared in many big spaces of crypto influencers and other memecoin. That opens the door to bigger people, companies and CEXs. Dev is already cooking something, we don't know what it is yet, but I'm sure it will be HUUUUGE.

**Community commitments-**  

**J C:** ""IF WE HIT 20M THIS WEEK I WILL BUY AN ARIEAL AD FOR A PLANE TO FLY OVER THE HOLLYWOOD SIGN SAYING: SOLANA SUMMER - BUY $HEGE"" 

**Dutch1214:** “If hege reaches 10mil MC within a month i will tatto hege also LOL”

If you're searching subreddits for the next big coin of this bull run, stop and join the $HEGE FUND on Solana. And if you still do not feel convinced to buy $HEGE after reading this, join our tg or go through our website or Twitter to see for yourself. I can guarantee you will FOMO in after 5 minutes.

&#x200B;

* Reached an 80 million MC in 3 days
* Safest Token in Crypto with two audits
* Doxed Devs
* 40k + holders
* Billboard in Times Square
* Yada Yada

&#x200B;

Then the market crashed. People were scared to invest and most coins that launched at the same time completely disappeared.  Either they were scam coins that only ever planned on being around for a week or two, or the devs gave up and the community lost interest. **But that never happened with Ultra.** Ultra never stopped. The Devs have never stopped working on their goal of creating a project whose main purpose is providing **safety & security** \- to a place that's notorious for scams of all sorts - and the community never gave up. So if you haven't been keeping up with Ultra, here's what we've been up to:

&#x200B;

* Staking - out now
* Partnership with UFC Legends Rashad Evans, Daniel Cormier, & and more to come...
* NFT Marketplace - coming soon
* Completely revamped Website - out in 2-3 weeks
* Partnership with Crypto Titan **Zatoshi**, with an ultimate goal of moving to **our own blockchain**, **Ultra Protocol**

&#x200B;

Now is the perfect time to join the UltraFam, but as with all crypto, don't take any one else's word for it, DYOR. Check out our chart for the past week - it speaks for itself. That's organic growth that's only going way **up** from here. If you have any questions, join the Ultrasafe reddit or **Telegram**.

Last week in India, more than 350,000 COVID cases were reported in 24 hours - that’s 2 million cases a week. The situation in India is critical : 1 person is dying every 4 minutes in Delhi. Oxygen supplies are critically low, resulting in many hospitals turning patients away. The death rate has spiked as cases continue to rise. 

What’s going on in India is it ok. We keep those who have lost their loves ones and those in need, in our thoughts and prayers, and we will support them any way we can.

90,2021-05-14,"Hbar value propositionThank you to the moderators for featuring Hbar! In this post I plan to lay out a solid value proposition for Hbar, the native crypto currency to the Hedera network. To start, the Hedera network is currently one of the most utilized DLT’s in the space, and is growing at an alarming pace. This is mainly due to what I believe to be the most outstanding feature of the hashgraph network: HCS(Hedera consensus service). HCS leverages the rock solid, blazing fast, aBFT hashgraph consensus algorithm. In simple terms HCS takes DLT to a whole new level, instead of just crypto transfers or smart contracts, HCS can literally apply distributed consensus to anything, and I mean anything, and after you’ve thought about what it can do, it can do more. Some prime examples: everywhereUK is a medical company who built a system to guarantee vaccines are being stored and handled properly through clever distribution of sensors, they use HCS to accomplish this. IBM announced official collaboration with Hedera and it consensus service to ratchet up speed, security and scalability of hyperledger. The coupon bureau developed a new US standard for coupons, standard 8112, digital coupons, built with HCS as the foundation. Last one(my personal favorite) EFTPOS(Australian debit operator) utilizing HCS for settlements. There are numerous examples of HCS being applied everywhere and could go on for hours, but I want to focus on why this is so ground breaking. HCS is not looking to uproot the system and replace it, HCS is designed to reduce friction and barrier to entry, and will help enterprises be competitive. If you think retail FOMO is bad, think about multi billion dollar ceo FOMO losing profits because they’re being out competed by someone else using HCS, the coupon bureau said this is already happening with digital coupons LOL. So what, these guys don’t care about me, they only care about the bottom line! Exactly! Self interest will push them to HCS. if they all use HCS what’s the point of Hbar? HCS needs Hbar to run! It is the fuel for HCS. This is where the filthy Hbarbarian comes into play, the Hbarbarian knows this and holds Hbar for when the day comes enterprises are consuming Hbar at an alarming pace, and Hbar explodes due to enterprise demand. Thank you for your time, this post is nowhere near exhaustively describes Hedera, but gives the reader a taste, happy HODLing

[CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/feed-token)

One of the projects I am most bullish on, as far as charity coins go, is FEED.

After joining the community and getting to know the devs, I was impressed by their level of professionalism. They are treating this like the serious project that it is, work on it full-time from an office, and are involved hands-on with the donation, not just through sending money to charities, but by **actually going to the field and handing donations to the beneficiaries and distributing food**.

What should you expect when checking out feed ?

* Two contract audits BEFORE presale (by TechRate and SolidityFinance).
* Renounced ownership
* Locked liquidity
* Listed on Coingecko (only the 9th day after launch !)
* Doxxed team from Argentina
* The founders held AMA's and showed their faces and identities in several videos.
* First donation already made
* Four donations in the pipeline, to soup kitchens in Argentina, the UK, India, and a fourth country chosen by the FEED community
* Today they are releasing a video of the full team and their office.
* Professional and user-friendly website translated into several languages.
* A strong community that is backing the project, and are holding this token, which allowed its steady rise to a marketcap of 3 million dollars after the launch.
* Tokenomics

1. 3% of every transaction redistributed to holders, 2% added to the liquidity
2. 5% charity wallet, fully accounted for, with which one donation has been already been made.

Furthermore, Martin and Sebastian, the main devs, are always present on TG/Discord, and are ready to engage in chat or voice chat with anyone who wants to learn more about the project. They held many AMA's with the community on twitch, and will be doing more.

\~\~\~\~\~

Don't take my word for it, and always **D**o **Y**our **O**wn **R**esearch before investing in any project. That is why I recommend you check out the website, join the Telegram group, and get to know Martin, Sebastian, the rest of the team (comprised of 12 member), and the awesome community that is supporting this project.

94,2021-04-10,"LifeLine Token $LLT shows the world that DeFi cares. Charity tokens will drive mass adoptionWhat do day traders do?

I don’t mean like, what is our day-to-day (which is essentially like being in the wild rotating between predator and prey), but what is our actual function in society?

Some economists argue that our job is to fuel small businesses and prop good ideas up creating volume and attention and inevitably raising the capital in the product. But does buying a bunch of tokens and then dumping them on new investors really create social good? If you don’t hold the tokens for more than a day, did you really help the business?

To which, ya know, who really cares, that’s not what you came to a moonshots forum for. But people outside of our bubble care. Regulators care. Voters care. Investors care. Eventually, for the entire system to grow, we’re going to have to prove that what gets created out here is more than just a bunch of shitcoins in a shit ecosystem creating a complete shitstorm.

**LifeLine Token** provides an opportunity to have your cake and eat it too. With an initial 5% charity wallet that gets fed from transaction fees, LifeLine **makes** **monthly donations to causes combating children’s cancer**, the first of which has already gone out to [Alex’s Lemonade](https://www.alexslemonade.org/). That’s right, now we can day trade and virtue signal at the same time.

So once you’re finished feeling good about your karma, it would be a good time to remember that **Grumpy Cat went from $5M - $50M in a single day**. This all after news started pouring out about a silly meme with a heart of gold that managed to very quickly send out $70,000 to charity. Luckily, unlike Grumpy Cat, Lifeline isn’t going to be facing any copyright issues and is ready to scale for the future rather than plan a short stay in relevancy.

With that the team has already shown great dedication in engaging with their community and delivering on their roadmap. For a project that’s only two weeks old, it’s incredible to see them already **listed on CoinMarketCap**. As a **BSC token with a fully diluted market cap under $13M** you just don’t see that a lot.

And if you’re worried about rugs because, ya know, BSC, and the irony of being taken by a charity token is too much for you, there’s no need to worry. The contract is available for you to review and has had an audit completed by TechRate so there’s no nonsense mint functions, and **all liquidity has been burned**. There's even an **anti-dump feature** in place that prevents any wallet from selling more than 1% of the total circulating supply at any time so you don't have to worry about a single whale dominating the market.

The only thing that could be rugged is the charity wallet itself, but it started at a 5% share of tokens so it’s nothing worth writing home about for a team of their size, and they’re looking into finding a third-party custodian anyway in order to keep public trust high.

With the whitepaper coming soon and a ton of marketing still on the way as they get every detail in place for a big push, know that you’re still early to what is a unique cause in a growing space. Just as we see thousands of charity organizations thriving in traditional finance, know that this is only the beginning in DeFi as people find new ways to skim margins off day traders for the good of society. Because, fair or not, society will be coming demanding to see the easy-to-digest fruits of our labor. LifeLine is definitely going to be a good start.

97,2024-06-19,"Will HEGE join the Billionaire boys club? **What is $HEGE?**

Let's keep this short. $HEGE is a Solana coin launched back in April. It was created by a professional animator who was tired of losing money. This is why it outperforms 99,9% of coins in terms of high quality content. During these 2 months, we gained over 4,5k community members and over 6k holders. We created a strong base of our community with people from all walks of life. With a wide range of opinions from different people we are able to progress quickly. 

**What we have achieved so far**

So as I already said, we have 4,5k tg members with 30% increase in the last 2 weeks, 6000+ holders with 1000 new holders in the last 7 days. Our Twitter went from 3k to over 6k followers in just 1 week. We are gaining traction everywhere and our recent growth only confirms my statement. Our market cap was only 3M last Tuesday. Yesterday, we reached the new ATH which is now at 9,5M. Current market cap consolidates between 7M and 8M. We have also been invited and appeared in various crypto spaces of crypto influencers and other coins.

**What makes us stand out?**

Well, I don't even know where to start :D. First of all, our content and memes. It is hard to find a coin with no AI pictures but it is one of our rules. We do not want to post AI content, we want to do it all ourselves and make sure everything is high quality and exactly how we want it. Good and high quality memes are crucial to make it to the 100M club and to stay there. Second thing is a bit cliché but it is true. It's our community. I have bought a lot of coins in my life but I have never seen a community this active at only 8M market cap. They are constantly hyping each other, helping with everything and creating an insane vibe I absolutely love. This shows that we all believe in this project and that we are ready to bring it much higher than where it is right now.

**Future plans and outlooks**

It may look like we've already used all our tricks, but the opposite is true. This all was just the result of constant shilling, raiding and working for our bags in general. The real show starts now. We will appear in a huuuge space of a crypto influencer with 500k followers today, our first CEX listing is coming next week, HEGE Academy and much more content are in the process of making.

If you still do not feel convinced to buy $HEGE after reading this, join our tg or go through our website or Twitter to see for yourself. You can also listen to some of the previous spaces or join today's held by Travladd Crypto, crypto influencer with 500k followers. If you want to find out more, ask questions and I will try to answer them :).

**1)  SHYTOSHI KUSAMA INVOLVED**

**Shiba Inu lead Dev Shytoshi Kusama**, considered among the **top 50** most influential people in the whole crypto space, is confirmed to be following Kendu Inu and holding a bag since at least $1M market cap.

**Kendu Miazaki**, Kendu Inu Dev, is one of his friends, and he made sure to bring Shy in at the right time.

 

 

**2)  HUGE WALLETS APING (MULTIMILLIONAIRES)**

Wallets with **10+ million dollars' worth of ETH** that had been inactive since the last cycle got back to life only to buy Kendu Inu.

It has even been confirmed that a **Middle Eastern Prince** holds a bag.

Other millionaires (and multimillionaires) are confirmed holders and part of the ecosystem as well.

 

 

**3)  KENDU MIAZAKI**

Kendu Inu Dev ""**Miazaki**"" is an unhinged individual always ready to rock & roll.

He is a **SHIB multimillionaire** (his bag was worth 50+ million dollars at ATH IIRC), and that explains the close connection with **Shytoshi** and other **SHIB Ogs** that are now part of Kendu.

Apart from his **incredible work ethic** and **crazy personality**, him being a loaded individual makes the project much easier to trust because one of the most common reasons for projects to fail is broke millionaire-wannabe devs who can't resist the urge of dumping on everybody to make a quick buck.

He recently admitted on a X Spaces that he doesn't even have that big of a bag. He said ""**I’m maybe top 20, if even that**”.

He always says he does not do this for money because he already has money. He does this because he likes to “**build**”  and to allow other common people to become “**stupid rich**”.

 

 

**4)  COMMUNITY**

What can I even say about the **Kendu Army**? Everybody knows about it.

With unmatched work ethic and always ready to spread the word, the Kendu Army is what makes Kendu…**KENDU**!

People who join Kendu go from being dirty, tiny-handed jeets to 7.6ft tall, muscular chads with strong and big hands.

You’re soon taught that success depends on you and to ask yourself, “**What can I do for $KENDU?**” instead of waiting for the team to release the “**next big thing**” and hoping for a pump while doing absolutely nothing to help.

**We’ve got relentless shillers** on any social media known to humanity, people making Kendu **energy drinks**, people managing a Kendu **merch store**, people with Kendu **tattoos**, people smashing plates on their heads in the name of Kendu, and much more.

 

 

https://preview.redd.it/yj18zclypcad1.png?width=606&format=png&auto=webp&s=5cc6f00a283f679392bf8bf5a874e7767a353358



**5)  ORGANIC GROWTH**

Kendu Inu fully believes in organic growth.

Apart from financing for the first **CEX** listing, so that “**normies**” were able to join the project without having to go through **DeFi** if not tech-savvy enough to avoid being scammed, **Kendu Inu does not pay for any listing, call on Tg, post on X, video on YT or any other thing you can think of**.

All the influencers that talk about Kendu or CEXs that listed us have had to buy supply from the liquidity pool like any other person.

Kendu Miazaki explained this from the very beginning.

“**It might be slower, but it works**.” is what he used to say.

**Organic growth allows you to build a strong floor of diamond-handed holders** who fully believe in the project and do not believe in random FUD.

On the other hand, if you build your floor with people sent by influencers, everybody is ready to jeet at the first chance because they’re just there for a quick buck and do not see the bigger picture.

 

 

**6)  UTILITY AND SHIB ECOSYSTEM**

Even though all details have yet to be revealed, it is known that **$KENDU** will play a role in the Shib ecosystem, which might explain Shytoshi’s involvement in Kendu Inu.

Make no mistake, though, Miazaki has always said that **Kendu has its own identity** and will not just be one of the small dogs existing under the SHIB umbrella.

One of the first Kendu utilities, named **Kendu Chads**, will be released in the following weeks after being thoroughly tested for months by Miazaki’s team of developers.

**7)  THE DOG OF THIS CYCLE**

“Never two without three”.

People love dogs and always will. **DOGE** and **SHIB** were the first two dogs to reach **$10b**+ market cap.

**$KENDU** has everything it needs to be the third this coming bull run.

 

 

**8) 275M MARKET CAP WHEN THE MARKET WAS BLEEDING**

Kendu Inu reached an **ATH** of over **$275M market cap** when the whole crypto market, from BTC to all the shitcoins, was bleeding badly.

**Kendu is your hedge against the market** and will not wait for BTC to reach new ATHs before jumping to $1b market cap and beyond.

With that being said, when the actual bull run starts and all the random shitcoins are in green, what do you think will happen to a **strong project** like Kendu?

Multi billions are programmed.

 



**9)  BUILT ON ETH**

**Kendu Inu is only on ETH**. Love it or hate it, Ethereum is the king of all chains and sees fewer scams than all the other jeet chains such as SOL and BASE.

Since Kendu Inu is on ETH, and the liquidity pool is paired with ETH (KENDU:ETH), **when ETH goes up in value, so does KENDU**. As simple as that.

The news of the coming **ETH ETF** is super bullish news for all KENDU holders, both **short-term** and **long-term** investors.

 



**10)  GREAT-LOOKING CHART**

Even CMC, in their recent article, admitted that $KENDU chart looks very good and **on the verge of a breakout** from a pure TA standpoint, and they’re not aware of all the **alphas** behind the projects and all the future implementations that are going to be unveiled.

So, if you like technical analysis, you will like Kendu Inu chart.

**11)  GOAL: FIRST MEME COIN TO EVER CROSS $100b**

While every other project in the meme sphere tries hard to reach $1b market cap, at Kendu inu, we think that to be an embarrassing goal.

While Miazaki says that **“$10b is programmed**”, meaning it is inevitable, the real goal that excites our community is to be the first meme coin ever to cross $100b market cap.

Miazaki’s bio on Telegram says: “**Taking $KENDU to $100 BILLION and beyond!**”

Many experts expect this to be a “**super cycle**” and even more a “**meme super cycle**”, meaning we expect not only more liquidity to be deployed in the whole crypto space compared to 2021, but also that **meme coins will grab a much bigger % of that liquidity** flowing around compared to last cycle.

**We can then expect new ATHs for well-established projects** such as DOGE and SHIB, and that’s why, at KENDU, we’re working towards that $100b MC goal, which will not look as unrealistic at the peak of the bull run as it may does right now.

 



**12)  LOW MARKET CAP ≠ MORE GAINS**

Many people have been led to believe that the lower the market cap of a certain token, the better chance of making a 100x or 1000x. That is SO wrong and misleading.

90% or more of the “projects”, especially when launched on Solana or Base, **are complete scams**. Period.

The other 0.99% are projects created with the best intentions, but that, unfortunately, are going absolutely nowhere.

**Kendu Inu, at this stage, is bulletproof**. It has proved its value to everybody. “**We’re too big to fail**” is what Miazaki always says.

Kendu is going nowhere but up.

With such ambitious goals, a **100x means reaching about $15b market cap** (at the time of this writing), which is far from being out of reach for Kendu, especially considering we are about to enter what it’s supposed to be the **biggest cycle ever** (especially for meme coins).

Another thing to keep in mind is that when you invest in **super-low MC projects**, liquidity is so thin that any whale exiting their position leads to a cascade of sales caused by fear, especially since it’s not uncommon for investors of small projects to hold 5-10% of the total supply.

On bigger projects, instead, since liquidity is way thicker, you can **enter and exit your positions more accurately** without having nightmares about being rugged while asleep.

 

https://preview.redd.it/1a4row5fqcad1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0ab676c8aab4bd351620875cf6b919d71522a86a

  


**13) BEAUTIFUL SUPPLY REDISTRIBUTION**

At Kendu Inu, redistribution is ongoing **24/7**. When the market cap goes up, the number of holders goes up. When the market cap goes down, even significantly, the number of holders still goes up!

And that’s counting on-chain holders only! **With millions of $ of daily volume on CEXs**, God knows how many holders we actually have.



To make money with altcoins, especially memes, you need to understand two things:

1. What a good project is
2. Buy when everybody else is afraid to do it.

Kendu IS a good project.

Now, you have the opportunity to buy or top up your bags at 40% of the ATH.



If you like Kendu, this is the best time to become part of the army. See you on the other side!

103,2021-04-09,"Seascape.network the STEAM of DeFi...20x potential. Ticker: CWS/USDT on MXC.comMany of you have been waiting ages for my next investment call, and I've worked very hard to make sure I do not disappoint! Feel free to share my DD in any other subreddit or social media platform to raise awareness.

KEY DETAILS: CWS/USDT ([https://www.seascape.network/](https://www.seascape.network/))

**24h Trading Volume on MXC:** only 87,603 USDT

**24h Trading Range:** $25-$28.267

**Market Cap:** $26m (Audius was $27m when I first called them, it hit an ATH of $580m)

**Investors:** Binance, LD Capital, Paka, Spark Digital Capital, Nabais Capital, M6, DU Capital, JRR Capital.

**Partners:** Chainlink, Moonbeam, Opensea, Maker, Binance Smart Chain, Matic, Treasureland etc...

I got in at $25 today for $25k so far invested. Seeking price target of $500 (20x on $26m mcap to $520m in less than 8 weeks). Likely they will be listed on Binance around $125m mcap or sooner. It's Alt Season now so they *may* increase quicker OR ath may be higher OR both. Remember Audius took nearly 4 weeks to double from my 22 cent call then it exploded to $4.99. Price increases are not linear.

Recall, I developed a deep learning assisted bot to search the internet and work out which of these 1000s of silly coins will gain. CWS/USDT also popped up as another prime candidate gaining the traction metrics leading to organic big gains over the next few months. Add in a coordinated HODL at this volume level and you have a 20x-er. Untouched it has reached $50 by itself, **uncorrelated** generally to BTC, so its a prime alt season huge upswing candidate. Technicals also show a quick fib retracement to $50 within the next 2 weeks or sooner with good buying activity. No one was keeping track of what I said with Audius, this time, it may be different?

**Special Considerations:** Becoming the STEAM game distribution platform for DeFi is a much more realistic proposition than becoming a massive AAA-game developer such as the Activision of DeFi, we are years away from seeing anything like that. I've overseen game production in my past and it's a tough business! Delays happen all the time, and its ends up being expensive and taking much longer than anticipated (even if you x2 or x3 your most conservative time length expectations). Mu**ch better to be the picker and chooser of great games.** I also have contacts at Supercell (who made the great Clash of Clans) and I will hook these guys up. I spent the last few days talking to the founder of Seascape and drilled him for information and believe they are on the right track.

Like Audius, this is a coin with a website that the GENERAL PUBLIC CAN UNDERSTAND with a product that can be used now, granted they only have a few games, they are developing their blockchain to make it very cost effective and scalable for much bigger game titles to use them as their **in-game coin economy** partner, even if they have better distribution than seascape now. Seascape is an **in-game economy technology partner first and foremost. They are doing the hard stuff, unlike Ultra, so that they later this year become the distribution partner of choice for DeFi game titles.** Ultra is just steam with tokens and they are already around $250m market cap right now, so you see, Seascape could blow them out of the water!

**SEE BELOW FOR COMPETITOR ANALYSIS for when Seascape was JUST $528k mcap** at a $10m private investor valuation (when they first listed - they caught up to that private investor valuation within weeks and that was picked up by my crypto bot - very sorry for the few weeks lag, my bot still needs to crunch data, still working out how to find gems right when they first list but that's an extremely hard thing to do!!)

However, as with Audius, I hope another 20x is good enough, BUT I picked this up much sooner than Audius after listing so 30x is my hopium target although I don't want to be too bold. I am seeking $750 take profit if this one keeps rising strongly after surpassing $500.

NFTs: 25,000 NFTs minted on BSC and millions of dollars dropped to users through their LP mining game. Increase in its NFT economy alone could add an extra $50m-$100m to its mcap over the next few months.

**High number of coins in a few wallets:** Audius had a similar position where 84% of coins were held in 2 wallets. Seascape's token release schedule is structured to cause growth in their ecosystem and corresponding growth in their price to mitigate future inflation effects. Essentially new games will be backed by newly released CWS acting as collateral for newly minted game coin economies generated on the Seascape blockchain. This means, as a new game grows its user base and its in game economy grows in value, those additionally released CWS should in effect pay for themselves mitigating inflation effects. Interestingly, Audius had a similar reason for releasing new coins, i.e. to attract new artists, and it grew from $27m mcap to an ath of $580m.

&#x200B;

**The Universal Law of Crypto**

People who simply knew of and understood crypto in its early days have now been rewarded with hundreds of billions of dollars of wealth. And while crypto price action has been volatile, the industry has been consistent in two things since its inception:

1. **Those who understand cryptocurrencies have been financially rewarded.**
2. **Those who invest in cryptocurrencies without understanding have been financially punished.**

&#x200B;

**The Three Rules for Altcoin Analysis**

If knowledge inefficiency allows us to create outsized returns for our portfolio, then the way to create reliable alpha (excess ROI) is to set up a repeatable process where we can research and understand cryptocurrencies. Fundamental analysis is difficult, but it does not require special education, exclusive information, or super-genius level brains.

>**In today's market conditions, any halfway-clever investor can perform research that will allow them to generate better-than-average returns on their cryptocurrency portfolios.**

In my time as as an Altcoin Research Analyst, I've established a simple fundamental framework I go through to perform basic prospecting on all of the cryptocurrencies I research.

While this framework isn't comprehensive, it is a starting point that will give you a solid foundation for better understanding cryptocurrencies, and thus, make better investing decisions. I've broken it down into three rules: three questions to which you must have answers.

If you have a strong grasp on how these three rules apply to the altcoin you're researching, you are well on your way to making a good, informed investing decision for the given cryptocurrency.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lbw9il08egt71.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b4690472999512436cbc30b05d99095567b134b

The single most important thing to understand in a cryptocurrency is how it provides value for its users. This can often be distilled down to just a few words or sentences, but it sometimes can be tricky to wrap your head around.

We'll take a look at a few of the biggest cryptos for inspiration:

* **Bitcoin:** “a decentralized digital currency, without a central bank or single administrator, that can be sent from user to user on a peer-to-peer network without the need for intermediaries.”
* [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/)**:** “a decentralized, open-source blockchain with smart contract functionality.”
* [Polkadot](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/polkadot-new/)**:** “a blockchain network that connects, builds, and hosts blockchains.”

Conversely, many cryptos thought to be poor investments have flimsy (or sometimes no) value propositions

* [Bitconnect](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitconnectx-genesis/)**:** Crypto’s most famous scam intended to “build trust and reputation in bitcoin and cryptocurrency ecosystem with Open-source platform.” (What does that even mean?)
* [Safemoon](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/polkadot)**:** When you start diving into Safemoon’s documentation, you find a lot more related to their tokenomics (burning and redistributing sold Safemoon) than the value it hopes to add to the world.

https://preview.redd.it/827dxhu8egt71.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=d91ecc84b4fd1cf7ee4d34d02d9155a19ef37212

If you couldn't explain to your Mom/Dad/Relative how this might add value to the world, it's a signal you need do more research and reading. White papers, the foundational documents of cryptos, are pretty helpful in this respect, (look up ""target cryptocurrency"" + white paper to find it) although they can be quite dense. Project roadmaps, often hosted on the crypto's official website are helpful as well.

Explore your curiosity and dive into what you don't understand. This is not the time to be shy or embarrassed about what you don't get, you're going to be putting your hard-earned money on the line: Twitter, Reddit, and Discord are all your friends.

Understanding how a crypto creates value allows you to:

1. Establish a thesis for why the crypto will rise in value
2. Determine when that thesis has been invalidated

This value proposition will serve as the foundation for the rest of your research.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/men473daegt71.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=95574b2651eb19b3ff99dba5e569781853d2e7ce

It’s not enough that a cryptocurrency simply adds value to the world: it must have incentives built in to facilitate increasing demand that outpaces supply.

**Success Stories:**

Bitcoin and Ethereum are both successful examples of cryptocurrencies that have created markets where demand eclipses supply, which causes price to appreciate. Bitcoin has accomplished the feat by creating a solid monetary policy base (slowly decreasing mining rewards and a capped supply).

Ethereum has started to burn Eth tokens since the EIP-1559 hard fork was activated, creating a deflationary supply while network activity continues to increase, driving demand. Before the EIP-1559, Eth's supply still outpaced demand thanks to high network activity across DeFi platforms, NFT minting, peer-to-peer transactions, and other tokens that existed on the network.

Exchange token FTX uses network proceeds to buy back and burn tokens, creating deflationary pressure that in theory causes the price to rise.

**Lessons:**

There are plenty examples of misaligned supply/demand pressures as well. Yield Farm/DeFi platform Iron Finance had a ‘bank run’ style collapse on on June 16th, 2021. The cause of the collapse? Poor management of supply and demand. Too much of the native farm token (TITAN) flooded the market as TITAN holders were not sufficiently incentivized to hold.

Since it was used as collateral for the yield farms, the entire ecosystem fell apart. To avoid a fate like that of Iron Finance investors, make sure you understand exactly why investors may choose to buy, hold, and sell a token.

White Papers are one way to understand these dynamics, while simply taking part in the ecosystem helps you get an intimate understanding of the incentives that affect market participants.

You can also take a look at CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap to see how much of a given coin has been mined (and thus how much it will be diluted). Total Value Locked (TVL) shows you how many dollars of a given asset is secured inside of a protocol, hypothetically showing you how much that protocol might generate in revenue and how confident players are in the protocols permanence.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2hze255cegt71.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=5856d33c8a64c1dd05c155fce05e0ea605e41835

Why is Ethereum such a strong investment? It’s constantly being criticized for its slow transactions, its high fees, and it’s develop first/fix later, it’s managed to attract thousands of the most talented developers, marketers, artists, and community builders in the world. Nonetheless, it's the king of altcoins.

**Team**

Every individual working on Ethereum or on any project around Ethereum is creating value for Ethereum holders. Lending platforms like AAVE, NFT platforms like OpenSea, and Level Two (L2) ecosystems like $MATIC are all built on top of Ethereum. People building on Ethereum creates network effects that make other people want to build their platforms on Ethereum, which brings more smart, talented people ad infitum. The lesson? Work to understand who is working on a platform and why they are there.

Does the core team have a strong background in blockchain tech? Can you watch interviews or check their social media to get a feel for them? Are they transparent and accessible or mysterious and elusive? All of these can help us get a better feel for the project.

**Team Incentives**

We also must understand the stakeholders’ incentives. Some projects (Decentraland is one that comes to mind) have gotten criticism recently, as vesting has ended and now the founders now have access to all of the tokens that were once locked up. Because the founders won’t be rewarded with any meaningful quantity of new tokens, and the project’s market cap is around $1 billion, there’s not as much incentive for the founders to be working hard on development.

**Whale Wallets**

Finally, we should look at whale wallets: who are the biggest holders? Why do they hold so much of the currency? Is their stake large enough to manipulate the supply?

Dogecoin gets a lot of this criticism: thanks to the miracle of public ledgers, we can see how much of a given currency the biggest whales own. The top 11 Dogecoin whales own around 47% of the total supply, meaning they could easily influence the price of the currency should they choose. The top Ethereum wallet, in comparison, owns a mere 1.65% of the total Ethereum supply. It’s easy to understand which coin is less likely to be manipulated.

Team info can be found by poking around Twitter and the team pages of official project sites. Info on incentives is often found on Medium, while whale wallet data can be found by poking around on blockchain explorers and on-chain analytics platforms.

&#x200B;

**Picking Winners**

This framework is not a silver bullet, but it is a simple, replicable process for understanding cryptocurrencies that can be applied at any point in a market cycle to drastically decrease your probability of picking duds while simultaneously increasing your probability of picking the rare 1000x investment when it does come along.

I'm sure there is all the **potential to do a 1000x** in the next few days, and now I'll explain why:

Why will Avengerscoin make a x1000?

1. The Metaverse is the future, all the media and Facebook are talking about it has invested several billion dollars in the construction.
2. How many tokens can boast of having this name?
3. They have already released the first 10 NFTs
4. Community of over 15k users.
5. Really low marketcap (150k $).
6. Team of over 15 people.

Why do I think Avengerscoin is RUGPULL FREE?

1. The team has no wallet.
2. Liquidity is locked for 1 year.
3. The contract has been audited.

What is the usefulness of Avengerscoin?

This is the great thing! They want (and have already started) to create an **Avengers-themed collectible card game (NFTs) but with the rules of Magic The Gatherin** thanks to which users will be able to earn more NFTs or AVCs.

Butter Token, a revolutionary new token on the Binance network, is changing the way cryptocurrency investors are thinking about charity. May 14’s $354,000 donation is Butter Token’s largest contribution to food charities to date, following a $6,311 donation on May 1st. In total, the token has raised over $375,000 since it’s launch on 4/4/21.

The token works by utilizing a fee on every transaction. A portion of that fee is sent to the “Charity Wallet” where investors can then vote on which charity receives the funds. A percentage of every donation goes to Butter Token’s partner charity, Food for Life Global, and the remainder of the funds are donated to the winning charity. Today, Beast Philanthropy received $300,000 and Food for Life Global received $54,000, which will provide more than 500,000 meals to hungry children. “This donation will help us distribute an excess 300,000 meals”, says Darren Margolias the Executive Director at Beast Philanthropy.

The creator of Butter token, Christian Claypool says Butter and its companion, Milk Token, are still in the early “start-up stage”, but says the token is starting to gain recognition even outside of cryptocurrency spaces. He’s looking forward to seeing the impact the token has on the effort to end hunger as it continues to grow. “I'm proud of the fact that we are able to generate so much funding for charity at such a low MCAP. For example, the last donation of $360,000 came from Butter at a $6m MCAP. If Butter had the same MCAP as Milk at the time, our donation would have been over $1 million,” he said. Paul Turner, CEO of Food For Life Global agrees, saying, “the proof of this is the sheer amount of money they have already donated to hunger relief charities like [ours], far exceeding other tokens with much larger market cap.”

News from this week:
• Donation of $305k to Beast Philanthropy and Food For Life Global

• $Milk Trending on Coin Market Cap 

• $Butter listed on [CMC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/butter-token/)

Milk and Butter tokens, for those that haven’t heard, are companion tokens in the Binance Smart Chain with an emphasis on charity giving. Milk is an RFI token that can be staked to generate Butter, which is used to power community voting for their favorite charities on a weekly basis. Those that merely wish to vote may purchase Butter tokens on the open market as well, which also drives rewards for those that stake Milk! 
https://www.milktoken.net/voting.html

5% of all Butter transactions are guaranteed to go to a charity wallet. In addition, Butter can be used to suggest new charities.
https://www.milktoken.net/suggest.html

$25,000 has been donated to charity so far, at a market cap of only 800K. We made crypto history when Butter became the first BEP-20 token to partner with a major food charity: Food For Life Global  https://ffl.org/20077/cryptocurrency-butter-token/

The liquidity for both the Milk and Butter tokens is locked away until 2022, at which point both will be relocked. Our Market cap is still low with a solid base, we're building our community for healthy growth, and we’ll continue to develop this project with many exciting use cases plus a full array of features to be rolled out as development completes.

Each week the Milk and Butter token team hosts AMAs with the Developer on Twitch where the community can ask any questions they may have. Occasionally, we have guests, last week the CEO of “Food For Life Global” joined us and explained the amazing genesis of “Food for Life Global” and took viewer questions. Our AMA’s stream every Sunday at 3am UTC [here.](https://www.twitch.tv/milkbuttertoken)

Roadmap: 
• Next week gamification of Butter begins with lotto/bingo games being implemented.

\- Updated Whitepaper (see below)

**Competitors:**

The number of available brokerages in the UK is extremely limited. The main competitors are Trading212, IBKR, eToro. As many have seen there are complaints about all of these trading platforms.

111,2021-04-26,"MelloToken Update: April 26th, 2021 First Mello Medium article, giveaway closed, developments on the horizon What is Mello?

The Mello Token is a redistributive cryptocurrency built on Binance Smart Chain (BSC). The fast and inexpensive transactions of BSC make the Mello Token perfect for integration into our Virtual Reality Casino concept. A 3% redistribution fee is placed on all transfers, purchases, and sales of Mello (outside of exchanges) which is rewarded to all holders. Put simply, all holders of Mello earn rewards on a constant basis which will be eligible for play inside the Mello casino.  
 

Why Mello?  
 The Mello team has been equal parts meticulous and aggressive in the development process of their project thus far. The team has already shown their faces and are obviously committed... they have been checking off items from their roadmap one by one.  
   
 

Entering the enormous casino market with high transaction volume, the 3% redistribution has the potential to prove wildly beneficial for holders of Mello.  
 Launched a month ago and with a market cap of roughly $12 million, Mello Token has tons of room to grow.

 Building the casino

The first iteration Mello web Casino will launch by the end of Q3 / beginning of Q4, after which the team will be focusing their efforts on Virtual Reality development and partnerships. 

GammaStack Partnership

Mello recently announced a partnership with GammaStack.  
 GammaStack began operations a decade ago as a bespoke software development company, and today stands tall as an established IT solutions provider that has helped guide more than 500 clients across the world in building successful tech projects.

Gammastack offers tailored services which help organizations to accelerate the integration of the latest technology trends including AR and Blockchain integrations.

Mello is currently in the process of forming further partnerships which will help facilitate the development of other aspects of the Mello vision.

The first Mello Medium article was posted today, April 26th! 

Check out our article on medium for a short read summarizing the story of Mello, our progress so far, and where we are headed in the near future!

[https://mellotoken.medium.com/mello-token-our-story-8bce750d403a](https://mellotoken.medium.com/mello-token-our-story-8bce750d403a)

Community involvement / Giveaway Competitions

The Mello team has continually been in contact with its community. We are always available in our voice channel on discord for any sort of queries and concerns. Our artists have been streaming their construction of 3D assets, and we have been holding frequent contests and giveaways as well.

Our best meme contest ended today at 11am PST! If you were the winner, make sure you claim your prize!

4,130 Holders as of April 26th, 2021  
 Just two days ago, Mello initiated the 4th of 10 promised burns of 1 Million tokens! The circulating supply of Mello is now down to 410 Million tokens.

Mello Token is now trackable on Coinbase. Check us out here:

114,2024-06-22,"Project with the BIGGEST potential in the upcoming Bull-run.As crypto is becoming more mainstream, people are more than ever starting to invest in it. That means that now, besides crypto enthusiasts, we have more 'regular' people in the cryptocurrency space.
And as it turns out, 'regular Joes' LOVE Meme coins.

I know that there are crypto projects that are working on 'legit' utilities and real life purposes, but they aren't getting the same action and exposure that Meme coins are getting. It's just the way it is.
Could be a sign that the majority of the cryptocurrency space are now 'Regular Joes', which is not a bad thing (Mass adoption).

With that being said, we can conclude that Meme coins have MASSIVE potential in this upcoming bull run.
And home of the Meme coins is, whether some would like to admit it or not, Solana network. (Fast, secure, and nearly non-existent transaction fees).
Expected rise of the price of Solana in this upcoming bullrun will have a positive 'consequence' - Meme coins on Solana network will grow in price accordingly as well.

In the sea of Meme coin projects in Solana, there is one that stands tall and stand out - our boy $HEGE. 

$HEGE started out on Reddit, and that is why we rightfully call it Hege's home.

Disclosure wise, I am a presaler on this project (65k MC), and in the moment of writing $HEGE's Market Cap is 16.5 million dollars.
Idea of selling never crossed my mind. Actually, I kept buying and adding to my bag as a firm believer of this project and its community.

In the Meme coin space, community and content (memes) is something that makes or breaks a project, not the other way around. And $HEGE has it all.

Community is strong, united, and most importantly, HEALTHY. You actually feel comfortable and pleased being in the TG groupchat (Our notorious HEGEQUARTERS).
You feel proud and like you're a part of something (Yes, it's possible. Even in this sea of scams and rug-pulls).
Besides TG Group and dedicated channels for different cultures, we got Discord server. Little bit of everything for everyone.

Content and memes part wise, $HEGE has BY FAR the best ones in the game, with all due respect to other projects.
Community and Dev. team is full of graphic designers and creative people, and that is the reason we dominate with the Content and Shilling material (And we'll only be getting better and better!).
Cheap and non-professional AI artwork is not something we do, and what you're used to seeing today.
Mentioned content and memes are then used by our hardworking community members, in relentless raidings we do.

As $HEGE is slowly getting the exposure he truly deserves, we got ourselves 3 CEX listings on the 25th of June.
BIG Marketing push is planned to follow up the CEX listings, which means that fun and exciting times are ahead of us.

It's nice being a part of something where you're not scared that your holdings went down to 0 overnight. We can proudly say we are rug-proof!

Feel free to check out our mentioned HegeQuarters (Telegram group), I'm sure you'll enjoy your stay and meet some wonderful people. We have a 100 Million Market Cap holders party planned out in London!

We're currently having a 500$ Giveaway! Head over to our official X account for more details.

I'll conclude this post with the following message;
Trust me when I say, it's still not too late to become a holder of this undervalued gem!

$HEGE Rocket WILL fly to a Billion dollar Market Cap either way, so you might as well join us on our journey. We'd be glad to have you!

115,2024-06-19,"A synopsis of crow with knife ($CAW) - Why it's worth looking intocrow with knife ($CAW) has huge upside potential in what will be the biggest memecoin season ever this bullrun. 

Memecoins are a dime a dozen at the moment, the market is absurdly oversaturated. Caw is different though, not just because it's actually a famous meme but also because of the following points: 

100% circulating supply since day 1- devs bought in at the same price as everyone else. Contract renounced, code cannot can be altered, no more tokens Mintabie. 

Available on Solana, Base, Cronos, Polygon, and the Binance Smart Chain, as well as 2 centralised exchanges, all from the same supply of 777 trillion tokens total across all chains. Caw-specific bridges make it easy to bridge tokens across chains. 

Currently 48m market cap, about 40% of ATH. Huge liquidity pool, currently 3.8m on cronos. 2.5m-3m of this is owned by VVS (dex on cronos) who has locked it for the next 11 months (was part of an agreement for a token VVS released about a month ago where you could pay with CAW, they would match it with CRO and add to LP and lock for 1 year). Liquidity on other chains continuing to build. 

Ridiculously healthy coin distribution. Of the top 10 wallets - 

Wallet #1 is owned by crypto.com 

Wallet #2 is owned by crypto.com 

Wallet #3 is also owned by crypto.com 

Wallet #4 is the VVS dex LP 

Wallet #5 is a bridge address 

Wallet #7 is the burn wallet 

10.5k holders on cronos, 2.2k on solana, 1.3k on base. Indeterminate number holding via crypto.com app/exchange and bitmart (though crypto.com and their users own around 40% of the supply right now so there are a *lot*. 

Listed on crypto.com and bitmart, another top 10 CEX fundraise is in progress right now and about 65% of the way there. Community has contributed 100% of the listing fees for payments so far as there is no reserved marketing wallet (read: no risk of being dumped on) Currrently $100k raised in just over a week, with another $120k in the treasury from a prior fundraise. This will be a legitimate, tier 1 centralised exchange, not some pump and dump fake volume mill.

Fanatical, cult-like community across discord, telegram, Twitter, reddit. Every day is a flurry of activity, memes degen humour, inside jokes, shitposting. The discord in particular is an absolute zoo and ridiculously compelling. This is mixed with genuine, wholesome support- rallying behind crows going through hardship like bereavement and donating to those who have been drained by scammers. 

The memes. Dear God the memes. Endless, dizzying, constant memes, not just basic image macros but insane numbers of photoshops, art, gifs, videos, music. Relatable and enjoyed by normies- I had a quote tweet by Ice-T a few days ago which was liked by hundreds of non-crypto users https://twitter.com/FINALLEVEL/status/1801558231547822273?t=lvVej_BCcHfFVCaHg9R8nA&s=19

There’s likely to be big demand for XRD because it’s the primary token of the Radix blockchain, which is a highly specialized decentralized ledger that’s purpose built for DeFi. Unlike other blockchains such as Ethereum and Solana, Radix follows what it calls an “asset-oriented” approach to DeFi, in which cryptocurrency tokens and NFTs are treated as native assets on its platform.

**TradeStrike Lite.**

I have covered most of the main topics in my previous [DD here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/p15b2c/tradestrike_lite_dd_an_insight/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf).

Not much new news has been released to the public on when the DEX will be launched. We do know that it is fully operational and looks amazing. 

**TradeStrike DeFi Wallet**

On August 22nd it was officially announced that TradeStrike has its very own DeFi Wallet in development. 

As said in the article: 

“we believe our own fiat-to-crypto-enabled wallet will push us on to the next level in our journey. Working with the development team at the global software company; [Antier Solutions](https://www.antiersolutions.com/)” 

Antier Solutions Pvt Ltd (Antech) is a cryptocurrency exchange development company that has been delivering highly secure and scalable solutions using blockchain technology from the past 9 years. This is great to hear from TradeStrike as Antier Solutions is a well experienced company. It was founded in 2003 and has 51-200 employees. 

The DeFi Wallet is set to launch end of Q4 2021. You can read the [full article here](https://tradestrike.medium.com/our-wallet-is-officially-in-development-daf6a777cb28)

**Top Tier Partnership**

So we don’t know much about this yet. However TradeStrike have been teasing it on their [Twitter](https://twitter.com/trade_strike/status/1427624935288188937?s=21).

**Certik Audit**

After being first announced on 14th June on their [Twitter](https://twitter.com/trade_strike/status/1404385644026159104?s=21) the TradeStrike team has been actively working to ensure that the DEX is on point. The most important thing being the security. This is why the audit has taken so long. Certik is a company we can trust to do this audit the right way. 

On the 4th September 2021, TradeStrike [tweeted](https://twitter.com/trade_strike/status/1434086246972895241?s=21) an update about the audit. Certik have passed on recommendations to the developers that will be rectified fully.

**TradeStrike Website 2.0**

“It marks a change in the way in which we present ourselves and should answer all questions from people that are unsure” - Kishan Vadgama (TradeStrike CCO) 

From [this Tweet](https://twitter.com/aiyokish/status/1411831557183135748?s=21) by Kishan he says there was some “Surprise developments” which has made it be out on hold until “ETA Next Month”.

* AMA #2 
* Serious Investors

AMA 2 was released on the 22nd August and can be watched on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/vyP041LiAJA). 

They cover:

* Business Updates 
* Why DEX hasn’t launched yet 
* Announcements 

**Serious Investors.**

Today Joe Jowett announced that a large investor bought 3.1Million coins today through an OTC deal and the money is going straight to the Liquidity Pool.

Joe also announced that a second large investor bough 3.5Million coins.

There was a Liquidity Pool goal and it was smashed today with the 6.6Million coins bought. I am not too sure at what price these investors bought at but the current valuation for 6.6Million coins is $559,270.

**Conclusion**

Now that I have covered everything that has happened over the last 6 weeks I hope that this has caught you up well. 

I am glad to finally be back as it seems I have missed a lot ! Last time I was here the price was $0.007 now it’s nearing $0.10 ! Congratulations to all those who held and Welcome to all the newcomers who are buying for the first time. 

Here’s to health, wealth and prosperity.

1. Tag u/coinscan-bot under any post/comment mentioning a token's address, or any link to it (like CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko etc). Mention of the name/symbol won't work, as a lot of tokens share those.

I made a post about $HEGE yesterday but due to our rapidly quick growth, I have to make another one today to keep you all updated about what is happening in our community and what has changed since yesterday. Fasten your seatbelts because this is going to be a hell of a ride!!

**So, what are the hottest topics in our community right now?**

Competitions and giveaways- There are 3 comps/giveaways running this weekend. Reddit competition, Tiktok competition and Twitter giveaway to celebrate our CEX listings. There are around 150k tokens in prices which is roughly $3,000. Join our Telegram if you want to find out more about them.

CEX listings- Our 3 CEX listings are not anything new and you have probably already heard about them. BUT, admins are already talking with other exchanges about potential listings in the future. Considering our market cap, volume, holders etc. I believe it is definitely CEX from top 15.

Marketing- We all believe in organic marketing, raiding and working for our bags but paid marketing is important if you want to play at a higher level and match coins like PONKE or even PEPE or SHIB. Our dev and admin team know that so they decided to start with paid marketing push next week on the day of our CEX listing.

Hollywood plane- JC, one of our community members, said earlier this week that if we reach 20M market cap by Sunday, he will pay for an airplane with a HEGE banner to fly over HOLLYWOOD sign. And guess what? We did it, JC is now preparing everything for this monumental moment because he is a man of his word.

**Now, let's take a look at our growth in numbers**

* Market cap: 14M > 25M
* Holders: 6800 > 7000
* Telegram members: 4700 > 4900
* Twitter (X) followers: 7200 > 8100
* 1M all-time total impressions on X achieved this week

# Conclusion

As you can see, we are taking this really seriously. Our community is full of diamond handed and hard working people and our hard work is finally paying off. We are reching new ATH every day and creating new floor much higher than the previous one, hundreds of new holders and community members are joining us every day and the best part is that this is just the beginning. We achieved all of this during red market! Solana is still at $130 but we did nearly 2x in the last 24 hours. So if you are tired of being rugged all the time and want to finally buy a promising memecoin with 50x or even bigger potential, buy a bag now because we are going much higher.

And if you want to do more research before buying, go through our website or join our Telegram to see for yourself what we are capable of.

Monero hard fork makes hackers' favorite coin even more private XMROn 12 August 2022 the number of transactions in [Monero](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/monero/) network reaches 25% of transactions in Bitcoin network. Monero hard fork makes hackers' favorite coin even more private.

Monero's latest network update further boosts transaction source and privacy on an already uncracked system, making it a real challenge for deciphering efforts.

Monero beats Bitcoin on privacy, fungibility, transaction fees, and mining algorithm. Bitcoin beats Monero when it comes to transaction speed, scalability, network effect, supply, and price. Therefore, it's hard to pick a clear winner when comparing these two crypto assets.

After the update on August 13, the number of users has increased significantly, which indicates a great potential for growth and trust in the anonymity of the coin.

*And because Monero already does not use a traditional public ledger, but has several keys like “view keys” to see transactions published on the blockchain, tracing funds from one address to another is already a near impossible task.*

125,2021-04-24,"MelloToken Update: April 24, 2021 Video AMA, Token Burn, Coinbase Tracking.What is Mello?

The Mello Token is a redistributive cryptocurrency built on Binance Smart Chain (BSC). The fast and inexpensive transactions of BSC make the Mello Token perfect for integration into our Virtual Reality Casino concept. A 3% redistribution fee is placed on all transfers, purchases, and sales of Mello (outside of exchanges) which is rewarded to all holders. Put simply, all holders of Mello earn rewards on a constant basis which will be eligible for play inside the Mello casino.

&#x200B;

Why Mello?

The Mello team has been equal parts meticulous and aggressive in the development process of their project thus far. The team has already shown their faces and are obviously committed... they have been checking off items from their roadmap one by one.

Entering the enormous casino market with high transaction volume, the 3% redistribution has the potential to prove wildly benificial for holders of Mello.

Launched a month ago and with a market cap of roughly $12 million, Mello Token has tons of room to grow.

&#x200B;

Building the casino

The first iteration Mello web Casino will launch by the end of Q3 / beginning of Q4, after which the team will be focusing their efforts on Virtual Reality development and partnerships. 

&#x200B;

GammaStack Partnership

Mello recently announced a partnership with GammaStack.

GammaStack began operations a decade ago as a bespoke software development company, and today stands tall as an established IT solutions provider that has helped guide more than 500 clients across the world in building successful tech projects.

Gammastack offers tailored services which help organizations to accelerate the integration of the latest technology trends including AR and Blockchain integrations.

Mello is currently in the process of forming further partnerships which will help facilitate the development of other aspects of the Mello vision.

&#x200B;

4,000 Holders as of April 24, 2021

&#x200B;

Today, Mello initiated the 4th of 10 promised burns of 1 Million tokens! The circulating supply of Mello is now down to 410 Million tokens.

The MATIC network has been exploded, apart from a few 'not so minor' hiccups in the market recently, the growth has been strong and we have seen an influx of people into the Polygon mainnet.

&#x200B;

One of the first memecoins (bare with me here) to launch on the network was PolyDoge, but it is already setting itself up as much more than a memecoin. With staking, liquidity pools and brand new NFT's released yesterday for people who were holding the coin a few days ago, PolyDoge is setting the gold standard on this young and upcoming network. 

&#x200B;

There is a great community on telegram, who stayed positive throughout the dip, with amazing fan art and even a song on spotify! (released today). Pop in for a look and join the 4150 and growing strong community who genuinely believe that this (still small market cap) coin is destined for great things.

We made our own crypto with Blackjack & Hookers![Sick and tired](https://i.imgur.com/5RB4ElL.jpeg) of soulless projects and worthless meme coins running rampant in the crypto market, an enigmatic figure known only by the name ""Dank Bender"" reached a tipping point.  
‍  
Frustrated with the lack of integrity and genuine value in existing projects, Dank Bender decided to take matters into his own hands. He shall do what needs to be done!  
‍  
So he proclaimed with a grin: ""Fuck it!  I’ll make my own meme coin with Blackjack and Hookers!’’

And so he [DID](https://www.2169.gg/)!

Fueled by equal parts ambition and intoxication, he forged ahead, leaving a trail of chaos in his wake that shall echo through the crypto market for years to come.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

[Blackjack & Hookers](https://coinmarketcap.com/) is just one big chaotic crypto game designed by Dank Bender in which you try to gain $BJH coins and profit trough a series of events happening on and off the blockchain.

Dank Bender is in charge of the game and is the one who sets the rules. He acts as a kind of an overseer.  
A dungeon master, if you will. Weaving intricate tales on the blockchain, some of it planned and a lot of it improvised cuz there’s no accounting for human stupidity.

It's up to you, the player, to create your own take on the story!  
Your actions shape the world, the tinman’s setup, and every person will have their own take on the tale.

Embark on a unique crypto experience an on chain crypto world is shaped by the actions of the community and their interaction with the tin mans story. Keep your eyes sharp and roll the dice; you might just be the biggest winner of them all!

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

So, dear fellow crypto bros, if you're ready to ride  
the rollercoaster of chaos with us, answer the CALL!  
‍  
Let's defy the odds, challenge the status quo  
and raise a glass to the absurdity of it ALL!

This big drop surely is less than a month away. I curated most sources and breadcrumbs to save you time researching. This is happening with our without you and for some reason Miazaki said have at 'least 1 million KENDU.'

I also added the list of current CEXs with CoinEx just announcing this morning. 

**DO DOs**: do more research, jump in the TG and learn and get a feel,  ask questions, hop on X and check out  @KenduInu and/or @KenduMiazaki, **scroll all pics**

**DON'T DOs**: ask me wen this dropping (one post said 60% completed with no starting reference), ask me what KENDU Chads is exactly, **continue to fade KENDU**

135,2021-04-06,"My prev post got you x15. Martian DAO aiming for the sameIt literally just launched, gaining major traction. Don't miss your opportunity.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Martian DAO (MDAO)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It’s been talked about in here before for a short minute but now the project has gone LIVE and it has sold out 250 BNB for a BRAND new project with barely any shelling it’s time to talk about it again. A cool project with a very transparent dev and a good ass looking website. Martian!

In 24 hours the telegram has grown 800 members now coming up to 1.1k members! The growth this coin has been having so far is insane. With a 100k market cap the potential is huge. Developer has renounced ownership of the coin and the dev wallet is locked for at least 3 months so people don’t have to be scared of an dev dump.

What is Martian you might ask? Glad you asked!

Martian is an fun, engaging, community-driven project. Using tokenomics tried-and-true HODLERS of MDAO will take advantage of frictionless farming token that employs 3 simple functions: Reflection + LP acquisition + burn. For each trade, the transaction is taxed at an 8% fee, which is split 2 ways. 4% is redistributed to all existing holders + 4% is split 50/50 of which half is sold by the contract into BNB whilst the other half of the MDAO tokens are paired automatically with the previously mentioned BNB and added as a liquidity pair on Pancakeswap to ensure the LP pool keeps growing.

MDAO is a themed-based crypto game, an experimential project with the goal of building a martian army. Every two weeks Martian DAO will release an exclusive pre-sale which for the purposes of MDAO will be called missions. For example our first mission after launch will be mobilization. The pre-sales rolled out by Martian DAO are designed to be fun but high-risk, high reward projects. The goal of the projects are:

1: To build the martian community and strengthen our army for future missions

2: Raise capital to be used for BUYBACKS and BURN events. Team expansion and marketing aswell. Some future plans also include a launchpad for the public to create their very own missions.

The Milk token is a burn/redistribution/auto-liquidity token on the Binance Smart Chain with a focus on Community giving.
MilkToken.net

During the first week since launch, the token has already raised $4000 for charity through the presale funds and contributions from the community. 
These donations were made to Feeding America and Action against hunger.
The goal of the Milk Token is to capture some of the money flowing through crypto-assets on the Binance Smart Chain and deliver it to a good cause

Butter Token is not only a token that can be bought with BNB, but one that will also be gained as a reward for staking the Milk Token.

milktoken.net/churn

This butter token will be used to automate the collection of funds for charity by way of a transaction fee that is sold into BNB and reserved for a charity wallet on every transaction.
The main goal of the Milk Token team is to create a system utilizing the Milk and Butter tokens that becomes the core mechanism for charitable giving on the Binance Smart Chain.

About staking: Staking allows a Milk user to have the Butter contract hold on to some of their Milk, up to 50% of their balance. This stake can be reclaimed at any time by the rightful owner and there are no fees other than gas for the transaction for staking and unstaking Milk. 

Milk that is staked will accrue rewards in the form of Butter tokens based upon a user's percentage of the total staked Milk pool. These Butter rewards can be claimed at any time and there are no fees other than gas for the transaction for recovering the Butter rewards.

So Milk churns Butter which I’m turn gathers charity funds to help feed the world. It’s a win win!",positive,0.93578523,74

Some of you here know about the sleeping giant that is Syscoin (currently celebrating its 7th birthday this week) 

[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/syscoin/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/syscoin/)

Well my friends, today is the day the Syscoin team unveiled the first screenshots of their NEVM! (""Network Enhanced Virtual Machine"") As a matter of fact, the NEVM is currently live on a private testnet, & the public testnet phase is anticipated approximately three weeks from now. Heard enough? Go  the screenshots on the official blog post!

[https://syscoin.org/news/syscoin-platform-news-update](https://syscoin.org/news/syscoin-platform-news-update)

**I'm Intrigued, Tell Me More**

By launching the NEVM, Syscoin will be unique in that it will not only have *Turning Complete smart contracts* (and have the ability to port over contracts from ETH), but it is also merge-mined with Bitcoin, so you get the decentralized smart contract & DeFi capabilities of ETH, plus the hardened security of Bitcoin (did you know that Syscoin has the second highest hashrate of any coin ... period?)  Also of note: the speeds are insane, scalability is through the roof\* & that fees (to mint NFTs, gas, etc) are microscopically tiny. \*audited by Whiteblock",positive,0.83235997,70

He's not the guy who would tarnish his credibility for money to shill a random shitcoin. He's made millions. He sees the potential.

This is all part of a larger campaign to get us connected to wealthier potential holders. There are top secret deals being made that are much bigger than this announcement. The devs had to sign NDA for everything. The staking and NFT are getting the finishing touches. They're working on a series of educational videos for potential investors. We have so much more coming down the pipeline. Haters are gonna spread FUD and haters are gonna miss out on a token that’s built for the long term. We ain’t going nowhere. The Ultrasafe mansion has marble no rugs to be pulled here. We don't need any superficial pumps. We know the token will speak for itself when the time comes. We're fine-tuning it to be ready for a bull market. 3rd audit coming not because they have to but because they want to. We’re safe and we can prove it. Devs are hell-bent on being a top 5 altcoin. The community is a tight-knit group. It's made to succeed. There's no excuse not to buy at this cheap price. There are a couple of seats left on the rocket.

- Main net launching in 13 days.

- Only 10m marketcap and 25% of the marketcap is locked into staking at the moment betweeen pre main net staking and staking on Kucoin.

- Tech wise on the same level and even better then Elrond and Harmony which are both at a 50-100X higher marketcap.
  MultiVAC is the first one to propose a flexible computing framework, so the developers can trade-off freely about the blockchain trilemma on this framework.

- Backing by the CEO of Kucoin (look at his linkedin)

- Recently they have partnered with the Chinese government and a lot of new chinese company's. ( 2 examples: http://www.iwhcity.com/ and http://www.lantugis.com/)

- Confirmed by one of the team members: a listing on Bithumb and Upbit in coming days (2 biggest Korean exchanges). 

- Lot of marketing planned in the week before main net launch

Hey guys this is a new token named StrikeCoin (**$STRIKE**). It has been released recently and the team behind it are developing a blockchain powered Trading/Investment platform called TradeStrike. The unique selling point of this token means there is a huge ceiling for the value to rise, imagine thousands of asset-based transactions a day and ALL of them processed via Strike! Think about the value of BNB in terms of Binance to compare it to.

A blockchain powered brokerage will allow for tokenisation of ALL assets, including; Stocks, Crypto, NFT’s and even real estate. Expansion into brokerages that offer multiple different equities is the natural next step.

There is a high demand for a fair and ethical trading platform, as online trading platforms are experiencing exponential growth and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. Below are some key points with the strides STRIKE has made in the early stages. The coin is listed on CMC so it has a backbone to it and they developers have received an offer from WhiteBit, for which they are currently fundraising for.

Key Points of Strike:

\- 900m Supply, 101m coins burnt trending , 249m time-locked

\- 73.4% liquidity locked

\- Great Supply Structure strong hands strong hands strong hands

\- Growing community, cheap and low market cap

\- 3500+ holders

\- Updated Whitepaper (see below)

Competitors:

The number of available brokerages in the UK is extremely limited. The main competitors are Trading212, IBKR, eToro. As many have seen there are complaints about all of these trading platforms.

T212 - restricting OTC buys, slow execution, no afterhours

IBKR - UI & app not user-friendly

eToro - no OTC stocks, slow execution, no AH

Users are seen to be continuously complaining about wanting to leave these platforms but cannot do so because of the lack of options. This can be seen throughout social media, app store reviews and communities.

144,2021-04-17,"Trias 5m marketcap gem!I called Mtv in here at a 4m marketcap it went as high as 70m in under 30 days.

My next gem is Trias:

$TRIAS a sleeping giant thats about to wake up

$TRIAS is a sleeping giant thats about to wake up with its current market cap of around 5m and in Kucoin which is one of the major exchanges. It has no reason to be in Kucoin with its current market cap, the reason for this is it seems one of the executive in kucoin is advisor for trias.

It seems this project from China has been in development for more than 3 years and now its gaining traction after their token redomination.

Below is from their one pager

Trias in a Nutshell
Feb 22.2020

TRIAS(Trustworthy and Reliable Intelligent Autonomous Systems)

Trias is a Full-stack decentralized trusted cloud infrastructure and ecosystem for all-scale, general-purpose, and enterprise-ready applications. With a fine and delicate design, a talented and solid team with top-norch academic and industrial background, a complex of enterprise products and solutions, and a sophisticated and sustainable token economy, Trias is fueling industrial clients' innovation globally.

Vision

Trias aims to solve the core 'Trust Issues'. With Trias, we can root trust into machines with a firm assurance that the machines will deterministically “do what they are told to do”.

Team

Dr. Anbang Ruan, Founder of Trias, has got his Ph.D degree in Computer Security from the University of Oxford. He has research experience extensively in Trusted computing, Cloud Security and Cryptography for more than 12 years. He has published more than 20 academic papers including 2 IEEE transactions.

The core members of the team graduated from Oxford, London School of Economics, Peking University, Tsinghua University and other top universities; served in China Aerospace, Royal Bank of Canada, Intel, Oracle, Alibaba with strong technical strength and rich working experience.

Architecture

Trias is composed of three layers: Leviatom, Prometh and MagCarta.

Leviatom is an integration of Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) and Heterogeneous Consensus Graph, a graph computing algorithm similar to Hashgraph or DAGs. It can serve as the underlying '-1 layer' for other public chains, including Ethereum and Hyperledger.

Prometh is a combination of formal verification and DevSecOps methodologies to achieve traceable and verifiable general-purpose software development.

MagCarta is a consensus-oriented programming paradigm to achieve embed and self-defined consensus strategy for high-order enterprise DApps.

 MEMESTOKEN $MEMES

AUDITED and DEV DOXXED !

We are building a fully Decentralized Marketplace ,social platform/network that allows meme creators to get revenue for their work. Seeing the rise of the blockchain NFTs and the lack of specialized platform for memes, we thought about making this community-centric meme hub, in a totally decentralized fashion.

Our aim is to integrate all of the meme ecosystem into a unified blockchain protocol, which will make sharing and interacting with the platform as transparent and easy as possible.

App & marketplace launching in May, $MEMES token has lots of potential to become something very big!

I decided to think of what’s a common problem and Crypto and I immediately think of security.

Looking for security/compliance related projects I came across Findora, a L1 Solution that’s building products aimed at providing safety to the entire industry as a whole.

To keep it brief, the biggest product they’ve released is [their Triple Masking SDK](https://crypto.news/findora-launches-a-privacy-preserving-solution-for-web3-compliance/), It’s a solution that provides customizable privacy options for DApps while ensuring auditability for compliance with regulatory bodies. It offers scalability and interoperability, making it an attractive choice for devs who want to build privacy-oriented DApps without sacrificing compliance. As the crypto space grows, it's becoming increasingly important to address regulatory compliance.

153,2021-04-01,"Banano, I know it sounds funny because it is, but seriously, you should check out Banano.Hey everyone, I have been in the crypto space since 2017, like a lot of people here. I remember in 2017 feeling overwhelmed and finding it hard to learn about  cryptos. I made some bad choices, especially for someone who had money to spend. I lost a significant sum of money to a project called PO.ET, which at the time seemed like one of the most legitimate projects in this space. I lost a little bit of money to Unikoin Gold (which was being backed by Mark Cuban), I watched our biggest exchange in Canada exit scam. So needless to say I have seen some stuff happen.

 I have been in quite a few communities and know how toxic and overwhelming they can sometimes be. This is why I would like to take a few minutes of your time to introduce you to Banano and their fun community. 

Banano is a crypto currency which is a fork of Nano (you know the fast, feeless, instant one that everyone rants about in here), so you get to enjoy those same fast and feeless transactions with a potassium injection. This makes Banano fun to experiment with, because one Banano is always one Banano. You could create two wallets and send it back and forth all day long if you really want. 

Speaking of creating wallets, members of the Banano community have created some of the best wallets in this space. My absolute favorite is Kalium. It is available for Android and IOS through the app stores. Every wallet gets its own unique digital monkey and all the QR codes are outlined to look like a monkey head. The wallet is truly a great user experience. Fun fact for you, Kalium was created before Nano's Natrium wallet and the devs contribute to both projects. 

""The largest communities always win"" 
- u/hc6612 and maybe someone else

The Banano community is growing very fast. Their Reddit is almost 12,000 monkeys and their discord has over 22,000 apes! The discord is an absolute blast and a great space to learn about the technicals, development, and just in general hang out and make friends. An added perk is it often rains Bananos in the discord and an ungodly amount of tipping sometimes takes place in there, why not go hang out and maybe get some free Banano for just contributing to the community. 

 Please remember at the time of writing, Banano is ranked 822 on coin market cap. Banano already has a top 50 community, we just don't have the top 50 liquidity/exchanges, but it will eventually come, which leads me to my next point. 

Investing in Banano feels like you are a retired founder of a successful business. I get to make jokes and memes, bug the staff and not care about what's actually going on during the day to day. While I'm out at the golf course swinging around my big banano stick, the devs are working their butts off trying to get listed on bigger exchanges, improving the network and doing all the heavy lifting. All I care about is having a laugh and hopefully making more money than last year. Banano has a capped total supply, which gives it a store of value aspect, and hopefully price appreciation.

Don't want to invest but still want Bananos? Where there's a will there's a way! 

If you have a computer, you can dedicate it to a program called fold at home and earn Bananos for folding proteins. That's right, Bananos form of ""mining"" is dedicating your computer power to scientific research. I know you thought it couldn't get any better, but it did. 

Overall, Banano seems like a great place for people new to this space. It's a fun community, that actually has an amazing crypto and at the end of the day we all just might make some money.

***AMA / VC recap December 14th***

**Introduction**

Since  2 months the NSFW project moved from crypto hype project to a  data-driven company. We hired 15+ staff members and since then we have  raised enough capital to build the plan we have. We are a super  well-funded startup now. This is so huge and important as we can  revolutionize the industry despite crypto movements or volume.

 **Live events**  
We had our first Nifty Party at Tim’s place in the Netherlands last Saturday love

 **New Token Website**  
Will be live within 48 hours - [https://nsfwpay.com](https://nsfwpay.com/)

 **Staking Rewards**  
\- Will be live probably next week, need to get security audit back before we want to launch  
\- We will begin with 4 & 12 week fixed staking with BNB as rewards  
\- The earned BNB can be unlocked every week and we will drop special NFTs to 12 week holders (we will announce details soon)

 **CEX listing**  
\- Waiting for 1 more legal document.. lovelovelovelove  
\- Nice step for our strategy to become generally available to more people (also the less crypto/PCS savvy users)

 **Tokenomics change (due to staking and CEX listing)**  
Changed the tax from 10% to a sexy 6,9% tax  
\- 2% Staking rewards  
\- 1% Liquidity Pool  
\- 3,9% Marketing & Development  
\- No more automatic burn  
\- No more reflections

 **Nudes for charity**  
\-  For Tim’s action there will be an extra unlockable: Exclusive entrance  ticket for our Caribbean VIP weekend trip next year (if the covid  situation allows it)!!

**Roadmap December**  
\- Community Staking Pools  
\- CEX Listing

**Roadmap Q1-Q2 ’22**  
\- Our first algorithmic NFT collection  
\- Another CEX listing  
\- Pleasurely Beta release  
\- NFT marketplace Web 3.0  
\- Game with $NSFW as currency

Over $380,000 has been donated to charity so far, with a market cap of under 6M. they made crypto history when Butter became the first BEP-20 token to partner with a major food charity: Food For Life Global  https://ffl.org/20077/cryptocurrency-butter-token/

The liquidity for both the Milk and Butter tokens is locked away until 2022, and the team committed during a live AMA to  relocking the LP when the time expires. The Market caps are still low with a solid base. They're building our community for healthy growth, and have been continuously developing this project with  exciting use cases in the works. They already have NFTs, free just for casting your weekly vote.

Each week the Milk and Butter token team hosts AMAs with the Developer on Twitch where the community can ask any questions they may have. Occasionally, they have guests, last week the CEO of “Food For Life Global” joined them and explained the amazing genesis of “Food for Life Global” and took viewer questions. https://www.twitch.tv/milkbuttertoken

Accomplishments so far: 
•Code built from the ground up to develop both tokens.
•Unique staking and voting systems implemented.
$380,000 donated to various charities in the first 2 months
•Official global charity partnership with “Food For Life Global” being the first of many. 
•Milk has been audited with Butter audit on the way
•The team is fully [doxxed](MilkToken.net/#team)

Billions of trees are cut down every year. That's about 2,000 since you started reading this sentence.

Every time BlossomCoin is bought or sold, a portion goes to our charity wallet. The value of this wallet (up to 0.5% of current market cap) will then be donated to tree planters of the world every month.

Tokenomics:

 30% of original supply burned

 5% distributed to holders per transaction

 5% burned per transaction

 1% donated to planting trees per transaction

This has been going crazy today, they're trending at #2 on CMC this week, and CoinMarketCap just tweeted about them being in the top 10 most searched coins!!

They've just done their first weekly donation of $5k to charity, and will be doing their next one later tonight! Devs have also just announced on their website that they'll be doxing soon!

They're already listed on CoinGecko and CMC (less than 3 days after launch), and the Telegram community is legit - everyone's really invested and can see this is a long-term project for the greater good.

The dev team are really responsive and have been answering loads of questions in the Telegram, they've got a full team behind them of developers, graphic designers, web devs and have already begun the audit process - super legit.

Recent concerns about BTC energy usage is gonna send green cryptos parabolic, and this is looking like the best one so far! The roadmap on their website is solid and aggressive, with listings on all major exchanges in the line-up - the devs are clearly in this for the long run.

Check out the whitepaper on their website, it shows a unique and ambitious plan for the token, you can tell how serious the team behind this are!

The site looks slick, you can tell the team behind it are absolutely dedicated to this project and know what they're doing - this is gonna go crazy so get in whilst it's early!

164,2022-08-01,"How to Buy Bitcoin AnonymouslyToday, most countries of the world provide an opportunity for people to purchase and sell Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies for a profit with almost no restrictions. Despite this, the probability that Bitcoin may be banned in any country is increasing day by day. 

These events give crypto traders serious reasons for concern and make the anonymity of investments and trading in Bitcoin one of the most urgent.

In addition to the risk of losing the opportunity to carry out trading operations with Bitcoin in their own country, for many the issue of protecting their savings from tax authorities for personal reasons is also important.

The question concerning how to buy Bitcoin anonymously is asked by people who do not want to disclose their personal data when making transactions.

Using the no KYC Crypton Exchange

Crypton Exchange is a no KYC exchange that is part of the decentralized Utopia P2P ecosystem. It is a platform free from surveillance, censorship, and hacker data leaks. It offers built-in tools for messaging, data transfer, browsing, online payments, mining, etc.

Crypton Exchange is a secure online platform for buying, selling, exchanging, and withdrawing available cryptocurrencies. Registration and the use of the exchange are anonymous and do not require the entry of personal data.

It is a digital offshore that provides anonymous financial transactions. In addition, the platform does not cooperate with other centralized platforms or government agencies, which makes it one of the most independent and private exchanges.

The exchange functions perfectly worldwide and is not afraid of possible blocks by individual countries. Moreover, even if the exchange domain is blocked, it will still be accessible through the ecosystem (one of the advantages of decentralization.)

In addition, Crypton Exchange offers the lowest fees for financial transactions and comprehensive support by a strong Utopia community.

The exchange supports the purchase and sale of several cryptocurrencies:

* Crypton (CRP) is a privacy coin of the ecosystem and its main financial unit
* UUSD is the first stablecoin of the ecosystem
* Monero (XMR) is a popular privacy coin
* Bitcoin (BTC) is an anonymous cryptocurrency

There has been much community overlap since the beginning, with many Shib holders being early investors in RBIF. At first the Shib army was resistant and dismissive, then they began to get scared, issuing permabans in groups to anyone who even mentioned RBIF. 

But now they are truly panicking as droves of holders are diversifying their portfolios into RBIF after learning of this week’s coming 1% total supply burn and watching last night’s Dev Round Table with The Sandstorm.

168,2021-09-06,"UltraSafe: Exclusive Rubic promotion, 2 new partnerships, D.C. plus so much more**The Story So Far**

UltraSafe, 118 days old, 300 trillion tokens burnt, Queen of BSC, Breaker of Records, Bringer of Safety, and Mother of Reflections. It has been a bullish month for UltraSafe, which has seen its market cap more than double since August 4th. For HODLers, this growth comes as no surprise, with UltraSafe now offering ULTRA-BNB LP staking, boasting the likes of Rashad Evans and Daniel Cormier as celebrity ambassadors, and having added industry professionals Zachari M. T. ‘Ƶatoshi’ Saltmer (Strategic Advisor) and Kevin Upton (Chief Technical Officer) to the team. The good news for those not yet HODLing UltraSafe is that these developments are just the beginning.

**Ƶatoshi and the Giant Peachfolio** 

In early August, Ƶatoshi dropped into the UltraSafe Telegram chat to tease the community with a clue about an upcoming partnership. The image he posted was that of a safe, a single peach imposed on its door, along with the message “$ULTRA and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ coming together on the 28th! They see our potential, they know what we have coming”. Speculation ran rampant. Now, the community has its answer.

The latest project to partner with UltraSafe is Peachfolio, an APP which allows users to track every BSC token in their portfolio, add unlimited wallets and gain insights into the biggest DeFi gainers and losers. Included in their partnership with UltraSafe will be an exclusive reflections tracker, allowing HODLers to monitor how much ULTRA is being added to their wallet in real time.

**UFC’s Daniel Cormier Weighs In**

Hyped to see UltraSafe hitting milestone after milestone, UltraSafe ambassador Daniel Cormier (UFC Light Heavyweight and Heavyweight Champion) has shared his bullish sentiment on the project with his Instagram followers: “Crypto & UltraSafe are here to stay! When I joined the team, they assured me that there were big future plans in place for UltraSafe;, now I’m excited to share UltraSafe’s future plans for the ULTRA PROTOCOL. It’s gonna be its OWN ECOSYSTEM and will move out of what you guys call the ‘shitcoin’ space.” \[[Source](https://www.instagram.com/p/CTDO51uhwL9/?utm_medium=copy_link)\] Cormier also highlights an important aspect of UltraSafe’s mission when mentioning the “shitcoin space”. One of the founding principles of the project, as the developers often highlight, is that UltraSafe and other projects should provide investors with the knowledge to make informed decisions and protect themselves in the world of crypto. This is something that UltraSafe will address through the integration of an educational platform into its V4 website.

**RUBIC x ULTRASAFE**

The announcements just don’t stop in our community. This week, Rubic announced that their cross chain feature is NOW LIVE. You can now use Rubic widget to purchase Ultrasafe using ETH and MATIC, simply connect your wallet and press swap!

Rubic are also running a promotion, up until September 13th EVERYBODY who buys UltraSafe using the Rubic widget at Ultrasafe.finance gets their gas fees refunded!

**Scan DeFi**

Do you want another announcement? This week we announced our newest partner, Scan Defi. Just like us, they have taken on the immense FIGHT against scammers in Cryptocurrency as we all struggle towards the goal of making this a safer space.  

Their software allows users to obtain a full report of a project, detecting fraudulent contracts and providing education and knowledge to allow users to find these red flags for themselves. We are so excited about this awesome partnership! This just brings us even closer to our goal of changing the crypto game for the better.  

**The Shape of Things to Come**

* Zero-service fee NFT Marketplace
* Merch store
* Purchasing via direct debit and credit
* V4 website
* Ultra Protocol

**Win Some UltraSafe!**

Games and competitions are usually hosted weekly via Telegram in the UltraSafe Community Game Lounge. Previous competitions have seen winners add upwards of 30 billion UltraSafe to their stack. Feel free to join for a chance to win, but please note that only holders of at least 1 billion UltraSafe are eligible to collect prizes.

169,2021-04-29,"$MILK and $BUTTER token are working to break new ground in the era of mainstream cryptocurrency by introducing the general public to crypto through charity partnerships.These tokens allow those who aren’t familiar with the crypto space to continue supporting their favorite charities while also investing in themselves!
https://youtu.be/SaocbsBLWdc

We have already secured one partner (Food For Life Global) and have meetings scheduled with two more, Action Against Hunger and Feeding America, this week to discuss partnerships!

Milk and Butter tokens, for those that haven’t heard, are companion tokens in the Binance Smart Chain with an emphasis on charity giving. Milk is an RFI token that can be staked to generate Butter, which is used to power community voting for their favorite charities on a weekly basis. Those that merely wish to vote may purchase Butter tokens on the open market as well, which also drives rewards for those that stake Milk! 
https://www.milktoken.net/voting.html

5% of all Milk transactions are guaranteed to go to a charity wallet. In addition, Butter can be used to suggest new charities.
https://www.milktoken.net/suggest.html

$20,000 has been donated to charity so far, with a market cap of only 800K. We made crypto history when Butter became the first BEP-20 token to partner with a major food charity: Food For Life Global  https://ffl.org/20077/cryptocurrency-butter-token/

The liquidity for both the Milk and Butter tokens is locked away until 2022, at which point both will be relocked. Our Market cap is still low with a solid base, we're building our community for healthy growth, and we’ll continue to develop this project with many exciting use cases plus a full array of features to be rolled out as development completes.

Each week the Milk and Butter token team hosts AMAs with the Developer on Twitch where the community can ask any questions they may have. Occasionally, we have guests, last week the CEO of “Food For Life Global” joined us and explained the amazing genesis of “Food for Life Global” and took viewer questions. https://www.twitch.tv/milkbuttertoken

Roadmap: 
•The first NFTs for voting are releasing today!
•Next week gamification of Butter begins with lotto/bingo games being implemented.
•The voting and staking processes will continue to be refined to make the experience as easy and accessible as possible.
•Planned instructional content to help those new to crypto learn about the space and how to purchase and use the Milk and Butter tokens.

Accomplishments so far: 
•Code built from the ground up to develop both tokens.
•Unique staking and voting systems implemented.
$20,000 donated to various charities in the first month.
•Official global charity partnership with “Food For Life Global” being the first of many. 
•Milk has been [audited](https://dessertswap.finance/audits/Milk%20Token%20BEP-20%20Audit%206361622.pdf) with Butter audit on the way
•The developer is [doxxed ](https://christianclaypool.wordpress.com/about/)
•Milk and Butter LLC is established with full team being doxxed next week.

170,2021-04-13,"Yield Farming meta-level solutionYield farming is:

A) a whale game where you need to figure when to dump before the others  
B) causing small projects to be dumped close to zero

The classic ‘they come, they eat, they leave’. Naturally, it is a good thing when a project is not anything special — bad projects don’t deserve long-term price appreciation. Yet, we’ve seen projects with extremely high-quality development and technology being dumped in the beginning and then rise from the ashes. They are now solving these problems even if the token price during early days dumped to close to $300K market cap.

Here we go, let’s fix the problems:

Tokens represent governance. One governance token governs one ecosystem, right? For example, SushiSwap governance happens through SUSHI tokens. If you want to be part of several communities and make your vote matter, you need many different tokens…

But what if you could own a governance token that was governing 10 or 100 projects at the time? As farming gives you governance token rewards, you will dump that token on the market for ETH.

What if there was a platform that would:

A) reward you in ETH  
B) execute governance token to be bought from the market and distributed to you, IF you chose to take your rewards in the governance token instead of ETH?  
C) Incentivized no dumping of the governance token, and was built only on solid ‘pumpamentals’.

Dracula Protocol does this. When you have different LP-tokens from several other farming projects Dracula gives you the option to stake them on its native platform. It then farms your tokens and automatically sells the “victim” governance tokens to the market for ETH, keeping just a tiny portion of the “victims” governance token in Dracula’s vault — we will come back to the vault part in a moment.

[V2 Scheme](https://preview.redd.it/jl7ghi7uq0t61.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c928db13528ab9101d9e22eb2fe554e186c328a3)

[V1 Scheme](https://preview.redd.it/l3yvc69wq0t61.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4003b927a132c28bd28c261241d7530fa7309961)

&#x200B;

Now, the ETH rewards then get automatically compounded with ETH staking on a trusted platform such as AAVE, so the rewards get another boost. In plain English: Growth for everybody instead of just the whales. When you decide to harvest your rewards, you either choose to receive all that ETH, or if you choose to receive it in Dracula governance token DRC, the code automatically buys DRC from the market and distributes DRC to you.

But why would you want to receive the governance token?

The vault now holds governance tokens from other protocols. Let’s say Dracula would have 2% of all circulating tokens of SUSHI in its vault. If you then hold DRC, you are holding tokens with 2% voting power in SUSHI governance. Dracula will delegate the voting power from its partners to DRC holders. While you stake your DRC on Dracula, you will also be receiving a small portion of all ETH rewards piled on the platform. Like a structured note.

Dracula save you money on gas fees by harvesting and selling underlying rewards into ETH for you automatically. These fees are paid using a portion of the revenue from everyone's yields so that it is essentially crowdfunding the costs and lowering the overall average cost per user. In staking, users save money through the automation of compounding yields and crowdfunding gas costs. The entire protocol is governed by the DRC token, which can also be staked to earn a percentage of all yields from underlying platforms.

V2 launches this April. V1 already exists for 6+ months.

171,2024-07-04,"My take on $kenduLet’s get right to it: I'm a seasoned player in the crypto space, having been active since 2016. I've navigated the ups and downs, forged connections with DeFi whales, VCs, and influencers, and learned one crucial lesson: it’s not about utility. This cycle, memes are king. Last cycle, NFTs captured the market's imagination because they were accessible. This time, it’s memes that are outperforming and drawing in retail investors.

Kendu Inu is set to be the star of this cycle. Here's why you should pay attention:

Recent Achievements and Developments:

• Massive Market Cap Growth: Kendu Inu has surged to a $250M market cap, demonstrating its strong performance and market confidence.

• Major Media Features: We’ve been featured in Shiba Magazine, highlighting our significant impact and potential. Check out the article here: https://magazine.shib.io/article/665f5604dc89ea0001834eaf?woof=articles-5-edition-27#articles-5-edition-27

• Innovative Developments: Kendu Chads, a mysterious yet promising dApp where users can earn ETH, is almost complete. Details will be revealed soon.

• Exponential Holder Growth: We now boast 12k on-chain holders, doubling our numbers in just 25 days, excluding CEX holders.

• Widespread Exchange Listings: Kendu Inu is listed on 12 exchanges like bitmart, coinex and lbank, tier 1 exchanges coming soon.

• Product Expansion: Kendu Energy is a reality and will soon be available to the public, adding another layer to our ecosystem.

Why Kendu Inu?

• Stealth Launch and Fair Distribution: Kendu Inu had a stealth launch with no KOL allocations, backroom deals, or OTC transactions, ensuring a fair start for everyone.

• Strong Endorsements: Shytoshi Kusama, the project lead for Shiba Inu, followed Kendu from just 300 followers. He’s a top influencer in crypto, closely connected with our dev, and will play a significant role when market conditions are right.

• Proven Leadership: Our dev is a multi-millionaire with a track record of running successful projects, the last reaching over $400M. This is his magnum opus, with twice-daily community calls to engage and build with our community.

• Organic, Dedicated Community: Our community is strong, diverse, and zero-fud. We’ve attracted high-net-worth individuals, an A-list director and actor, DeFi whales, and more. Our supporters are die-hards, some even naming pets Kendu or getting Kendu tattoos. This is true organic growth and dedication.

Why Now is the Perfect Time:

The price has retraced 50% from its all-time high and is now bouncing off support. This is your chance to get in on a project with the potential for exponential growth. We’re not looking for exit liquidity; we’re building something monumental.

If you’re ready to be part of a game-changing movement, join us. Kendu Inu isn’t just a token; it’s a revolution. Together, we can make history.

Kendu Inu is the future. Don’t miss out on the opportunity to be part of this incredible journey.

177,2024-07-31,"What got me into Kendu and has kept me in Kendu a soon to be altcoinI have been in crypto since 2017. I made plenty of mistakes (round tripping coins, twice) and missed plenty of opportunities. One thing I was smart enough to avoid was memecoins, but that changed, April of 2024. 

I finally had a plan and had followed it with BTC and was waiting on my rebuy/next move. This plan came from years of watching videos and learning about crypto, in particular the BTC cycles. My crypto/meme arc is fascinating as I got rugged for one SOL- on my second meme- because I had IRL stuff going on for 90 minutes after token launch and figured I should be good. Best loss ever as it motivated myself to research and learn about the scum bag swamp of memecoins. I dug into reddit and followed the poster history/profile uncovering the whole aspect of paid services and paid upvotes to drive traffic. I might have gotten a little intense as I invited one of the posters offering paid services into a Telegram chat (I am not including the screenshots of those again) to learn even more. One funny thing is this human seemed to think I wanted money or something.



When that learning and research ended is when I got introduced to KENDU. I was in a Telegram with some of the ‘victims’ and one of them suggested Kendu. I put victims in quotes because so many people are desperate for a quick buck while another portion of people just enjoy gambling. I do not in this regard. The casino is always open and someone is always waiting to steal your money. Trust me for 99% of us the house always wins, but  Kendu is the anti casino and a safe bet that allows me to sleep at night. 



One thing that attracted me to Kendu is the ethos highlighted the lessons I had learned about investing while at the same time reinforcing the values I picked up in my crypto/meme arc (Don't pay for anything, pic a horse and stick with it, stick to the plan, etc.), BUT the concept of working for my bag was revolutionary to me. Feeling like I have some power in this was a liberating feeling that I have really taken to.



It wasn't long after finishing more research on KENDU, asking questions, and listening to everything I could that I pivoted my plan to center it around KENDU. I haven't looked back and love the community and work I have put in! If you want a deep dive into the community here is what I posted a couple days ago best way is to come in the TG and see it for yourself): https://www.reddit.com/r/KenduInu\_Ecosystem/comments/1eeq1v2/kendu\_community\_updated\_info\_journal/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button



With less than 24 hours to the Kendu Chads timer hitting zero and presumably the release of said dApp, this is a really cool moment for me. I have been called a bot and all types of scam-centric words, but this release will be my affirmation of a choice well made. I don’t know if the price will go up or down, but it doesn’t matter as this feature seems guaranteed to provide some real Utility in ‘earning cold hard ETH’ and it means I didn’t larp for upvotes or to increase my karma. I researched and listened and learned and I was correct to trust what I found and what I believed. I also know that the community will keep working and that Miazaki is built very different. He has said many things in the Spaces and they are all very real and come to fruition. It is not too late to do research and check out our Telegram. This cycle will heat up again for the real bull run and Kendu is already primed to take full advantage of that with the first aspect of the Ecosystem releasing and a ravenous and hard working community tearing up socials everyday. I believe everyone should have some exposure (hopefully to the tune of 5 million Kendu) to Kendu, but this isn’t financial advice. This is a call to do your own research! This is my real reddit account and will still be my real account when this crypto cycle is over.

https://preview.redd.it/mzxannm7dvfd1.png?width=2304&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d94d67218003b7335f5519f3244da2caab94252

TLDR: I have stayed in Kendu (on ETH…happy belated birthday) because of the community, OG developer experience and skill, vast connections, potential, road map (Ecosystem not a memecoin with a glass ceiling to its potential), and dare I say fun.

179,2021-06-09,"$SGE (Society of Galactic Exploration) SPACE CRYPTO - Multple Exchanges, Audited, Doxxed, 5600+ holders - Chico Crypto YT VID TMR!SGE features: A deep space astrophotography NFT platform, an iOS/Android remote controlled telescope app, and a cryptocurrency auditing division.

&#x200B;

\- Over 5500 holders

\- Tokenomics: 100 trillion supply, with burn capped at 70 trillion tokens (40 trillion burned on day one)

8% tax per transaction, 2% goes to redistribution, 1% burn, 5% marketing and dev wallet (of which 30% is injected as liquidity, 20% goes to marketing and 50% funds development)

\- Registered as an LLC (SGE LLC) in Michigan, USA

&#x200B;

What is SGE? There are 3 major components to SGE. 1) An NFT platform for space photography (astrophotography) 2) An iOS and Android app to remote control deep space telescopes to mint your own NFTs, where you pay for time with SGE tokens and 3) sgechain blockchain auditing division for new cryptocurrency projects - this is unique as there are no real auditing services with a doxxed team. Ankur Shah is the chief auditor who is the CEO of Erience Solutions in New York. The first audit has been completed! This auditing service is poised to set a new benchmark in crypto auditing with in-depth analysis of the audited contract. 

&#x200B;

\-The team behind SGE is fully doxxed and there is a great Telegram community involved with the project. The project is audited by [solidity.finance](https://solidity.finance) with a perfect score: [https://solidity.finance/audits/SGE/](https://solidity.finance/audits/SGE/) In the future, a set portion of the dev/marketing fund will be used to send kids in the United States to Space Camp and for STEM bursaries to support education in the STEM field.. 

&#x200B;

SGE also has a partnership with Blockchain App Factory whom are assisting in producing our NFT Platform which will be live later this week.

In April, a partnership with Down Under Observatory in Colorado USA was made. Down Under is ran by Terry Hancock who is a NASA affiliated astrophotographer and will be providing NFT's for the platform.

&#x200B;

SGE has obtained a partnership with crypto influencer Crypto Wendy O and has brought her on in an advisory role. This week, a dedicated social media manager has been brought on to help promote SGE via the social media channels.SGE has an official WSB facebook partnership.

**SGE Design Team is also working on a potential partnership with Tom's Shoes.**

&#x200B;

***In addition tomorrow we'll get a youtube video from Chico Crypto (250k subs) !!***

&#x200B;

The team is also working with other youtubers and influencers to push out the word about SGE. Some of these are already confirmed and scheduled for the near future.

180,2021-05-02,"$MILK and $BUTTER token are working to break new ground in the era of mainstream cryptocurrency by introducing the general public to crypto through charity partnerships.These tokens allow those who aren’t familiar with the crypto space to continue supporting their favorite charities while also investing in themselves!
https://youtu.be/SaocbsBLWdc

We have already secured one partner (Food For Life Global) and are in talks with two more major food charities to partner.

Milk and Butter tokens, for those that haven’t heard, are companion tokens in the Binance Smart Chain with an emphasis on charity giving. Milk is an RFI token that can be staked to generate Butter, which is used to power community voting for their favorite charities on a weekly basis. Those that merely wish to vote may purchase Butter tokens on the open market as well, which also drives rewards for those that stake Milk! 
https://www.milktoken.net/voting.html

5% of all Milk transactions are guaranteed to go to a charity wallet. In addition, Butter can be used to suggest new charities.
https://www.milktoken.net/suggest.html

$25,000 has been donated to charity so far, with a market cap of only 800K. We made crypto history when Butter became the first BEP-20 token to partner with a major food charity: Food For Life Global  https://ffl.org/20077/cryptocurrency-butter-token/

The liquidity for both the Milk and Butter tokens is locked away until 2022, at which point both will be relocked. Our Market cap is still low with a solid base, we're building our community for healthy growth, and we’ll continue to develop this project with many exciting use cases plus a full array of features to be rolled out as development completes.

Each week the Milk and Butter token team hosts AMAs with the Developer on Twitch where the community can ask any questions they may have. Occasionally, we have guests, last week the CEO of “Food For Life Global” joined us and explained the amazing genesis of “Food for Life Global” and took viewer questions. Our next AMA is TONIGHT at 3am UTC https://www.twitch.tv/milkbuttertoken

Roadmap: 
•The first NFTs for voting are releasing this week!
•Next week gamification of Butter begins with lotto/bingo games being implemented.
•The voting and staking processes will continue to be refined to make the experience as easy and accessible as possible.
•Planned instructional content to help those new to crypto learn about the space and how to purchase and use the Milk and Butter tokens.

Accomplishments so far: 
•Code built from the ground up to develop both tokens.
•Unique staking and voting systems implemented.
$25,000 donated to various charities in the first month.
•Official global charity partnership with “Food For Life Global” being the first of many. 
•Milk has been [audited](https://dessertswap.finance/audits/Milk%20Token%20BEP-20%20Audit%206361622.pdf) with Butter audit on the way
•The developer is [doxxed ](https://christianclaypool.wordpress.com/about/)
•Milk and Butter LLC is established with full team being doxxed next week.

181,2024-01-09,"My Bullish Projects for 2024As we step into another exciting year for crypto, I can't help but feel the anticipation building up. With Bitcoin halving less than 100 days away and the potential for a Bitcoin ETF on the horizon, the stage is set for some thrilling developments.

I've been diving deep into various projects, and I wanted to share my perspective on what could be the blue chips for the upcoming bull run.

Real estate projects like [Parcl](https://app.parcl.co/) caught my attention. The intersection of crypto and real estate has incredible potential, and Parcl seems to be paving the way for innovative solutions.

Post-quantum cryptography is also gaining traction, and projects like [Qanplatform](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/qanplatform/) are at the forefront. Security is paramount in the crypto space, and investing in advanced cryptographic solutions could be a game-changer.

I can't possibly forget GambleFi projects like [Shuffle](https://shuffle.com/) that will bring a new dimension to the crypto space, adding an element of excitement to the ecosystem. 

Real-world assets (RWA) are also gaining prominence, and [Realio](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/realio-network/) seems to be making waves in this space. You'd agree with me that investing in projects tied to tangible assets provides a sense of stability amidst the crypto volatility.

I'd love to hear your thoughts and insights as well. What projects are you keeping an eye on as we gear up for the next bull run?",positive,0.75265557,62

I usually wouldn’t speculate on testnets but Venom has a lot of VC backing and seems to be the only regulatory compliant blockchain out there.


Just looking for thoughts on Venom in general and in case anyone needs help with the testnet quests I found [this great guide](https://cryptobullsclub.com/venom-testnet-guide/) that leads you thought the whole process.

* Second, automatic LP charges a 10% “tax” whenever someone exits the LP and sells their BARMY to prevent the collapse of token price when whales decide to sell. This 10% tax is divided into 4 portions:
   * 4% will be used to add liquidity for BARMY
   * 3% will be shared to the remaining holders
   * 2% will be burnt to reduce supply of BARMY
   * 1% will be given BSC Army members under Meme Bounty function

All those services are natively integrated on DeFiChain without adding any virtual machines or changing the nature of Bitcoin, to guarantee  the highest security. DeFiChain delivers DeFi-Applications as a default-feature. Changes can only be done if the whole community votes for it, instead of smaller teams reserving admin-rights that allows them to change important parameters.                            

And the best part about DeFiChain is that they're about to launch their $50,000 airdrop on Coinmarketcap, with each user being able to claim up to $230. Super easy tasks to, definitely one of the better airdrops that I've seen.

194,2024-07-28,"KENDU Community Updated Info JournalHere is a updated deep dive into a specific aspect about $KENDU , a meme built with a plan around a strong dev with experience and vision. THIS IS NFA, but merely sharing of my perspective on this project. I have been in the crypto space since 2017 and as of about 13 weeks ago I had avoided touching memes altogether. I had a plan, but it all got derailed when I kept digging and reading and looking at KENDU. Yes, I have a bag, but that doesn't mean I am trying to tell you to buy. I merely want to provide an avenue for you to see the facts and come to your own financial choice.

**Point: $KENDU is backed by a super strong community who create an infectious culture built around work and acceptance.** Take a look at the data below:

https://preview.redd.it/t8d8mkf8qdfd1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9254872b34d2101e2838699aa97dc7308daaced0

Kendu is constantly attracting new holders on DEXs (decentralized exchanges) and as far as I understand it, I am not able or capable of tracking how many holders we have on the 14 CEXs we are listed on. One of the reasons is that we are everywhere and people are using their skills to bring awareness about Kendu.

One Chad made an amazing Kendu Pendant:

People have been printing their own stickers and placing them anywhere and every to raise awareness:

We had people in NYC filming the billboard that was paid for by a very famous member of our community. Also people hanging flyers in cities from Boston to NYC to Australia.

Another member was promoting Kendu from a historic fountain in Denmark.

We had KENDU members go to the BTC Conference in Nashville this weekend! Chads and Chadettes have created all types of ways to spread the project.

We had a member who hosted a Kendu sponsored nightclub event in Kolkata India

https://preview.redd.it/g9bjukkdqdfd1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=8da25c247f2ae3486c53bb5dd9e4c7b6745f4ad0

I want to share some information about the community in the form of some examples/stories to give outsiders the facts and I guess to encourage you to DYOR and at least come into the Telegram (9901 members strong). Remember that coming into the TG is like a free test drive with no strings attached of your favorite uber expensive sports car like a Lamborghini, or Buggati. That is a huge opportunity.

I lurked in the community for about a week or two before buying in and was posting a bit here and there with questions from time to time. One night I decided to take it to the next level of participation and hop into the voice chat to ask a question. I have no problem admitting that my question felt a bit silly and random, especially considering that I wasn't sure if the VC was for planning next moves, hanging out, high level business like meetings for those on the inside, etc. My innocuous question was met with kindness and actual answers. NOTE: I was curious about the KENDU INU bike helmet ( Hey, chill I needed a new bike helmet so my kids didn't call me out on my clear hypocrisy. Why not support my most important investment). I bought it by the way from the Merch store that was started by a community member around 1 million MC. The dev doesn't have time for that and gives us freedom to use our skills and use the brand!

IF you are still reading this, that might be a miracle, but I have to share how welcome I felt. The fact that one of these Chads knew the answer about the specific item speaks volumes about the work ethic and care for this project and I ended up chatting a bit with the crew on VC. We talked about a couple things even meandering into the culture and community building that I know has been built in KENDU's chat and community. When I had to go I was actually encouraged to come back sometime and not be a stranger. Every time a new member comes into the community at least one or two people welcome them and address them in the TG. EVERYTIME, I have been watching and picking up on these little things. IT IS AN AMAZING THING YET....maybe not so amazing. Sometimes they talk right away sometimes they don’t no pressure.

I believe the people on the ground floor understand exactly what they are doing on so many levels, one of which being how to build community and a positive one at that. We are constantly evolving. I had a convo with someone a day or two ago on Reddit about something that happened where this Chad got banned after some unsavory interactions with members and I searched the chat to see that some divisive topics had been blacklisted from the chat after that situation. Maybe things weren't perfect, but I saw the response to some divisive content and that is important. Even just tonight I saw words added to the list of blacklisted wroding as it is not helping the mission. Crucial and important and we don't need to talk about that cuck engagement farmer. 

Every measure is done to protect the community. I have seen a couple moments where someone has been banned in chat. I don't see the spammed messages or any divisive commentary make it far at all and apparently some of this is done in real time manually. This is hugely important to keep the community laser focused over our shared goal of changing Defi and spreading awareness about a game changing Ecosystem. Of course making a fat pile of money is a goal too, but also to help us grow connected as humans that might just trust one another to each do their part, hold the line until the goal is reached. Trust is important!

The ""Kendu Loyalist"" crew leads from the top answering all questions and welcoming new people in a really genuine way. It is exceptional.

Alright last thing to mention is that the culture also is about organic unpaid growth:

https://preview.redd.it/epgd6f5fqdfd1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=bbe047d0c99d0f62b024e723fc635f9b8ffd9a6b

Notice the kindness and honesty from one of our Chad or Chadettes. Look how far KENDU has already risen with no paid nothing! This is the ethos and approach that is all over the chat and I believe it will stick no matter when we swell to 10K TG members. The point is that something big is growing here and it is beautiful and it makes me believe even more. Not to mention people are working constantly.

Some of the funnest and funniest moments are when someone has come into the TG as an influencer with a big head. Thinking they alone can help us. It usually starts with, “Nice project you have here.” and it is great to see. They get a bus ticket, but everyone also gets the reinforced ethos that we don’t pay for anything. There is no marketing budget. You want to pay for a billboard do it, you want to pay for a big CEX listing, do it.  Not so much if the person gets the hint, but if that self proclaimed influencer happens to be self centered…good luck!

To wrap things up with Point #2: I came back after about a day outside of chat to 7900 messages one day. Another day after sleeping cause everyone has to do it: 1433 messages. It is unreal the culture that has been built, so come check us out. You are witnessing a real deal project that you owe it to yourself to check out. You have been informed!

Of course have to mention the Kendu Chads timer is about 3 days and 10 hours left!!!! Utility/usecase/dApp/earn cold hard ETH/change Defi!!!!

Many people talk about utility and use cases in certain crypto subs and wanted to give an update on what I believe (yes I know the overwhelming feeling of many: scam, rug, blah blah blah. I did extensive research and reading before I bought in and none of this new stuff was available aside from a couple names. I believed early on that KENDU is going to be built with an ecosystem supporting it) will be a real utility though I am not sure if this counts. Curious to hear other's thoughts? Would this qualify KENDU as an Altcoin for you when this goes live?

Here is what was said: “KENDU chads is almost here…That is going to bring a lot of buy pressure to KENDU in general…cause you need KENDU to participate in earning some cold hard ETH essentially, right.” This post is aimed at informing those who have heard the name and questioned the legitimacy.

Milk and Butter tokens, for those that haven’t heard, are companion tokens in the Binance Smart Chain with an emphasis on charity giving. Milk is an RFI token that can be staked to generate Butter, which is used to power community voting for their favorite charities on a weekly basis. Those that merely wish to vote may purchase Butter tokens on the open market as well, which also drives rewards for those that stake Milk! 

[https://www.milktoken.net/voting.html](https://www.milktoken.net/voting.html)

&#x200B;

5% of all Butter transactions are guaranteed to go to a charity wallet. In addition, Butter can be used to suggest new charities.

&#x200B;

$25,000 has been donated to charity so far, at a market cap of only 800K.

&#x200B;

The liquidity for both the Milk and Butter tokens is locked away until 2022, at which point both will be relocked. Our Market cap is still low with a solid base, we're building our community for healthy growth, and we’ll continue to develop this project with many exciting use cases plus a full array of features to be rolled out as development completes.

&#x200B;

Each week the Milk and Butter token team hosts AMAs with the Developer on Twitch where the community can ask any questions they may have. Occasionally, we have guests, last week the CEO of “Food For Life Global” joined us and explained the amazing genesis of “Food for Life Global” and took viewer questions.

205,2021-05-13,"The Genius Tokenomics of SLT (Smartlands)Many of you will be [familiar with Smartlands](https://www.reddit.com/r/SmartlandsPlatform/comments/mi8zgz/complete_explanation_of_smartlands/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) and their token SLT - you might have even caught one of the AMAs with the CEO and Chairman not too long ago (if not, you [should definitely check it out](https://www.reddit.com/r/AltStreetBets/comments/mpfjq3/smartlands_ama_please_ask_us_anything/))

CoinGecko link: [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/smartlands](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/smartlands)

You've probably heard a few people, including myself (a lot), going on about how the tokenomics of SLT are amazing. Genius-level even. Well, I'm here to explain to you why people say that.

This coming Friday 14th May (tomorrow), Smartlands are planning on formally announcing the first batch of property details for the new investment platform currently being rolled out ([smartlands.app](https://smartlands.app/)).

This is just the start too, they already have partnerships lined up for more real estate assets, SME assets, data centers and agricultural supply markets (see [smartlands.io](https://smartlands.io/) news section).

The **first four properties** alone make up **$29mil worth of tokenisation**, which we know they have been pre-marketing to their network of HNWI clients (the Chairman of Smartlands, Martin Birch, is an investment banker with a long career in investor sales and over a decade of experience in Ukraine where they are launching).

The Genius Tokenomics of SLT are as follows:

* Smartlands *has* to be paid in SLT (part of the protocol)
* Asset listers are given access to a buy bot that will convert their fiat into SLT by DCAing *on market*
* This is then distributed 2/3 to Smartlands and 1/3 to staking holders [through the fee pool](https://smartlands.io/blog/the-fee-pool-and-ukraine-explained/)
* Staking creates scarcity, which this buy bot will buy into
* This generates upward pressure on price
* which multiplies the revenue of Smartlands = more partnerships, marketing, staff, exchanges etc.
* cycle repeats

How much revenue for the fee pool would that $29mil be as a starting point *for the first month* that this wealth engine operates? Close to **$1.5mil** ($5k listing fee + 5% of tokenised amount commission)

$1.5mil with a current token price of roughly $15 means that **100,000 SLT will be bought on market** by the buy bot in the first month. The *total* supply at the moment is 5.1 million tokens.

$500,000 of that will then be distributed to SLT holders that are staking. The payout per SLT will vary depending on how many are staked... but it could easily mean that around 15-20c per SLT is provided in the first month of revenue sharing. Which would be about a 1% return (12% APY) for the first month, **paid out in SLT**.

...and that is just the beginning. Just the first assets of many, many more to come. That's even *before* we start adding **transaction fees** from **secondary markets** and **joint venture platforms** that use the Smartlands Network protocol.

Oh, and did I mention that SLT has often performed better than other alt coins during a down-swing (such as last night) and is [inherently bear market resistant](https://www.reddit.com/r/SmartlandsPlatform/comments/ly0bs3/slt_a_shield_against_a_bear_market/) as it is [facilitating a hybrid business model](https://www.reddit.com/r/SmartlandsPlatform/comments/mi8zgz/complete_explanation_of_smartlands/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) that is not exposed to the crypto markets?

If you want to remove any uncertainty from the equation, then ***you can wait*** until Friday/next week when the final details of all this are released and confirmed. Maybe there are more delays... we don't know. If you're worried about that then you can always wait a week or two and find out for sure. Feel free to wait until June if you don't want to take the risk before the engine is turned on.

...***or you could buy the f'ing dip*** (currently around 25% off ATH) and enjoy this wealth engine once it starts revving.",positive,0.8816462,60

Reaching 40-50 billion levels is achievable for Kendu, given strong sentiment and growing interest in the crypto market.

Kendu offers a safe bet with strong conviction for moonshot potential.

208,2023-04-28,"Anyone here got $VOLT before the 550% price surge?I've been following Voltage Finance for a little while, it's the main DEX on Fuse. Their goal is to offer DeFi tools while also offering their users the convenience of having an all-in-one application for their DeFi needs, whether it is trading, staking, yield farming, borrowing, etc. I think simplicity is the key to mainstream adoption that's why I'm betting big on $VOLT.

209,2021-12-20,"Zuna Coin DD (BSC 12M MC) Zuna is one of my favorite investment right now… here is some homework for you savvy investors, degenerates, apes, those too lazy to do DD, and those who just haven’t heard of it yet.

CMC Link -  [ZUNA price today, ZUNA to USD live, marketcap and chart | CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/zuna/) 

1. The team of developers are top notch. Doxxed, transparent, and do what they say they will. There is a reason I put this as number one, you generally don’t find this kind of team. The most impressive part is they are fronting their own cash. Marketing and initial liquidity pool funds were paid by the team, no presale, they are full on YOLO into this project. The money used to promote this coin comes from their pocket, not the sale of ZUNA. Developers have no interest in selling ZUNA to make money, and do not have massive holdings, they plan to make money on future platforms (NFT marketplace, exchange, ect.). Don’t believe me? Check out their YouTube channel and AMA videos.

[Devs](https://preview.redd.it/u79p9q1ltq681.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=4425e19c7fcf707fd95f7ddeaa8263167f9444a2)

2. Utility and meme combo. Zuna has some amazing projects upcoming, NFT collection is being launched next month which will raise additional funds for marketing. NFT marketplace and an exchange platform coming in the near future as well. The NFT collection is astronaut themed and will offer different “tiers”. This could be huge, having one of the original astronauts NFTs will give rewards plus future rewards when the marketplace is launched. You basically become a part owner of the NFT marketplace. 

3. Marketing. Did I mention they are paying for this? Oh yea I did, and they are also awesome at it. Facebook recently changed its policy on crypto advertising and the developers were all over it and started advertising on Facebook. The best part is there is a transparent plan laid out for the upcoming month on what advertisements will take place and this will continue  

[Dec Marketing Campaign](https://preview.redd.it/5o7t2bwmtq681.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=c70d8753ff7c8c3a4762777675f930b7a9dbfb12)

4. The market cap is roughly 12M….. HUGEEEEEE room for growth. Zuna deployer wallet is to be used for future burns and future exchanges. Do I need to say more? Nice dip from the ATH, so this is a very nice entry IMO, especially with a 100T burn that will happen any day. At 50k holders there will be one more 100T burn.

[Chart](https://preview.redd.it/ihrh5ftotq681.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=865d3be505e54aae8ef9743c1fb8c7572e7ddcf4)

5. Exchange listings coming soon (1-2 months, seems like January). Exchanges have been pursuing Zuna, no official announcement on which exchange but the Devs are not going to list on any exchange only ones they think will be a wise choice. Zuna is already rocking it on PancakeSwap, imagine when we start reaching more investors

6. 5% of every buy/sell transaction is distributed back to coin holders. This means as you HODL you earn more Zuna. Got diamond hands? Get even more gains. To make it even sweeter the burn address receives these rewards so less Zuna will be in circulation over time, increasingly adding to its value.

210,2021-11-16,"Important Information !!! for all new and semi new monkeys in the crypto world who are just in the red market and fear for the loss of their fortunesFirst things first! Do not worry, still the market crash is far away. Fear eats the soul!

Why should you read this? Because I'm one of the idiots who didn't follow up on his fiat transfer to MTGOX when Bitcoin was still at $0.0001. I sold Ethereum in 2017 at $6.5 with 80% loss.... But I think I have learned my lessons.

If you are still reading here now you probably invested a lot of time in the last weeks/months to find a crypto project you trust, or just bought every coin that had a fancy icon or great graphics and now it's going down 

These rules are absolutely only aimed at HODLER, my own rules and traders hopefully know exactly what they are doing.

Rule 1: Never sell at a loss, or you fail rule 2 already! Selling at a loss can only happen under three circumstances. You need, although there is rule 2, urgently fiat money, you have lost confidence in the project or there is news (never the charts) that force you to do so.

Rule 2: Never invest more than you are willing to lose. Should be clear to everyone, but most seem to hope that they do not lose everything and then quickly become nervous.

Rule 3: Have you found a project, done research, exchanged ideas in forums/chats and are convinced of it? ALL IN is the bad choice here. Think about how much you want to invest in this project, divide the sum by 5 and initially invest 1/5. Now look at the charts over weeks. Is the price permanently going up? Try to buy small dips with 2/5. Does the price go down? Preferably the whole market? Rule 4!

Rule 4: DCA Time, this is where the fun begins. You've held back an extra 2-3/5 for your investment. Now it starts, best to guess when the price is at the low and then buy! Freely after Baron Rothschild: ""Buy When There's Blood In The Streets, even it is your own!"". DCA is the best way to maximize your profits.

Rule 5: The most beautiful of the rules, now we make gains!!! Even if you believe in the project and swear ""HODL for Life strong handsstrong handsstrong hands"", always take a few wins on the way up. If only so you can re-buy on the next dip. I've gotten into the habit of 1/3 to 1/2 here. As long as I am well in the plus, always sell a little bit. Hold max. half, as long as I still have confidence in the project that it continues.

Rule 6: Exit strategy. Here everyone must decide for himself. Do I only want profit, or is it also about the project.

Rule 7: ℹℹℹStay informed, because information is the most important. Does the CEO change in an early project? DIP. Does the contract need to be migrated? DIP. Is the coin listed somewhere? PROFIT.

Rule 8: Stay relaxed. But you can only do that if you follow a long-term strategy and are well informed.

Rule 9: Do not fall for scammers! Be very careful with airdrops. If you participate, create a new wallet.

These are my rules, important for me. Who would like to add something, gladly.‼

&#x200B;

‼‼ No financial advice ‼‼

And now but one more brotip:

Who is already in memecoins, shitcoins, early project, look at  \[N$FW\]  from xxxNifty. Yes it is about adult content. But sex sells and the US market alone is $90 bil per year.

211,2021-07-18,"Staying safer in the altcoin arena : Why the likes of SAFERmoon’s Launchpad is essential.Crypto is risky right? In recent months we’ve seen a real upsurge in scams and rug-pulls- which does nothing for those new to the space or anyone who’s been robbed.

Creating a safer environment through innovative and positive project development is critical for all.

Imagine you are a developer deeply invested in an ecosystem. Trying to create pioneering projects that innovate and open up defi for new users as well as those who have been in the space for a while. You’ve been around a time, you’re respected.

Now imagine too, that all your genuine, hard work is often overshadowed by fly-by-night, unscrupulous folks who care little for the environment and what it could be and simply want to make personal gain at the expense – not only of investors – but the ecosystem they use to defraud them….

In a sea of sh*t and meme coins that threaten investors with rug pulls and scams, there are only a few (it seems) genuine projects trying to make a positive difference, both for investors but more importantly, for the ecosystem itself.

For every genuine project there are 10 with nefarious motives, threatening rugs or scams to defraud their investors – us, regardless of whether or not we are seasoned defi users. More than that though - it risks the integrity of the space in which it occurs and that is a black mark on the ecosystem, that has a fundamentally negative (and cumulatively so) effect on the likes of BSC or any blockchain. This is the opposite of what we want.

As the speed and accessibility of defi improves, opening it up to more users, so too will the scope for scammers increase. Indeed, since BSC is much cheaper than Ethereum, scammers have migrated over and there is a real need for safe projects. Safe not just in name but in deliverables too - to ensure the ecosystems in which they are built are trusted in the long term - otherwise there is the risk of the perceived integrity of those spaces being eroded.

I’m relatively new to crypto but this has become apparent very quickly and I have been extremely cautious in my approach (slow and steady) and I’m involved with a few projects with noble goals (by no means an assurance) - projects like SAFERmoon who aim to improve the space for all and are - to all intents and purposes - building positively. By allowing new projects (even those with no coding experience but a gem of an idea) to build their token on blocks of pre-audited and safe code, their tokens can be launched with greater trust – which benefits both the new project, investors and the ecosystem itself. But while noble is great, there has to be a benefit for us as investors and that comes from Utility. There are a raft of meme type coins - so investors who want to be a little safer, should definitely focus on utility. Hype can be infectious - but it can also be expensive if the potential scam is realised - tokens offering utility are more likely to be serious about the long term.

While SAFERmoon are promising their new project generator (it’s apparently almost finished) SAFERmoon have also been delivering for their holders. Repeatedly. Beyond reflections they have also offered 3 rounds of staking with other well respected BSC projects Blizzard Money and JetSwap Finance.

SAFERmoon is currently the only RFI token to allow fee-free staking (no 10% cost to stake and unstake as is the case with all other RFI tokens) while still receiving reflection rewards on transactions of the native token. In fact, they achieved that within 3 weeks of their inception. SAFERmoon holders have been making money during the current bearish run, while holders of other tokens give their investors the ability to buy branded sweatshirts and offer promises to lean on.

Ultimately new investors in meme-type coins are generally dragged along in marketing and swept-up in promises. My advice is to take a step back and look for utility and genuine goals - this is a pretty standard piece of advice for big crypto but seems to be overlooked or plain ignored in the altcoin arena - certainly lower down the list. There are great projects out there, you just need to be objective and the gems will present themselves. 

If it’s JUST hype / promises, be wary!

213,2021-05-05,"upBNB- the next game changer in defi$upBNB is the first BSC token in the upOnly ecosystem, from the developers of ROOTKIT and iFUND on ETH! 

(Credits to Ben in our community for the writeup below)

This token has revolutionary tokenomics, blowing away the deflationary tokens of the past. There are 2 main mechanisms that combine to make UpBNB go up over time.

#1: Buybacks.

upBNB uses strategic token buybacks to create upward momentum. Buybacks are funded using a new protocol, called ERC-31337, that lets the team re-use locked liquidity to make token purchases via the vault.

Learn more about ERC-31337: https://rootkitfinance.medium.com/the-power-of-a-price-floor-86fa74b59bd1

Additional funds from taxes on sales add to the buyback Vault, supercharging buyback power. Buybacks can happen at any time, whenever they are most needed and least expected. They happen again and again, and again - serving the best interests of holders. 

#2: Price Floor.

The ERC-31337 protocol also creates a price floor. Tokens from buybacks are burned, decreasing supply. Over 5% of original tokens have been burned in less than a week. As these tokens are destroyed, the locked liquidity pool stays the same size, creating a floor price that the token can't fall below. That means that unlike many tokens, $upBNB always retains value based on the base token (in this base BNB) and can't never go to zero. If you acquired tokens at the price floor, you literally CAN NOT LOSE. Liquidity below the price floor is recycled into MORE BUYBACKS, accelerating upward momentum.

The most exciting part is that the dev team has a plan to construct an entire upToken ecosystem, with ROOT as the governance token and upBNB as the hub token of future BSC upTokens.

Learn more about the ecosystem: https://rootkitfinance.medium.com/developing-the-uponly-ecosystem-4a538f121b8c

upBNB is designed for holders who believe in the value of the upEcosystem. The same technology on Eth, in the ROOT token, did over 25x and is climbing back to ALL TIME HIGHS 6 months later.

upBNB can be acquired on PancakeSwap V2, with 0.5%-1% slippage to buy. Sell slippage resets to 15% when a buyback occurs to prevent dumping, then gradually falls to around 7% over the course of 5 days.

This is a real project with a use case that is in it for the long term. I really can't say that for a lot of other projects in the BSC space right now. The token is about a month old and is still holding up strong with continued development from the team. They are focused on building a strong foundation behind this token.

The lead developer is doxed and the team has been established as a legal entity.

**There is a LIVE VIDEO AMA this Sunday with the fully doxed team!!! This is the 6th AMA..... yes the team is committed and not going nowhere!**

**The Dev actively communicates with the community and takes time to implement new features into the ecosystem based on community suggestions.**

**Some examples include:**

* Staking system custom coded to Churn Milk into Butter
* Integrated wallet on website to see token balance and monetary value
* Charity voting mechanism that is custom coded and built into the contract to suggest and vote for charities
* Many more to come in the coming weeks including NFT farming for members holding tokens, gamification, and lottery.

**Token Name: $BUTTER and $MILK**

**Liquidity Locked: On DxSale until 2022, then it will be relocked on UniCrypt**

**Token Specifics:**

* **5% Charity**  
5% of transactions using the Butter token are collected by the Butter Token contract and sold into BNB that is reserved to be collected by the Charity Wallet
* **2% Liquidity**  
The Butter Token contract takes 2% of every contract and locks those tokens into a liquidity pair to ensure it is always tradeable on Pancakeswap
* **2% Staking Rewards**  
Milk Holders who have staked their Milk in the Butter Churn earn 2% of every Butter transaction proportional to their share of the Milk staking pool
* **1% Expenses Fee**  
1% of Butter transactions are sold into BNB and reserved in the contract to be collected by an expenses wallet for use in marketing/promotion/business expenses related to the Milk and Butter tokens

The malicious actor that tried to damage (yes, tried, on the past) the network have spent huge sums of money on this attempt.  What got my attention, because... Why would someone spend huge sums of money trying to damage a ""dead"" project? Or even a bad one?

Usually, bad actors will endorse bad/scam/dead projects trying to grab money from the fools, not investing their own money on the attempt to hurt it.  So it makes me guess that this one attacker (person or group) could consider [\#Nano](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Nano?src=hashtag_click) a threat to him and his own malicious intentions.

A project that is considered a threat to some malicious player is definetely worth attention.  But the best part of all this, is that he/she/they did not succeed.  The network got a bit slow, thats true... And the team got to stand up and fight... Also true.

But some fights are worth fighting, and the entire [Nano](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24Nano&src=cashtag_click) community have proved they worth as fighters.  Updates on the protocol were fastly developed by and active team. Investors and users have kept their faith (and their coins, lol), surprisingly holding the price during one of the hardest threats to the project.

This event also made the price a lil sleepy. So, while [BTC](https://twitter.com/hashtag/BTC?src=hashtag_click) and other [\#altcoins](https://twitter.com/hashtag/altcoins?src=hashtag_click) were pumping, [Nano](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Nano?src=hashtag_click) have kept still. Creating an awesome buying opportunity!  Now, exchanges are back proceeding withdraws.

The spam attack is insignificant (it keeps happening) and transactions are close to get back to it's usual.  And the price just started moving again!  
Another thing that crosses my mind, is that the maliciou actor could also have a purpose to hold the price down so he/she/they could have more time to accumulate. Manipulating the market through a expensive attack.

If that's true, they are probably buying large sums of [$Nano](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24Nano&src=cashtag_click) in order to make it worth the first ""investment"".  And we also have a chance to punish he/she/they. By not letting the price going down.

UBI liquidity mining rewards ended in March 2022. This proposal to reinstate rewards, via xToken Terminal, would move liquidity to Uniswap V3 to facilitate deeper liquidity for the UBI DAO going forward. xToken Terminal provides a V2-like experience, abstracting many of the complexities of Uniswap V3.

Good day #RoboFamily,

As a role of developer, we always try to do things at the community’s interests. And today, we launch this airdrop, which only occurs when we hit *5,000 HOLDERS*.

We believe that the humanity of our own community is the law of attraction to $RBIF

As such, let’s work together with us the Dev Team as well as the marketing agents to spread the awareness about #RoboInu. Let’s put our hands together to build this solid foundation trendingtrendingtrending

A snapshot of all existing holders on etherscan has been captured prior to this announcement to make sure there is no manipulation. Any purchase on Bitmart if it does not appear on etherscan, you will not receive the airdrop.

When we hit 5,000 HOLDERS holders on etherscan, only existing and new wallets with the valued mentioned below will be eligible to receive the airdrops. Transferred wallets are not eligible.

At 5,000 HOLDERS (the price at the time), below wallets (wallet value) will receive the airdrop

1. USD 500 or more=> airdrop of $100
2. USD 1,000 or more => airdrop of $200

223,2021-12-03,"FREE App that uses artificial intelligence to detect rugpulls and honeypotsHey guys,

Just want to share with you a tool that I am using before I invest on crypto projects.

It is a tool that will help people detect scams, rugpulls and honeypots using artificial intelligence

Use the app. It is free! you don’t need to buy the token! Buying the token will only be required to use advanced features of the app like presale sniper, stop loss/limit orders on DEXES ,etc. that are still under development.

The tool uses AI. It gets smarter everytime it is used. Currently it can only scan bsc tokens but will be able to scan all contracts in the future once the devs are able to bridge to other blockchains

If you find errors, feel free to report. It will help in making the AI smarter.

It is a startup crypto project and it is currently being improved. Your feedback will help in making crypto investing safer for everyone.

226,2024-06-09,"I'm 100% sure, I found the next Shiba inu and it's called Kendu inu (I invite you to verify my research, you'll see that it's true)I stumbled upon this incredible find some time ago, and since then, my confidence in it has only grown. Rumor has it that the Shiba Inu developer is keeping an eye on the project via Twitter. Initially skeptical, I recently confirmed it, and let me tell you, that alone convinced me this project is set to explode.

But don't just take my word for it. Go verify it yourself. Look up shytoshikusama on Twitter; that's the real Shiba Inu developer. Follow them, then check out the official Kendu Inu Twitter at KenduInu. You'll see shytoshikusama does indeed follow it.

Moreover, Miyazaki (kendu founder) has strong ties and is a Shiba Inu OG. Big things are in store for this coin once it hits certain milestones. The Shiba Inu developer even showed up in our Telegram and had a chat with us.

Kendu is featued on shib magazine few days ago, and we've got several top exchanges lined up like Okex, Binance and Kraken.

The projected volume has convinced me that we'll reach Shiba Inu-like levels at market caps of 40-50 billion.

Do yourselves a favor and grab this golden opportunity before you regret it. This coin is poised to skyrocket in the upcoming bull run, making history in investing.

The Kendu Chads community is fantastic, supportive, and welcoming. Their motto, ""We work together, and we don't gamble,"" speaks volumes. Check them out on Reddit and the official Telegram channel.

If you're still on the fence, spend time with the Kendu Chads, and you'll soon realize it's the smart move. If it doesn't resonate with you, then it might not be your thing, and that's okay.

But mark my words, you'll regret missing out when you see it take off. Opportunities like this for easy gains don't come often. Seize it, take action, and you'll reap the rewards.

Consider this a gift—a golden lottery ticket. It's a privilege to know about it at this early stage compared to where it's headed.

Join us; we're a community, and we're revolutionizing safe investing. We're not gambling; we're building our future together as a family of Chads.

What does this community and investment mean to me? It means greater well-being for myself, my family, and friends. It means being able to help more people in the future.

I'm embarking on the next chapter of my life with Kendu, and I invite you all to join me.

Wishing you all deep blessings.

228,2021-10-05,"Five Rules to Help You Not Lose All Your Money In Altcoins**Tl;DR: I've isolated the five principles that I've distilled from expert investors and applied them to** [high-risk, high-reward altcoin investing](https://cryptopragmatist.com/sign-up/)**.**

\-Investing is separated from gambling in large part by the set of fundamental truths investors can always fall back on:

* **Diversification of a portfolio with uncorrelated assets decreases risk.**
* **Exposure to risk increases the probability of reward.**
* **Past performance is no guarantee of future results.**

There is value to having these universal axioms in our back pocket—on red days and green days, pumps or dumps, we can look at them and apply an untainted perspective to our portfolio.

While the above points are true across investing, each different investment has a set of these principles that are only applicable to that specific asset class.

Today, I’d like to address some universal truths that are a bit narrower in scope: the advice, axioms, and principles that are specific and universal to investing in Altcoins.

>**Below are the five that, when employed properly, can allow you to use altcoins to become wealthy.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/g2g67dqlvor71.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=c5f939802a0d5e3c7700b9df2defc0d36a376433

Most people who have the conviction that Bitcoin will go to $500k may make an error when evaluating risk by not seeing all of the risks.Of course crypto investors understand the most apparent risks when buying Bitcoin:

* **Volatility Risk**, the risk that the price of an asset may fluctuate wildly
* **Market Risk**, the risk that all assets face as markets rise and fall (part of this is the risk of Bitcoin going to zero)

But other risks must be understood as well:

* **Opportunity Cost**, the cost of investing in Bitcoin over investing over another asset. Part of this is related to volatility, the likelihood that there might be a lower entry point where you could make more money.
* **Regulatory Risk,** the risk that Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency might be regulated out of existence
* **Operational Risk,** the risk that cryptocurrency might be attacked, hacked or that the internet might go down and you won’t have access to your money
* **Inflation Risk,** the risk that good returns will be nullified relative to a specific currency’s purchasing power

There’s another type of risk that’s rarely touched on, but exists:

* A type of **Liquidity Risk**, the likelihood that you’ll have the conviction to hold onto an investment should it dip or should you have to pay some obligation. Maybe Bitcoin goes to $500k, but you were forced to sell at a loss due to some type of personal liquidation event.

All of this leads to a universal truth: **even if you knew Bitcoin was going to $500k,** you’d still have to consider these other risks. Cloud you withstand a 99% drop? Should you wait for a drop? Do you have obligations to pay? How long will it take to reach your target price?

In a bullish environment where we focus more on price predictions than risk predictions, it’s vitally important to consider these other factors. A good high-risk investor will have an explanation for how to manage every single one of these risks.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/j5or6mq2wor71.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd5dfe4e93200a7c77a8e2d0ff7eeffba812e41d

The necessity of being right is pretty obvious: if an asset is not effective, not adopted, has no use cases, it will go to zero.

Non-consensus right is a different story: US treasuries are considered the least-risky asset available. You could be right in assuming that they’re going to pay regular yields, but the opportunity to make money is limited because it’s assumed that the payout is secure.

So the opportunity to make high returns is when we go against the agreed-upon norms: if we were to short US treasuries, and then the government went bankrupt, we’d stand to gain tons of money.

For cryptocurrency, we must seek these non-consensus opportunities. Look for divides and disagreements in the community, or better yet, universal opinions. Do you believe in a low-market-cap crypto? That presents a great opportunity for high returns.

Do you think that Bitcoin is going to zero? That's another opportunity to go against the consensus (although keep in mind that sometimes the consensus is correct).

Good high-risk investors seek the opportunity to go against the grain.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/j8ms4kx4wor71.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3ff5e51bfb8ef460aa673e9700a7239aa5be89a

Markets can also be inefficient in periods of low volume, ultra-bearish activity, ultra-bullish activity, or in early stages of existence.

If the underlying asset is creating wealth, you’re even better off. While the art market is inefficient, it doesn’t create a lot of new wealth as it’s inaccessible. The accessibility of NFT markets and the fact that it allowed many people to unlock the value of their creations means it’s a tremendous opportunity.

Altcoins are also a good space to apply this philosophy. Low liquidity can be a double-edged sword, benefiting you or making it impossible for you to exit a position. Information efficiencies also apply here.

Take a look at [$SPELL](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/spell-token/markets/) and its collateral-backed stablecoin, [$MIM](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/magic-internet-money/). These trading pairs are thinly traded across DEXes, aren't listed on centralized exchanges, and have different prices on different exchanges. On one hand, that's an issue: it's hard to move the assets around, it's hard to understand the current market price.

On the other hand, it's a powerful way for arbitrageurs to create value by making markets and for speculators to get a good deal.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/c3asu363xor71.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=55ed8eea6d73c61b55ed23b1a988ed300ee854b1

The importance of the *ability* to double down on a successful investment is illustrated in the popularity of Pro Ratas in venture capital, a contract stipulating that an investor who has already invested also has the first right to future investment opportunities in that company.

​Venture capitalists and angels understand that we should bet on winners, not losers. A good asset at a fair price often performs better than a bad asset at a great price. Bubbles should not be wasted.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/17afvr64xor71.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4961b1c7b74231207288ef01a5e34877b48dd9a

Investing is about executing and compounding judgement. Two investors starting with the same amount of capital, with one of them having just 10% better judgment, will have wildly different outcomes over the long term.

I’ve always had a difficult time mentally merging these concepts that tend to be contradictory in practice. Take, for example, the following quotes:

>“Diversification is protection against ignorance. It makes little sense if you know what you are doing.”  
>  
>\- Warren Buffett

And:

>“If you make 100 investments and just one yields a 1000x return, the other 99 investments could go to zero and you would still see a return of 10x for your portfolio.”  
>  
>\-Naval Ravikant

&#x200B;

These two investors are not diametrically opposed by any means, in fact, I’d argue that they’re much more similar than different: longtime investors, each with many compounding, mid-sized successes.

These two opposing ideas can be unified by something called the Kelly Criterion.

If you were to place an even money bet (a bet of $1 pays out $1) on a coin that landed on heads 60% of the time, with 100 opportunities, and you were given $100, how much would you bet each time?

Well, the odds are in your favor—so perhaps you should bet the entire amount?

No. If you lose that first bet, you’re left with nothing, and thus your advantage is completely nullified. You must bet a small fraction (there’s a mathematical answer to the equation that I won't get into) to maximize your earnings.

How does this apply to crypto? Well, a nearly-sure bet on a high-reward outcome isn’t, by any means, a sure thing. Capital preservation with high-risk investments is the name of the game. Diversify between high-risk bets. Understand that with a lower risk or larger reward, the larger your optimal bet becomes.

&#x200B;

**A Successful Cryptocurrency Investor**

To be successful, a cryptocurrency investor must create a system in which they can be disciplined, math-driven, reflective, calm. The higher the risk, the lower the margin for error.The principles will remain the same, the investors, assets, returns, and market conditions will always change. But crypto markets are far from efficient, and periods of outstanding returns are far from over.

Follow your own rules, understand your own risk tolerance. Do it right and there’s plenty of money (2x, 5x, 10x, and even 100x) to be made in high-potential altcoins.

The second (original) meme coin ever created is being wrapped as we speak and will be ready for launch in approximately three weeks time on the Binance smart chain. Banano turned three years old one month ago and things have gone bananas ever since.

To celebrate this Banano has put together a contest for whoever can do the best wrapping.

Friendly reminder of the two most important equations in the world; BAN = potassium19 / E = mc2

236,2023-01-25,"Bulls or bears? Is this really important in the long term? 

As an investor, it can be challenging to navigate the ever-changing crypto market. One of the most debated topics is whether the market is currently in a bull or bear phase. However, it’s important to note that it’s not as crucial to focus on this as opposed to following current trends, allowing you to make investment decisions accordingly.

One strategy that I personally employ is to focus on mid-cap projects that have been active during the bear market and contain potential for growth in specific sectors. For example, some of my best investments have been in projects such as OCEAN, UTK, and QRDO (not financial advice).

OCEAN is a project that I believe has great potential in the AI (Artificial Intelligence) sector, as even many ""big"" influencers are bullish in this space. My own rule is to avoid investing in projects that stagnate during the bear market, and OCEAN has definitely been building a lot in the past year. I’m confident that it will go much higher in the bull run.  
[https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ocean-protocol](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ocean-protocol)

UTK is another project that I believe has great potential. They’ve been changing their tokenomics and adding more utility to the token while also adding some fantastic partnerships, such as Lugano's use of Utrust infrastructure for crypto payments. Even though there isn't much hype about the crypto payment sector, it has been gradually growing for several years now.  
[https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/utrust](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/utrust)

Lastly, QRDO is a project that I believe has tremendous potential for institutional investors in crypto. They offer different solutions for managing assets and have been busy in the past year. I expect to see many big partnerships in the future.

238,2021-09-16,"Why you should hold Smartlandshttps://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/smartlands

In this short article, I will explain how the mechanics of SLT are unique in terms of passive income compared to other tokens based on inflation. Especially in regards to how buying at a low token price is your chance to lock a future APR rate.

​

Token ABC:

I will start by making a parallel with most of the other Token's staking mechanics, which gives a fixed return in terms of a Token %. For example, a 10% APR inflation staking reward means that in a year, for every Token you stake, you will receive 0.1 Token.

Most tokens that you can stake usually work this way, where the supply of that token is inflated and redistributed to stakers.

Let's take for example an imaginary 100$ Token called ABC, which brings 10% APY when it is staked.

Staking a 100$ ABC bringing 10% APR would give you 10 bucks a year.

Once that ABC falls to 10$, you are now receiving 1 buck a year, and if it jumps to 1000$ you now receive 100$/year.

But, in the end, you always receive 10% APR, whether you buy the token at 100$, or once it hits 1000$.

​

Token SLT:

As for SLT, Bear or Bull, you get the same return or higher as more assets get listed.

SLT rewards are in no way influenced by the current crypto sentiment, the rewards are backed by how many Real Assets are getting listed and traded on Smartland's platform.

Staking rewards are coming from 33.33% of Smartlands fees, that's it. A direct bite of Revenues, not Profits...

Now, let's assume a 10$ SLT (currently it is sitting at 8$). Let's say in the 1st year of Operation Smartlands tokenizes around 1 Billion $ of assets (Smartlands near-term goal), this would approximately mean that for every SLT you hold, you receive 7$.

If you bought your SLT at 10$ you are getting a 70% APR.

Now imagine you onboard your friend after that year and he buys some SLT at 100$.

If we assume no extra growth and they also tokenized 1 Billion $ on that second year and distributes 7$ / SLT, your friend is getting 7% APR on his purchase.

​

Conclusion:

Remove yourself from the Token resell value and only think about passive income, anyway, that's the whole point of holding SLT.

The earlier you are, the lower your purchase cost of SLT is, then the better APR you are setting yourself for in the future.

Now as SLT grows, imagine when/if they can tokenize over 1 Billion / year. Every 10$ SLT you purchase sets you up for a crazy return on investment for the future.

Think about passive income, not resell value. You have that chance right now, take it.

Joke, not a financial advisor.

TL/DR: The return is not relative to the invested amount, but the number of tokens.",positive,0.9177358,54

240,2021-04-28,"MelloToken Update: April 28th, 2021**Top 25 on CoinmarketCap 24hr gainers list, New updates regarding Casino Development coming soon**

Today, April 28th, Mello saw continued accelerated growth! Holders have been steadily increasing and the team has not taken their foot off the pedal. Mello Token also happened to find itself among the top 25 gainers on CoinMarketCap today! It is inspiring to see Mello appear so high on that list in such a relatively short period of time-- certainly it is surreal for all of the people that have been pouring their hearts into this project for weeks!

Mello is excited to pump out a few announcements **over the course of the next week** that are sure to be exciting for both long time holders and newcomers alike. 

Stay tuned!!!

**What is Mello?**

The Mello Token is a redistributive cryptocurrency built on Binance Smart Chain (BSC). The fast and inexpensive transactions of BSC make the Mello Token perfect for integration into our Virtual Reality Casino concept. A 3% redistribution fee is placed on all transfers, purchases, and sales of Mello (outside of exchanges) which is rewarded to all holders. Put simply, all holders of Mello earn rewards on a constant basis which will be eligible for play inside the Mello casino.

**Why Mello?**The Mello team has been equal parts meticulous and aggressive in the development process of their project thus far. The team has already shown their faces and are obviously committed... they have been checking off items from their roadmap one by one. As of late, the Mello team has been finalizing some very exciting developments with regard to the casino.

Entering the enormous casino market with high transaction volume, the 3% redistribution has the potential to prove wildly beneficial for holders of Mello.Launched a month ago and with a market cap of roughly $12 million, Mello Token has tons of room to grow.

The first iteration Mello web Casino will launch by the end of Q3 / beginning of Q4, after which the team will be focusing their efforts on Virtual Reality development and partnerships. Mello is currently in the process of forming further partnerships which will help facilitate the development of other aspects of the Mello vision.

**GammaStack Partnership**

Mello recently announced a partnership with GammaStack.GammaStack began operations a decade ago as a bespoke software development company, and today stands tall as an established IT solutions provider that has helped guide more than 500 clients across the world in building successful tech projects.

Gammastack offers tailored services which help organizations to accelerate the integration of the latest technology trends including AR and Blockchain integrations.

**\~4,400 Holders as of April 28th, 2021**Mello has been gaining approx. 100 holders per day on average since launch! This is indicative of extremely healthy, regular, organic growth.

**The first Mello video AMA went live on April 23rd, 2021**

The Mello team went live on twitch and discord for their first face to face AMA.. it's always nice when the team shows their faces and answers questions! Check out the recording on YouTube here:[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t4ijATtuz8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t4ijATtuz8)

246,2022-01-29,"JACY - Shitcoin to AltCoin a Journey - My thesis on a burgeoning community and what focused dev teams are capable of!A little bit of background: Jacy (formerly Jacywaya) is a token that originated towards the end of the last rush cycle. Jacywaya originally was developed with all the aspirations of a ""Meme Token."" It had a cute fuzzy Inu mascot; the original contract was renounced, hype marketing was in full swing. Then the house of cards began to fall, the former developers started to withdraw and ultimately abandoned our sweet little Waya pup. The chart slid down, and hope was lost for the community at large, almost...

  
A small group came together and reached out to one of the former developers. They arranged to transfer the Waya contract, keys, and wallets. This team worked to secure the remaining liquidity and marketing/development funds. They socialized out these facts to a dwindling community on the original subreddit. People began to hope there was a chance that their investment was not lost. The new team, along with the support of the community, began to rebuild the token's social presence, rekindling the Telegram and creating a Discord group. Twitter, FB, IG, and Reddit began to reform as a unified brand. Interest in this comeback story began to spread; people came to support the underdog. Slowly, the chart reflected this positive change for a token rising like the phoenix.

  
The holiday season proved very exciting for the community as a whole, the token reached new all-time highs, and no investor from the former project team was in the red. Everyone was excited to see where we could all go from here. The new team continued to engage the community, released a new website, and began developing a new project vision and white paper to share with the community. They were also working behind the scenes carving out a new smart contract, a new beginning to the Jacy story. 

  
Migration day came, and as with all token migrations, not without its share of concerns and confusion. Not to mention inherent troubles when coordinating with 3rd parties such as Coin Market Cap, Coin Gecko, Coinbase, etc. Overall, the team executed a near-flawless deployment and migration of all wallet assets to this new flexible contract. January 8th, 2022, marked the proper start of the new Jacy project; we had left the Waya suffix and its Meme connotations behind. Once the team had completed the migration, the new white paper was released. A well-defined project scope, thorough tokenomics details, supporting history, and vision detailed. Now the community and potential investors could see what the team saw. A new sense of this project became clear, a long-term goal to become an impactful project to change how users could interact with Defi and NFTs. A solid project definition creates a bridge that clearly shows a project's intentions. Coupled with a team with the wisdom and experience across all the relevant subject domains to support and drive the mission, you have a recipe for success.

  
Vision and execution are core to successfully developing a project; community is as important if not more so. The community that supports a project helps to guide and nurture. As the community grows, so does its voice. People talk about the projects that excite them; they bring in friends and family when confident in their investments. As the community grows, so does the project through investment in marketing and development. 

  
Jacy has engaged with professional marketing and begun to execute the development roadmap. As we all wait for this market overall to settle, I encourage you to take the time to review the [website](https://jacytoken.io), read the [white paper](https://jacytoken.io/Jacy-Token-WP.pdf), and join the [socials](https://linktr.ee/jacytoken). Once the market overall begins to surge, I have faith that Jacy will rise as well. I implore you to do the research and decide for yourself if Jacy may be suitable for your investment goals.

  
To make a move from the proverbial shitcoin to altcoin is a journey. It is similar to the marketing of a new product. You have your early adopters, then a gap where a company or team must be committed and strong to weather the storm. Once you cross the gap and more investors begin to see the utility and overall strength, a project starts to mature and grow in value. Jacy token has weathered ups and downs both within the scope of the token and with the market overall. The current community base is proving to be solid and unwavering in commitment. We as a community have seen holders come and go, rebounding and growing further strength and size in our holder base through each gyration. I implore this community to research this project and make your own decision on whether you feel that Jacy may one day become an Altcoin and cross the proverbial gap.

Hello guys at r/altcoin ... The last TikiTalk AMA #5 hyped me so much, that I have to share the news with you...

 Conversations with big - that means very well known - centralized exchanges (CEX)!

Details About TIKI Token:

$TIKI is the first of its kind, a unique automated BNB reflection token, enabling holders to benefit greatly from hourly automated reflection straight into their wallet, how convenient cool Holders can also easily view and keep track of their reflections through an eye catchy Tiki Dashboard.

248,2021-06-18,"The Collective Coin [$250 K Market Cap] [5 Days Old] Listed on CoinGecko. 700 holders. Preview of the front end design of the marketplace now available on website! The Collective is developing BSC's first decentralized freelancer marketplace. Imagine a crypto fiverr! Preview of design for the front end of the Marketplace is now available at https://www.thecollectivecoin.co 

The Collective is the future home of one of the first crypto decentralized freelance marketplaces bringing together artists, developers, marketers, and other providers of various products and services, while providing their prospective clients a safe and secure means to do business.

The Collective Coin is a community driven Defi coin and will be the official currency of The Collective. The coin will be the main currency on the marketplace.

Main features:

COMMUNITY-DRIVEN

We strive to maintain a strong community that supports and represents what The Collective stands for. At launch, there will be five separate developer wallets that will each hold 1%, for a total of 5% of the total supply. These wallets will help fund the development of the Collective Marketplace. The developers of The Collective will then participate with the public in purchasing of additional coins.

trendingBURN SYSTEM

After every trade occurs 5% of the transaction will be burned forever into a burn wallet that is locked away. This will decrease the total supply and increase the value of the coin.

AUTOMATIC LIQUiDITY POOL

After every trade occurs 5% contributes towards automatically generating liquidity that goes into multiple pools used by exchanges.

THE MARKETPLACE

Currently offering graphic design services in exchange for cryptocurrencies, the goal of The Collective is to create a decentralized marketplace, inspired by platforms such as Etsy and Fiverr, for other providers to also offer their products and services to clients in exchange for The Collective Coin, or virtually any established cryptocurrency of their choosing, for a small fee.

Providers will create a profile, and have the ability to establish a virtual storefront on the Marketplace, which will be accessible through a dApp from the user’s wallet.

Tokenomics:

Total Supply: 500,000,000,000,000 (500 Trillion) Supply after 50% Burn: 250,000,000,000,000 (250 Trillion) Private Community ICO: 8.4% (21.5 Trillion) 375B/BNB - 73 Wallets Dev Wallets: 5% (12.5 Trillion) 2.5 Trillion/per wallet - 5 Wallets Unicrypt Presale: 27% (135 Trillion) 300B/BNB Liquidity Locked One Year, locked for 3 more years: 79 Trillion

250,2021-05-03,"$WINDY WindSwap - HUGE UPDATES - The First Deflationary DeFi Bridging Token**MEGA Windswap Update**

Hello again! Last time we spoke we had some minor changes, this week we got huge updates everywhere, take a look below:

**trending** Advanced Charting **trending**

**trending** Staking is now available **trending**

**trending** New Website has been launched **trending**

**trending** New Telegram bot **trending**

There is probably more which I have forgotten already since there is so much new stuff every week! How is that chart looking you may ask? **VERY BULLISH.** We reached 5K holders and the market cap is still **8M only.**

**What is Windswap ($WINDY)?**

$WINDY takes full advantage of BSC cross-chain features in order to power trading between multiple currencies. The token will be used in functionalities that are soon coming to their live DEX platform which has been released a few days ago.

https://app.windswap.finance/

**Deflation?**

*Yes, but not forever.*

WindSwap charges a small levy for every transaction. For every 2.5 Million volume traded there will be a rebase. This rebase will burn 75% of the tokens that were taxed, and the remaining 25% of the tokens will go to the holders. There will be a total of 192 of these cycles which will cause the supply to drop to 8.8 Million tokens. Every day $WINDY gets more exposure and therefore more trading volume, which means every next cycle will be completed faster than the previous one.

**Why should I invest?**

I did some research about DEX tokens, and you can basically divide them into two categories. Those who do deliver, and those who don't. So far the WindSwap team has delivered on every promise they made. Therefore I believe that the market cap is absurdly undervalued: Literally 10M for a working DEX market cap. To sum it up:

* Low Market Cap - Currently just $10M
* Rug Proof - 80% of Tokens are being used for liquidity on Pancake Swap (99% Liquidity Locked on Unicrypt)
* High Organic Growth
* Holders are rapidly growing
* Coin supply halved by MAY.
* A functional product with very promising things to come.

**Why is this platform different from all the others?**

The Windswap team has shown us some things they wanted to implement, they are very active in the telegram group. Here is a list of things they are working on as we speak:

* Slippage slider (**Already in**)
* Cross-chain swapping
* UI Improvements
* Charting tools (**Already in**)
* Automatic Slippage 
* Limit Orders
* Due Diligence / Rug Checker

**Conclusion:**

A new competitor on the DEX market with very promising features, with a token that rewards early adopters through the aggressive early on cycled burn pattern. By the time the burn cycles are completed more than half of the features should be implemented (May). They are not aiming for a quick buck, they are aiming for a good product that will be active in the market for years to come.

251,2022-08-04,"Energy Use From US Crypto Mining Firms is Contributing to Rising Utility Bills. If You Are A Miner, What Are Your Alternatives?Energy use from US crypto mining firms is contributing to rising utility bills. An investigation revealed that companies use enough energy to power Houston, and contribute to growing carbon emissions. In a nutshell, they are burning more energy and resources to generate less profit now.

However, there are many green cryptos right now. If you are a miner, and care about the energy consumption, cost, and the bad effect on the environment, you can try other mineable cryptos that consume less power, greener, or even more profitable. For example Crypton, the native coin of Utopia P2P.

Utopia P2P is the Internet without damage to nature. Utopia P2P is a decentralized multifunctional ecosystem with a low carbon footprint. It unites conscious people and enables them to make the most of the green Internet for free.

You only need internet and a PC or VPS to start Crypton's ""easy-mining"" process. I've posted the link below if you want to know how to mine this altcoin.

Today there is another great news about the Arigato gaming project. Arigato has been listed on Coinmarketcap today!

[https://coinmarketcap.com/de/currencies/arigato/](https://coinmarketcap.com/de/currencies/arigato/)

For those who don't know about Arigato's project yet... Arigato is working on an API for game developers to simplify the integration of Crypto (Arigato Token) into gaming. This API allows earning Crypto in different games and in different ways (game developers have room to integrate Crypto into their game in different ways thanks to the API).

Everyone can imagine how such a project will revolutionize the gaming industry. Therefore, be one of the early investors of Arigato before it is too late - Especially now that Arigato has been listed on coinmarketcap (and soon on coingecko), the project will grow very fast!

Arigato´s Website:

255,2021-04-29,"DD on SeaScape.Network: strong potential to gain x30 over the next 8 weeks?On February 3rd 2021, I predicted that Audius, at $0.226 with a market cap of $27m would x20, 8 weeks later, Audius hit an ATH of $4.99 with a market cap of $580m. That post is given below and everything is documented and verifiable in time.

My next prediction is Seascape, and the market cap is just $28m rn, very similar to Audius, however, in contrast to Audius, the networking effects are arguably 'stickier' and more significant within the game developer space than in the music artist space which Audius targeted. Seascape currently has a 24h trading Volume (ticker: CWS/USDT) of just $105k on [MXC.com](https://mxc.com/) and $168K on [gate.io](https://gate.io/) and $1.7m total trading volume across all platforms (coingecko numbers).

The same deep learning bot used to identify Audius identified Seascape as a prime candidate set to experience organic exceptionally outsized gains over the coming months.

**Current Technical and Price Action Analysis**

Recent price action showed an accumulation phase occurred over 5 days within a symmetric triangle formation above the $15 support zone (which held strong with heavy buyer activity seen), leading to a 50% upside breakout move, extending price action above the previous support of $24. Price action now remains steady within the $25-$30 region and it looks like another symmetric triangle accumulation will be forming before a 2nd upside breakout soon, especially if holders buy in following this post. A vigorous Elliot Wave impulse completing a fibonacci retracement to $50 is now strongly predicted, with an expectation of turning the $50 resistance level into a new support for growth towards $100. Price action has crossed and is being watched to stay above the 50 day MA.

**Fundamental Analysis**

**Investors:** Binance, LD Capital, Paka, Spark Digital Capital, Nabais Capital, M6, DU Capital, JRR Capital.

**Partners:** Chainlink, Moonbeam, Opensea, Maker, Binance Smart Chain, Matic and Treasureland.

Seascape seeks to become the STEAM game distribution platform for DeFi and this is a much more realistic proposition than becoming a massive AAA-game developer such as the Activision of DeFi, indeed, we are years away from seeing anything like that. Like Audius, this is a coin with a website that the GENERAL PUBLIC CAN UNDERSTAND with a product that can be used now, granted they only have a few games, they are developing their blockchain to make it very cost effective and scalable for much bigger game titles to use them as their **in-game coin economy** partner, making Seascape a great choice even if a game developer has much better distribution than Seascape now (which would only help Seascape further market itself).

Fundamentally, Seascape is an **in-game economy technology partner first and foremost. They are doing the hard stuff, unlike Ultra, so that they later this year become THE distribution partner of choice for DeFi game titles.** Ultra is basically Steam with tokens with a few big name game developers using them as first movers focused on marketing and player incentives, and hit an ATH of around $250m market cap. Seascape can do what Ultra does in a **much** more powerful way using their current technology AND Seascape intends to build out much more intensive player incentivisation than those Ultra has on offer now, so in terms of market cap, Seascape has the fundamentals to exceed Ultra by a factor of at least x3. Seascape has the fundamentals to exceed Ultra by a factor of at least x3. Price target is $750 is 8-12 weeks.

I also have contacts at Supercell (who made the great Clash of Clans) and I will hook these guys up. I spent the last few days talking to the founder of Seascape and drilled him for information and believe they are on the right track for stellar growth. Moreover, Seascape's IDO platform for launching new games will be released soon so CWS holders will automatically become investors in an entire defi games industry that will be built on top of the Seascape network, much of the token release schedule is focused on growing that so the inflation effects of new token release should be more than mitigated by their use in supporting this new gaming industry sector which could be worth billions.

[CWS = Prime HODL Token](https://preview.redd.it/90qb78e3z7w61.jpg?width=1112&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b46a82295b547dbd6ae1e0b4d5c267ec505cdf38)

**Seascape and NFTs:** 25,000 Seascape gaming NFTs have been minted on the BSC and millions of dollars dropped to users through their LP mining game. Increase in its NFT economy alone could add an extra $50m-$100m to its mcap over the next couple months.

**Remember**: this is a Reddit post, it is NOT financial advice, dispense your loads where ever you wish after doing your own DD and research and maybe throwing a dart at a wall. YOLO. I'm in for around 2,000 CWS held right now.

**Notes:**

pCWS is the bridged version of CWS (the currency of Seascape on ETH) on BSC (Binance Smart Chain). Users can bridge from ETH to BSC using poly.network bridge. 1 CWS = 1 pCWS as they are completely interchangeable. Here's a walk-through of Polybridge: [https://medium.com/seascape-network/bridge-your-crowns-to-bsc-today-through-poly-network-eaabde846d1](https://medium.com/seascape-network/bridge-your-crowns-to-bsc-today-through-poly-network-eaabde846d1)

**High number of coins in a few wallets:**

Audius had a similar position where 84% of coins were held in 2 wallets. Seascape's token release schedule is structured to cause growth in their ecosystem and corresponding growth in their price to mitigate future inflation effects. Essentially new games will be backed by newly released CWS acting as collateral for newly minted game coin economies generated on the Seascape blockchain. This means, as a new game grows its user base and its in game economy grows in value, those additionally released CWS should in effect pay for themselves mitigating inflation effects. Interestingly, Audius had a similar reason for releasing new coins, i.e. to attract new artists, and it grew from $27m mcap to an ath of $580m.

**KEY FEATURES:**

* Any game released on the Seascape Platform will have the option to create their own blockchain with its own set of rules. 
* Decentralized cross-chain bonding curve market to allow seamless price discovery of digital assets for users and projects
* User-facing game store built with DeFi in mind. Any user can serve as a PoS validator. Monthly gamepasses for users, no fees for game devs.
* Implement gamified aspects of DeFi and traditional finance into games as part of core gameplay. In-game staking, CDP's and more!

Yes, Hege Dev is an animator but that does not means he doesn't know what to do and how to make a great project.

259,2021-11-06,"CargoX - Why I think this is a hidden gem. (Cooperation with the Egyptian government, New projects around the corner - financial sector, demand is generated by business)**The main idea of the project?** 

CargoX - [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/cargox/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/cargox/)

The basic idea is to modernize the logistics sector, especially container transport, which is carried out by ship, truck, etc. Each delivery must have the same characteristics as the other. A Bill of Lading (B/L) that documents what the contents of the container are, the owner and where it is travelling to. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill\_of\_lading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_of_lading)) And that's just a nice usecase to use blockchain in something that still uses paper and a stamp (BL), which usually travels outside the normal path of the container using courier services that increase the cost of shipping.

Today's project expansion - finance and letter of credits

From 20 October 2021. China Systems, the global provider of trade and supply chain finance solutions, has partnered with CargoX to seamlessly integrate the blockchain processing of electronic Bills of Lading and other trade documents into their Trade and SCF platform. The integrated solution bridges physical and financial supply chain processes based on a digital handshake between buyer and supplier, triggering receivables financing.

[https://www.chinasystems.com/press/cargox-partners-with-china-systems-to-enable-digital-instant-liquidity-model-for-global-trade](https://www.chinasystems.com/press/cargox-partners-with-china-systems-to-enable-digital-instant-liquidity-model-for-global-trade)

**What is the main benefit?**

· The value will be determined by market demand, but mainly driven by B2B trade. Thus, a new FIAT from companies is flowing into the cryptocurrency circulation.

· The team is actively communicating with the community and understands that it is only through ICO backers that they have been able to build a functioning multinational company with an overlap of the original intention, which was to build an eBL.

**Main differences from other tokens:**

· In terms of market capitalization, it is the smallest project that works with governments on digitization. Specifically, on October 1, a project was launched in Egypt for eBL.

· The team is working regardless of the Bearish/Bull market - constant, hard work. Numerous conferences, awards and certifications are proof.

· Team members understand the value of CXO tokens.

**Why is the price currently stagnating?**

Since CargoX operates in the real business, the expectations of crypto-speculators and the real state of affairs often do not meet. Let's recap:

· September 1 - A significant drop occurred when the tokenomics changed. Instead of burning from the team wallet - there was the introduction of buybacks from the market. Although the resulting impact on price is direct and setting a fixed price of 60 cents per document is preferable to the original system, it was not immediately well received. Although there were legislative reasons for this change.

· 1st October - Launch of ACI - Nafeza Egypt. We were expected to have 5-6 thousand documents per day. The best estimates were around 10 thousand. Unfortunately, on October 1 (Friday) there was a continuous increase and there were 1384. Disappointing = price drop. Never mind that the ship sails for 6 weeks and the introduction applies to those ships that sail and arrive after Oct 1 = the peak should have been about mid-November. And indeed. Today we also have 11000 thousand documents a day. However, no reaction to the price.

· Why no response. Simple. The team promised to do buybacks quarterly and yet none has occurred. Never mind that it has been confirmed several times by the team that nothing is changing and indeed, it applies to all types of documents. They are even working on another token utilization - relayer, which will perform authentication. Later this year.

**What can we expect?**

Currently, over 188,000 documents have been confirmed in the month of operation (including September - when the pilot was running). Which means the buyback from the market is $113k. At the current price of 20 cents, we have a buyback of 565,000 CXOs. That means that the buyback alone will, at least temporarily, mean a 50% increase in price. However, if the first buyback is made, we can expect the current hodlers (approx. 4k) to have their doubts dispelled and in turn buy back their previous positions. This means that we can expect a FOMO rise and I would be surprised if we close 2021 below the price of $1. However, we will discuss the exact calculation in the next article.

I've Recently come across this great coin.
They have a prominent use case in my opinion and they show a lot of promise in crypto and even the investing world!

I did join their Telegram and notice alot of involvement with the team that set it up, which is fully DOXXED btw.

The thing i like most is that they have a real use case.
The CEO posted alot and we had some small AMAs already and he wants to invest in real life assets when the App they are making is done.

They are listed onCoinGecko and i believe that the request for listing on CMC is on its way now because the holders are reaching the 2500 mark needed!

https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/decentralized-community-investment-protocol

They also have a big AMA planned this Sunday the 22nd, Its being held in a real safe or so we have been told in the community.
I look forward to it and maybe opening up a few discussions :D .

I wanted to ask what everyone thinks about this?
I believe a real use case as this one could be awesome and i will invest (and have already invested) in this Coin!

Not sure if its allowed but i do wan tto add the TG link in here. they have several servers, i am personally in the ""original"" one and the Dutch group which is new but also showing that everyone is helping eachother.

Milk and Butter tokens, for those that haven’t heard, are companion tokens in the Binance Smart Chain with an emphasis on charity giving. Milk is an RFI token that can be staked to generate Butter, which is used to power community voting for their favorite charities on a weekly basis. Those that merely wish to vote may purchase Butter tokens on the open market as well, which also drives rewards for those that stake Milk! 
https://www.milktoken.net/voting.html

5% of all Butter transactions are guaranteed to go to a charity wallet. In addition, Butter can be used to suggest new charities.
https://www.milktoken.net/suggest.html

$25,000 has been donated to charity so far, at a market cap of only 800K. We made crypto history when Butter became the first BEP-20 token to partner with a major food charity: Food For Life Global  https://ffl.org/20077/cryptocurrency-butter-token/

The liquidity for both the Milk and Butter tokens is locked away until 2022, at which point both will be relocked. Our Market cap is still low with a solid base, we're building our community for healthy growth, and we’ll continue to develop this project with many exciting use cases plus a full array of features to be rolled out as development completes.

Each week the Milk and Butter token team hosts AMAs with the Developer on Twitch where the community can ask any questions they may have. Occasionally, we have guests, last week the CEO of “Food For Life Global” joined us and explained the amazing genesis of “Food for Life Global” and took viewer questions. Our AMA’s stream every Sunday at 3am UTC [here.](https://www.twitch.tv/milkbuttertoken)

Roadmap: 
• Next week gamification of Butter begins with lotto/bingo games being implemented.

• The voting and staking processes will continue to be refined to make the experience as easy and accessible as possible.

• Planned instructional content to help those new to crypto learn about the space and how to purchase and use the Milk and Butter tokens.

• Additional exchange listings


Accomplishments so far: 
• Code built from the ground up to develop both tokens.

• Unique staking and voting systems implemented.
$25,000 donated to various charities in the first month.

• Official global charity partnership with “Food For Life Global” being the first of many.

268,2021-05-14,"Opacity Storage (OPCT): A Comprehensive OverviewGood day Altcoiners! This post will be a comprehensive overview of a small market cap project called **Opacity Storage (OPCT)**.

And yes, I have a bag. It’s one of my biggest holdings next to TEL, ONE, ADA, SIA and ETH. The reason why I post this is because I think small caps also deserve a place in r/altcoin. Especially when it's a project with a real use case and is already functional. Next to all the DeFi, NFT and Meme hype I think utility tokens also deserve some love.

So why Opacity? I'll try to be transparent so I’ll give you the pros and the cons of the project.

CoinMarketCap: [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/opacity/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/opacity/)

CoinGecko: [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/opacity](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/opacity)

# What is Opacity?

Opacity is a private and protected cloud storage solution and OPCT is their utility token. With Opacity, payments, accounts, and files are 100% private. At the moment OPCT is only used to pay for storage plans. 1 OPCT is currently pegged to 64GB of data storage but the peg will go when their network will be decentralized. When decentralization will become a thing the token will also be used for staking, competition between nodes and (d)apps.

Nowadays data breaches are very common but with Opacity you don't have to worry about that at all. Opacity doesn't require any personal information so you can sign-up for a plan anonymously. They store no information on its users, so their cloud is a perfect place to store private information.

Their way of doing encryption is also interesting. When you want to upload a file via Opacity, the data is split into parts (chunks) and encrypted locally in the browser. This isolation ensures that a malicious actor cannot retrieve the user’s data, as it can only be accessed with the corresponding encryption key: the ​Opacity Handle​.

So without this key no one can access your files. Even if it’s centralized and a hacker gets access to your data, he won’t be able to access it because there’s no way he can decrypt it. Can you imagine how secure and anonymous it will be when they offer decentralized storage? This would be the perfect tool for people living in heavily censored countries like China. Heck, I can name a bunch of industries that will truly benefit from this service for sharing their intellectual property, legal documents and company secrets. I’m calling it, this will be the next Mega.nz!

# What can you expect in the coming months?

So yeah, there you have it. A crypto project with a truly working product and not just hype and words. Their CEO hired a complete new team at the start of this year and they’re now with 14 employees. They held an video AMA some months ago and they do video updates weekly. For such a low mcap this project has a lot to offer. It has potential to compete against other competitors like Sia and Filecoin. Check out the infographic where you can quickly read the benefits of Opacity and compare them with their competitors. Take a good look at the difference in market cap!

# What did they deliver so far in 2021:

* ‘Galaxy’ Whitepaper 2.0 for Decentralization
* Open Beta program for Opacity 2.0
* A lot of AMA’s with their CEO
* Weekly video updates
* Community favorite and call of the month of the CryptoStarship signals group
* Added USDT pair on KuCoin this week
* They recently hired more employees to focus on marketing

# Upcoming:

* Next week: Opacity 2.0, it’s their new and improved file storage system! Think of faster upload/downloads, new webUI, new metadata system, better sharing, updated API for everyone to use, etc...
* Easier ways to pay for their services (BSC or Matic bridge, credit card payments with Indacoin)
* More AMA’s, marketing efforts
* Mobile app for Android and iOS (in Q3)
* Decentralization (first tests in Q3)
* API documentation so more people can build their Apps on their platform
* KuCoin promotions (e.g. trading competition to increase volume)

Now let’s talk about the pros and cons about Opacity. Like I said earlier, I want to be transparent and honest about my findings and not just shill. So here goes:

# Pros:

* Cheap. As of the day of writing 1 OPCT is 22 cents. You can buy a 2 TB storage plan FOR A YEAR on their site for 32 OPCT. That’s $7,04 + ETH gas fees (\~ 10 dollar). Unfortunately the Ether Gas fees are high but it still makes it one of the cheapest storage solutions. For example: a 2 TB Google Drive storage plan costs you $120 per year.
* New team with a lot of experience, check [this Medium post](https://medium.com/opacity-storage/the-journey-to-opacity-2-0-starts-now-ac14bc692d5d) to get some more info about the new team. Talking about experience: their CEO, Jason Coppola worked for *Microsoft*, *Paypal*, and *Salesforce*. He knows how to run the place!
* Low mcap, lots of room to grow. Currently rank #866 on CMC.
* No sign-ups required, truly anonymous. You don’t have to worry that your personal information gets leaked.
* Easy to use, the release of the new mobile app and website will have an easy and improved user interface. Think of Google Drive, but anonymous, protected and decentralized.
* Strongly focused on privacy, uses high encryption. Encryption happens on your computer only, even the metadata of the file is getting encrypted.
* A great community with a lot of developers. Check the [community page](https://www.opacity.io/community-page) to see what’s being built on Opacity so far. This list is only getting bigger when this project grows and API documentation will be released.

# Cons:

* Even if the decentralized network will be deployed later this year, it currently is still centralized on AWS S3. End-to-end encryption on the metadata and files is Opacity’s greatest feature, so that’s not necessarily a bad thing. It’s just that decentralization would make it so much better of course.
* High Ethereum gas fees. If you want to buy an Opacity storage plan you pay an insane high amount of gas fees. Although it’s not Opacity’s fault that these fees are so high, they are planning to use a bridge like BSC or Matic to solve this problem.
* Missed deadlines. Originally Opacity 2.0 would be released in April but it got delayed by a month. Delays are a common thing in development, so it’s not such a huge deal breaker. But I thought it’s worth mentioning it at least.
* The project has a dark past, even if it wasn’t their fault: they are a fork of Oyster (PRL). In late 2018 the founder of the project exit scammed by minting tokens and selling them on the market. Leaving all investors, including the team that worked for him empty-handed. Fortunately, he’s in jail now thanks to a 2-year investigation by the FBI and the help of the Opacity team.

Hi for those that don’t know, Butter Token is the first BEP-20 token to partner with a major Food charity and it has donated so much in just one week ($17,000) with a low market cap! For reference, if it had a $100 million market cap $4 million would have gone to charity already. Butter really has the potential to end world hunger!

Not only can people invest like with any other token, but there’s so much more to Milk and Butter Tokens that makes them stand out. The number one thing being that the process is trust-less and automatic. 5% of all transactions are GUARANTEED to go to charity. You can then help choose which charities are available to vote on (partnered charities will always be an option), and then vote on which of the decided charity options get the accrued donation for that week!

Helping yourself by investing, also helps those in need! Milk https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/milk-token/ and Butter have the potential to revolutionize the crypto market having already made crypto history thanks to its Partnership with [“Food For Life Global”](https://ffl.org/about-us/our-partners-sponsors/)”, (a charity promoted by Paul McCartney).

This will bring awareness to those that have never dabbled in crypto, but still want to help out charity while investing in themselves. The [website ](https://www.milktoken.net) will continue to be refined so that the guides and interface are able to introduce anyone to the workings of cryptocurrency.

Butter Token partner “Food For Life Global plans to help with marketing starting today with a newsletter and mailing list update with information on Butter token!

272,2024-07-09,"This project is promising. Big CEX listings and HUGE Marketing push this week!In the meme coin space, a project has to tick multiple boxes in order to have a chance of succeeding in the long term.

We're not talking about **5,000% overnight gains** that translate to a **99.99% loss the next day.** We're talking about projects that grow the best way— **the slow and organic way.**

**Multiple factors determine the quality of a meme coin:** Name (+ticker), Theme of the coin, Content, Leading team (developer + team), and the most vital component— community. **And $HEGE has it all!**

**Name—** I mean, how can you not love the name ""Hege""? Short, simple, and insanely catchy. **You'll remember it, whether willingly or not!**

**Theme of the coin—** Determines how easy it is to market the coin and make memes for it; and low-hanging Hege the hedgehog is one heck of a theme! Slap Hege on anything, and you basically have a funny, attention-grabbing meme. The ideas are limitless.

**Content—** I strongly believe that Hege has reached a level where its content is better than its most similar project content-wise - Ponke's. Animations (especially Chapter 4) and memes are only getting better and more professional. **Maybe we will make an animated movie at a certain Market cap!**

**Leading team—** May the results and their work speak for themselves; **They know how to manage.** Constant giveaways, constant competitions where the most active and creative members have a chance to **EARN while working for their bags**, constant new animations and memes. We're even having a $1,000 Riddle Giveaway (for additional information head over to our official X account) that is ending today, so take a chance with your detective skills, it would be worth it! **Alongside mentioned, team is dedicated and working on technical stuff as well - CEX Listings, partnerships and similair.** So far they've done a great job (4 CEX Listings, PAAL partnership, and more).

**Community—** I'm not overexaggerating when I say that the Hege community is the healthiest community out there. It feels nice being a part of something that doesn't hate or bring down others, but is focused ONLY on positive energy and building itself up. **We're united and hardworking, which is why you've seen us a million times, and why you'll KEEP SEEING US.**

**Community proved the legitimacy of the project by raising a $120,000 in a record time!** The money raised will be used for a BIG CEX listing (last time we were pleasantly surprised and got listed on not 3 but 4 CEXs!). **In addition to the mentioned $120,000, we have a marketing wallet with $90,000 in it.**

We're having a **$HEGE MANIA** week where we'll be deploying a full-out marketing push (we got funds for some **serious** exposure!) that will follow a BIG CEX listing (or listings!). And the fun thing is, Hege Mania starts **TODAY!**

I've said it before, and I'll say it again. There's no project like Hege.

We've got everything it takes for a billion-dollar Market cap, and all we need is a bit of luck. **With our hard work, we're placing ourselves in a position where luck will easily find us!**

An insanely fun week, or rather a conquest, full of action and events, lies ahead for every $HEGE holder.

**Why watch from the sidelines? Join us on our journey to the number one spot.**

You'll surely be rewarded for it!

You probably all heard of Vanity now and what happened to them, but guess what the community is still here and so is the Dev.  
I really think its a great project and needs as much attention as it can get.

**The Idea Behind the Token**

Making something unique. That was the goal when Vanity was made. Vanity is aiming to be the leader in distributing to its customers custom vanity addresses, providing an High Quality service and product.

**Get in now!**

Is recommended to read the litepaper on the website.

You can find the website, and all the necessary information in Vanity telegram channel in the pinned messages. Hope to see you there!

**About Vanity**

Vanity is a token that is intended to fully revolutionize the current system with boring old wallet addresses. How do Vanity intend to do this? The team is able to generate custom addresses based on your own preference utilizing GPU Hash Calculation Power to get a match with your request. Keep in mind this project requires high calculation power, so in order to make it a stable service, the team has already purchased GPU Servers being able to hold the upcoming requests!

**How to make sure that your address cannot be compromised and is Safu?**

The detailed explanation will be given below, but in short it’s actually not that complicated. The user will generate a Private and a public key, using one of Vanity’s tools (Disconnected from the internet). Now the user needs to keep this private key to themselves, and send us the Public key. This is a key that cannot grant anyone access to your wallet, only the private key is able to do this. Now when the team has the public key, they can generate any custom address you want. The team will send you back the generated hash, and combined with your private key, those can be merged in your desired address, making you the sole holder of the private key as well.

**Basic Tokenomics:**

The token has a total supply of 10B tokens At the start 2.5B tokens have been burned. 2% of all transactions go to a burn pool, the tokens will stay out of circulation forever 4% of all transactions will get redistributed over all holders. 2% will go the server bills/marketing wallet

For every purchase made in the store Vanity will also burn 50% of the spent tokens and redistribute another 20% to the holders once more. Making this a very deflationary and rewarding token in general.

This is one of the nicest communities I’ve ever been a part of. We just hit 5,000 holders after a mere 48 hours, and show no sign of stopping. Recent trends show us holding a really nice line and I’m looking at a break out in the next little while. It seems promising to me, especially as the community is active and aware of the need to market as a collective, and are, as I’ve mentioned, extremely welcoming of new dawgs in the park. I’m holding for a while and taking this updog for a long walk. Diamond paws get rewarded with tokens airdropped to EVERY holder from every transaction.

5% of all TX fees will be redistributed back to the contract and will be locked in forever to serve as liquidity, this promotes both buying and selling and overall volume, in order to provide larger liquidity, which opens the door for greater and greater volume.

IMPORTANT INFO:

5,000 holders.  
354,607,899,146,108 tokens burnt at time of writing (35% of total supply).  
Community rewarded 5% airdrop every transaction.  
Currently undertaking an audit with Solidity Finance as we speak, the release of which will be celebrated with a large token burn.  
Already donated 28 BNB to dog shelters in just 48 hours, and much more to come.  
5% of all TX's also get autolocked in the liqduitiy contract.  
Listed on CoinGecko and awaiting news of listing on CMC

281,2021-05-04,"A Paradigm Shift; how can we use it? (Charity Tokens and Sustainable/Ethical Cryptocurrencies)I believe we're a part of a paradigm shift occurring globally and am posting this because I want your ideas, I want to learn about new projects that are doing good and making positive changes to peoples lives and the environment, and that you will share what you've learned along the way.

***What is the paradigm shift?***

We're moving to decentralized technology. The shift aims to remove a central authority and create immunity to government interference or manipulation. Currently, this is fueled by cryptocurrencies such as BTC, Eth, etc shifting the store of value from FIAT, ultimately, allowing these cryptocurrency communities to become the decision-maker.

...so my question is if we're becoming the decision-makers; how do we leverage the capital inflows to change people's lives for the better and help mitigate the impact and risks of climate change?

***What I've learned?***

**1) Why there is so much capital flowing into assets and increasing the price of cryptocurrency:** The world has seen governments ramp up quantitative easing measures across most major countries globally. For example, the U.S with $1.9T, which has resulted in significant capital flowing through the systems; reserve banks buy bonds from gov (which means the government borrows money from the Reserve Bank), who use the borrowed money (bond) and spend it on citizens (stimulus packages, COVID relief, etc), this goes into the hands of citizens.. Governments also buy company bonds (lend companies money) that invest this money into new investments, products, services, or goods to create GDP or simply, pay their staff, etc - which means more people get hired and have money and invest...interest rates are also very low, which means companies (and people) can borrow easily. In layman's terms, a lot of people globally now have discretionary funds to invest, which is why most asset classes (including Crypto) are seeing all-time highs.

**2) Mining is energy-intensive and often bad for the environment**.. with some studies claiming the electricity needed to mine bitcoin is more than used by 'entire countries'.

**3) There has been a recent rise in self-generating liquidity tokens** that redistribute transaction fees to holders to 'moon which seems to be focused mostly on wealth creation - but what about governance, charities/the environment?

**Summary:**

With so much capital inflows into Cryptocurrencies, a major paradigm shift occurring globally to decentralized ways of living we should be starting to think about how can we use this momentum to do better, right?

\> LOOKING FOR PROJECTS FOCUSED ON ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY, CHARITIES & ETHICAL WORK <

When doing some research, I found one that looks legit and some information about coins that don't consume much energy, would appreciate input or feedback:

***Charity Tokens (here is an awesome one I recently found!):*** [***https://www.milktoken.net/***](https://www.milktoken.net/)

**1) Milk and Butter Token (charity token)** that has already raised $25k (which is awesome given they only have a \~$1m market cap) with Food for Life Charity Global (which has projects occupying over 60 countries and volunteers who provide up to 2,000,000 free meals daily!). 

Looks like the token gathers fees on every Butter transaction and the holders of the Butter token can then use their tokens to cast their vote on which charity should receive the next donation.. Tokens are also deflationary so it looks like holders will be rewarded over time.

**2) Sustainable Coins based on Kilowatt hour (KWh) consumed per transaction**

XRP does 0.0079

Dogecoin 0.12

Cardano 0.5479

[This article](https://nft.news/socios-com-enhances-fan-engagement-with-3-new-features/) does a great job of covering the details, I’ll just point out the things that stand out for me personally:



Fan Favorite - It allows token holders to vote on their top player of the game. This could totally change the way Player of The Game/Week/Year is selected in the future.


Auctions - Goal scoring balls, signed jeries and other items can be purchased via online auction and you don’t have to worry about authenticity. Way less friction than what we previously had.


Special treatment for token holders - There are clear incentives to hold or own fan tokens of your favorite clubs. They can give you extra benefits during games and let you participate in a lot of special events organized by the clubs. Considering that most other tokens are pure speculation this is a huge upgrade.

Ankur Shah is the chief auditor who is the CEO of Erience Solutions in New York. The first audit has been completed! This auditing service is poised to set a new benchmark in crypto auditing with in-depth analysis of the audited contract. -The team behind SGE is fully doxxed and there is a great Telegram community involved with the project. The project is audited by solidity.finance with a perfect score: [https://solidity.finance/audits/SGE/](https://solidity.finance/audits/SGE/) In the future, a set portion of the dev/marketing fund will be used to send kids in the United States to Space Camp and for STEM bursaries to support education in the STEM field..

**SGE Design Team is also working on a potential partnership with Tom's Shoes.**

The team is also working with other youtubers and influencers to push out the word about SGE.

Some of these are already confirmed and scheduled for the near future.

Syrius Zenon wallet introduction https://youtu.be/t6A7vKhp-MY

based anon explanation What is it: Incredibly fast, almost infinitely scalable state-of-the-art DLT. It combines the block-lattice architecture that was first(?) used by Raiblocks/Nano with a DAG that exists as a separate layer for the consensus. The block-lattice handles the transactions. It's going to be used to scale Web3 dapps as a L1, and also process transactions as a L2 chain.

Who does it: This is an independent, open-source project and will probably be run by a foundation similar to Ethereum and Cardano, but I'm about 99.5% sure its backed by Square. I can enumerate the zillions of times they have hinted as such if I really have to here, but you can search for old biz posts on Zenon here and also on Warosu.

Square will likely use it to scale Bitcoin transactions where the default payment for merchants and Cashapp users is made in BTC, and then they can set it to dollars or pounds or whatever afterwards.

Its open source and not owned by Square, like how Node.js isn't owned by Google but has wide adoption. They'll easily recruit 1000s of legacy web apps for this bc no code changes are needed, and also dapps on Ethereum will easily switch over.",positive,0.9264272,51

The one exception to this is Jacy token. Everyone there is so helpful and positive.  There is no such thing as a dumb question in there.  It really feels like everyone is there to help each other with whatever their question or issue may be.  The Devs and Mods are always engaged and keep everything going smooth and calm.  

The project is going well and appears to be well thought out and planned in advance. I could type all day but it may be more useful for you to go to jacytoken.io and check out the website. You can read the white paper and roadmap there. You can also join the Telegram group from there.

298,2021-05-10,"SavePlanetEarth (SPE) - Current goal is to plant 1 billion trees, doxed devs, 25m cap.This project may seem too good to be true if you’re used to all the typical meme tokens with absolutely no use cases, therefore I advise you to do your own research on everything mentioned in this post to verify that it is all legitimate. If you want a serious investment you can get into early and grow with, feel grateful you found this post.

$SPE has a **doxed team** of professionals with both the necessary know-how (multiple PhDs and MBAs on the team) as well as the requisite real world connections to be able to establish meaningful partnerships with officials and organizations. SavePlanetEarth has a very active and supportive community and is a registered company in the UK (**COMPANY NO.** 13327811). With your help we will be able to achieve all of our goals together, setting up our future environmentally and of course financially.

$SPE can't be compared to other charity tokens. They aren't just donating money to plant trees. They build partnerships with local organisations and help communities to plant income generating essential trees. They also monitor the tree canopy and conduct scientific data collection of existing biospheres. They’ve already planted over 15,000 trees in climate-endangered regions, like Sri Lanka and the Maldives.

This is a token with long-term vision that is already making a real-world impact today and now – taking its first steps towards the future of fighting climate change with blockchain technology. The first major milestone goal of the project is to plant **1 billion trees**. This is well underway as we partner with the Sri Lankan and Maldivian governments. Celebrities are also catching on too. Tony Hawk replied to our tweet telling us that he took his Cameo money and invested it into $SPE.

Don’t do yourself the disservice of ignoring this post and inevitably hearing about $SPE in the future when it becomes a household name and is already achieving carbon sequestration. You don’t want to be that person that tells people “I could have gotten into that crypto during its infancy and be rich now”. You will also feel great about what you are investing in, as you will be doing your part to help this project on its way to achieving its goals.

Within our first 3 weeks... We have already been listed on Blockfolio, CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko, Coinbase. As well as exchanges such as Pancake swap and Whitebit! (Along with Bitmart, Hotbit and CoinTiger confirmed and going live within the next 7 days).

First on my list is Floki. Yeah,  it’s a meme, but the community is really strong, and they are doing a lot of charity programs in Africa, which means they have good VC backing. I think it might flip Shiba, and it's just about 2B MC.  

The second is QANX; it’s a possible 100X; this one has utility; and its blockchain just got adopted by a country in the EU, which I believe is a huge buy signal. Now that a country has started using blockchain because of its security, I believe banks might get in too soon, and you know what they say: follow where the money goes.   

The last, but not least, is SOL. I wrote a thread a few months ago about this, and whoever ever bought SOL with me at $10 will be in huge profit now. IMO, SOL might flip ETH, as we can see many are beginning to jump on it, and the new memecoin trend will be in the SOL ecosystem rather than ETH.

What are you guys take on Banano? It will never be the new Bitcoin, but do you guys think it’s possible to make any profits on it?

**Who and what?!**

Verasity! A company backed by a CEO that's developed software and hardware for various platforms, including PC/Mac, Android and iOS devices.

Verasity.io is a fast-growing cryptocurrency company in the fields of Esports, video entertainment and advertising. Its mission is to dramatically increase the engagement and advertising revenue of video publishers on any video platform. Verasity. See [coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/verasity)

It received a U.S. patent for its proprietary technology that could help eliminate AD fraud and already has several positive revenue products. On top of that, Verasity recently published the international application of PoV, which will protect PoV internationally. They've also applied for a continuance to the original PoV patent to include NFTs!

**How will all this happen?!**

Through its POV protocol, product layer and platform

* VRA Rewards — Product Layer
* Proprietary video player — product layer
* Proprietary Ad Stack — Product layer
* Proof of View (Patent №10956931) — protocol layer
* POV is the only proprietary protocol layer technology of blockchain
* VeraWallet- Product Layer Payment System
* NFT- Use the POV to verify the chain of custody of NFT. They have applied for a continuance in the PoV patent to include NFTs. This will provide Verasity with protection for PoV’s authentication of NFTs under the same patent.

Oh, and what is excellent about VRA is the incredible community! Check out [Verasity Official Telegram Channel](https://t.me/Verasity_Official)

**Yeah, that is right, we got listed on Coin Base for $Milk, which is invite for application only! $Butter token applications have been sent to CMC and Coinbase (invite only) and pending listing. It is currently sitting at only 1.2M Mcap**

Milk and Butter tokens, for those that haven’t heard, are companion tokens in the Binance Smart Chain with an emphasis on charity giving. Milk is an RFI token that can be staked to generate Butter, which is used to power community voting for their favorite charities on a weekly basis. Those that merely wish to vote may purchase Butter tokens on the open market as well, which also drives rewards for those that stake Milk! [https://www.milktoken.net/voting.html](https://www.milktoken.net/voting.html)

5% of all Milk transactions are guaranteed to go to a charity wallet. In addition, Butter can be used to suggest new charities. [https://www.milktoken.net/suggest.html](https://www.milktoken.net/suggest.html)

$25,000 has been donated to charity so far, with a market cap of only 800K.

The liquidity for both the Milk and Butter tokens is locked away until 2022, at which point both will be relocked. Our Market cap is still low with a solid base, we're building our community for healthy growth, and we’ll continue to develop this project with many exciting use cases plus a full array of features to be rolled out as development completes.

Each week the Milk and Butter token team hosts AMAs with the Developer on Twitch where the community can ask any questions they may have. Occasionally, we have guests, last week the CEO of “Food For Life Global” joined us and explained the amazing genesis of “Food for Life Global” and took viewer questions. Our next AMA is this Sunday at 3am UTC [https://www.twitch.tv/milkbuttertoken](https://www.twitch.tv/milkbuttertoken)

Roadmap: •The first NFTs for voting are already released, You can vote to claim your NFT! •Next week gamification of Butter begins with lotto/bingo games being implemented. •The voting and staking processes will continue to be refined to make the experience as easy and accessible as possible. •Planned instructional content to help those new to crypto learn about the space and how to purchase and use the Milk and Butter tokens.

Accomplishments so far: •Code built from the ground up to develop both tokens. •Unique staking and voting systems implemented. $25,000 donated to various charities in the first month. •Official global charity partnership with “Food For Life Global” being the first of many. •Milk has been [audited](https://dessertswap.finance/audits/Milk%20Token%20BEP-20%20Audit%206361622.pdf) with Butter audit on the way •The developer is [doxxed ](https://christianclaypool.wordpress.com/about/)•Milk and Butter LLC is established with full team being doxxed for next AMA.

I moved the hard drive from an old laptop into my desktop (seemingly without formatting it because all the data is still on it) and I know I never deleted anything that was related, but I cannot find anything except my .bat files I would run to get it all going.

Does this give me a clue of where to start? How was I getting them paid out? I'm so confused and blinded by the potential $$$ I might have lost. 

I read the rules and I didn't quite understand them so sorry about that but here's hoping this works https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dogecoin

320,2021-04-28,"Why I'm invested into $MILK and $BUTTERSo there's this pair of coins called $MILK and $BUTTER which are charity tokens focusing on ending world hunger. They've been out around 1 month, $MILK coming out on March 24th, and $BUTTER coming out April 4th.

What do they do? Well, $BUTTER is the governance token part of the MILK Ecosystem, which allows you to vote for which charity receives the funds that are automatically brought into the charity wallet by the contract. 5% of every transaction with the $BUTTER token is for charity. The process is trustless guaranteeing that those funds do go to charity. But what else is coming? NFT's, as well as gamification of the token with things such as bingo, and a lottery system, also leading to implementation of additional burn mechanics through these games. There is already a .02% burn implemented simply to keep the coin from being inflationary.

As for $MILK, you can stake it through a new staking system called ""churning"" created by lead developer [Cclaypool1](https://christianclaypool.wordpress.com/about/), which allows you to stake up to 50% of your $MILK balance, and earn free $BUTTER. Over 30% of the supply has already been burnt, with over 5T having been burnt in the past week alone.

Some of the amazing accomplishments this team has made include being partnered with a global charity, [Food For Life Global](https://ffl.org/about-us/our-partners-sponsors/), and having donated over $20k with a marketcap that isn't even $1M on either token! Meaning there's still insane room for growth, and also meaning that once we reach tat volume and marketcap which the team hopes to reach, we'd be donating 6-7 digits every week.

There are currently meetings planned with 3 other massive charities, as well as our partner FFLG's marketing team having a meeting about us with Coinbase. And it was also announced that Mr.Beasts team is in contact with our community manager, and these are only a few of the super exciting things coming. $MILK is already [audited](https://www.milktoken.net/files/milkaudit.pdf), with a second audit coming soon, and $BUTTER will be getting audited extremely soon once the ""team"" page is posted on the website since they just became a legal entity. The lead dev is already doxxed as seen above, and the rest of the team will be too soon. There is real value in these tokens, and they aim to change the world.

The strong community has only gotten stronger. We cracked 2M Market Cap in 6 days! If you missed Grumpy or wished for another shot after its crash (like me) then Bingus is for you.

The devs have already donated $350 in ETH to the Wright-Way Rescue. (PROOF: https://imgur.com/GjMOBt5)

The Dev also INSISTS we put this following into any posts about Bingus. They are all about keeping a clean conscience.

“I would not promote anything I would not put my own money into! But, please always DYOR! I am a stranger on the internet, however, I wish to build credibility with the community. I am willing to doxx myself soon if that’s something the community is interested in. I would love to build a community to help donate to animal shelters because that is what is truly important to me.

323,2024-11-11,"Drife – Imagine UBER on blockchain – It’s already a reality! | Currently operational in Dubai with a certified license | TFL license under review in the UK | Crypto payment integration for rides | Over 35k drivers and 350k users onboard | SUI chain | Next 100x
# Look what I found – the famous DRF token is now relaunching on the SUI network! Check their incredible utility and astonishing ecosystem!

**Please connect with the $DRF telegram community. Search for it on Hub below:**

https://hub xyz/drife

**Coinmarketcap:**

[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/drife/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/drife/)

**What is $DRF?**

DRIFE is a decentralized ride-hailing platform that utilizes blockchain technology to create a peer-to-peer network for drivers and riders. The platform operates on the DRF token, which serves as the native currency for all transactions on the platform. The primary goal of DRIFE is to revolutionize the traditional ride-hailing industry by creating a more transparent, secure, and cost-effective system that benefits both drivers and riders.

Unlike traditional ride-hailing platforms, DRIFE is a decentralized platform that eliminates intermediaries, giving riders and drivers more control over their interactions. By leveraging blockchain technology, DRIFE creates a trustless and transparent environment that enables direct peer-to-peer interactions between riders and drivers. This direct connection allows for more personalized and customized ride-hailing experiences, where riders can choose drivers based on specific criteria, such as driver rating, car type, and other preferences.

**What solutions $DRF give to the ride-hailing industry?**

The ride-hailing industry is facing a range of issues that are affecting both drivers and passengers. These issues include high commissions, platform-dictated pricing, lack of transparency and freedom, closed governance, and no loyalty.

We can name few more problems in other competitors – sky-rocketing commissions, platform-dictated pricings, lack of transparency and freedom, closed governance, no loyalty and more.

How does DRIFE deal with those problems exactly?

DRIFE offers innovative solutions to some of the key challenges faced by traditional ride-hailing services. Its zero-commission structure, market-dictated pricing, transparency and freedom to choose an open governance model, and incentivized participation make it a unique and sustainable platform that benefits both riders and drivers.

* No commission - One of the key features of DRIFE is its zero-commission structure. Unlike traditional ride-hailing services, DRIFE does not charge drivers any commission fees for using its platform to connect with riders. This leads to better incomes for drivers who can pass on some of these benefits to riders in the form of reduced commuting costs.
* Market-Dictated Pricing - DRIFE's model offers a unique dynamic pricing mechanism that is based on an auction model. This allows market forces to determine the prices for each ride, rather than a fixed pricing system that is imposed by the platform. The middleman's profit is also eliminated, which means that the prices are even lower for riders, while drivers receive higher incomes for their services.
* Transparency & Freedom to Choose - Transparency and freedom of choice are essential features of the DRIFE platform. The platform's decentralized mobility marketplace and flexible peer-to-peer design give riders and drivers greater control over their experience. Riders can select drivers based on various criteria, such as rating, fare price, pickup time, or specific needs, like child seats or disability access.
* Open Governance - DRIFE's open governance model is a unique approach that aims to create a self-sustaining ecosystem where every stakeholder plays an important role in its growth and maintenance. This is achieved through a franchise model that allows entities such as riders, drivers, fleet owners, and local transportation and logistics companies to govern themselves in a fair and efficient way.
* Incentivized Participation - DRIFE's rewards program is a key aspect of incentivizing participation from both drivers and riders on the platform. By offering rewards for active engagement, DRIFE encourages users to complete rides, provide feedback, and participate in the platform's governance process. These rewards can come in the form of DRF tokens or other perks, which can be used to redeem discounts, free rides, or other benefits

**Do $DRF have a working referral system?**

The Drife team have organized and explained in depth their loyalty and referral system. You can check it out in their whitepaper following this link:

[https://drife.gitbook.io/white-paper/tokenomics](https://drife.gitbook.io/white-paper/tokenomics)

**What is the future development plan of $DRF?**

Integration with other modes of transportation - DRIFE plans to integrate with other modes of transportation, such as public transit, to provide riders with a seamless and convenient end-to-end transportation experience.

* International expansion - DRIFE aims to expand its services to other countries, providing riders and drivers around the world with access to its platform.
* Continued technological Advancements - DRIFE will continue to develop and implement new technologies, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, to improve the ride-hailing experience for its users.
* DRIFE is exploring a new infrastructure layer designed exclusively for mobility, utilizing mobility primitives as a crucial part of the blockchain. This unique approach has the potential to foster innovation in the industry by enabling the community to build mobility-specific use cases.

324,2024-08-05,"Pulse check after the bloodbath!One day ago KENDU was sitting between 121-108 million MC give or take. This was after an already bloody weekend, but then we had a wild morning with BTC dipping below 50K. KENDU dipped all the way to 77 million MC. 

Currently sitting at 100 million MC and I have no idea if this will be the end (BTC found a bottom and reaccumulation starts), but it doesn't matter to the KENDU community. We have recovered well and there is a lot to be really positive about. ****
At time of writing:
-Buys to sells ratio, 2.69:1 (bullish)
-buyer to seller ration, 2.84:1 (also bullish)
-JaredFromSubway is back doing his thing (not confirmed, but I am fairly certain that is his wallet and he really LOVES Kendu)
-MC is down under 10% only in 48 hours
-still the holder count is growing (13613 holders on DEXs)
-Volume is 3.5 million
-Kendu Chads have 3,616/10K NFTs minted (for me the NFT is a means to passive income from the KENDU brand NFT marketplace which goes live after the mint is complete)
-big whale buys happening (10 ETH 10:41am EST) as the appetite for KENDU never stopped

Out of the Telegram for just over 4 hours and
-1417 messages in the main Kendu Inu Ecosystem Telegram
-at least 5 Reddit posts I found and countless KENDU comments (what I found in a shortish check)
THE KENDU army is everywhere sharing this opportunity. I have no doubt we have been working on other socials too probably ones other coins don't even use! We aren't going anywhere.

**My point is that KENDU is a brand, a lifestyle choice that people have committed to in order to run it back like SHIB did, sights set on multi-billions.** We are working to be everywhere and won't let massive market moves stop us. This is bred into our culture and woven into the fabric of the KENDU ethos. Billions and billions in liquidations, people losing their positions and selling, a huge shake up has happened and no matter if it is over or we have more time with more blood, Kendu has the army to endure and to march forward to our goals. 

Peole know about KENDU and clearly have a large appetite for KENDU. This is not financial advice to buy, this is a call to come check out what you are missing!

*Financial advice* Stop messing around with live pairs and pump.rugpull new memecoins. Get off some shitty Jeet chain coin and stop gambling. Many of these coins can't come back from this type of move and you get rekt (all your money is gone). This or very very soon is potentially the last chance to find your horse for the real bull market race and stick with it. You have a chance to change your financial standing if you find something that is a proven winner. 

For me, that winner is Kendu and I sleep well at night knowing I am part of the KENDU Army.

326,2024-06-25,"Quick Rant with a Side of Shill**Brief Background:**

I have been in crypto since \~2017 when I was messing around with ETH and BTC but had to always jeet to get more drinking money in college.

This past winter I finally started looking at meme coins, after thinking they were the dumbest thing ever and a complete waste of time.

I got into a couple that went nowhere and then got into $KENDU (aped in at $4M MC). I wasn't active in the TG but then finally dove into creating a twitter just to shill. This is where the rant begins.

**Rant:**

Crypto Twitter is one of the worst places on Earth. The amount of bottom of the barrel scum there with KOLs dumping their bags on their followers and only shilling once they get paid a free bag is terrifying.

99%+ of the accounts are just engagement farms, sliding into DMs asking to get paid for promotion or just posting ""GM say it back"".

There is no sense of creating anything with longevity, it is always ""Shill me something under $1M MC"" or ""What's the next narrative"". Don’t even get me started on the celebrity meta (waste of time)

Don’t truly know what the point of this rant is, but just wanted to get it off my chest and hear everyone's thoughts. I think at the end of the day KOLs and influencers think they have way too much power and people follow them like sheep  and really are just exit liquidity versus wanting to actually build.

**Side of Shill:**

Will try and make this sound as little like a $KENDU bot as possible and won't put this in our main TG to keep the comments somewhat clean lol.

Being in $KENDU and knowing there has been no paid marketing to KOLs or influencers is what I enjoy the most. Growing the community and coin with no support other than what we do organically feels just like a big middle finger to Crypto Twitter that yes, organic can still work.

Would love for you all to check it out.

STRX - officially the first crypto in space! 

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1b7U65cA8xw&feature=emb_title

“With a partnership and big news ready to be announced, we begin our journey with the relaunch of StrikeCoin, as StrikeX — our upgraded, bespoke and Certik-certified token.”

Today TradeStrike’s new native token StrikeX was listed on [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/strikecoin/)  and has been subject to an exponential rise. It is Currently the #1 top gainer on their leaderboard. 

Over the last week many new eyes have came across TradeStrike, this is apparent with the amount of holders we have gained and the current PPS. With this many new eyes there are bound to be a few of you wanting to do more research.



TradeStrike aims to create a limitless & frictionless trading experience using $STRIKE blockchain; a decentralised approach to trading equities, crypto, NFTs & real-estate.

Whitepaper:
http://trade-strike.com/WhitePaper

Note the new website will include a fully updated whitepaper and roadmap. 

TradeStrike Lite 

The first of their products, TradeStrike Lite, aims to be the leading DEX in the crypto space. Currently in the final stages of development and in the hands of Certik to ensure the highest standards of security. The release of the DEX will be accompanied by their new website which is believed to be far more comprehensive than the current website - including new features, and a lot of information and developments which are being held back! 

The main aims of the team, after security, have been to ensure the best possible user experience and visuals, so I have a feeling this is going to stand out from the crowd. Take a look at their socials to find some teasers, you won’t be disappointed!

The DEX will allow staking which will provide huge incentive to hold onto your coins as well as providing stability to the coin. 

There are also plans for a V2 of the DEX to add some extra features which is said to set it apart from its competitors, there hasn’t been much info given on this so it will be interesting to see what they have up their sleeve! 

Skynet and Certik Shield 

As the leading name in crypto security, TradeStrike have not only acquired the services of Certik to audit their DEX, they will also be using their Skynet and Certik Shield services. This provides 24/7 security monitoring and insurance of any lost or stolen assets. 


StrikeCoin Wallet 

During the recent AMA 2, it was revealed that the StrikeCoin Wallet was fully funded and development has begun by a team from Antier Solutions, a highly regarded blockchain development company, and is expected to be released by the end of 2021, beginning of 2022 at the very latest. The wallet will have the ability to withdraw and deposit using both crypto and fiat assets. With the difficulty surrounding withdrawals and deposits recently, this could be a game changer. A one stop shop for all your crypto needs. 


TradeStrike 

The main platform which is in early development and due for release Q4 2022 of which $STRX will be the native token. This will allow 24/7 trading of crypto, stocks, NFTs & real-estate through the use of Tokenisation and blockchain technology, which is tipped to be a huge industry in the coming years. Working along side one of the biggest law firms on the planet, Latham & Watkins, to ensure regulatory compliance from the start. 


What else? 

With the release of the DEX imminent, this is set to be the start of their first marketing push. Lined up they have a “Top Tier” partnership announcement (have a look at their socials for a teaser - any ideas?)

With the release of the new token, StrikeX contains temporary tokenomics in the form of a tactical 3% selling tax, and a safeguarding 0.5% anti-dump feature that will expire in 9 months, as the flagship product; TradeStrike, prepares for its launch.

The team also added $1m to the liquidity pool, which will be locked for 2 years!

The team have also suggested that the TradeStrike platform is not the end goal, but to eventually operate their own blockchain! 

There has also been a deal made with an unnamed English Premier League footballer (Rumoured starting 11 of a top 4 club) in the excess of 400k tokens. The use of these funds has not yet been decided but has been suggested it may go towards an exchange listing among other suggestions. Not only is this a good boost to the funding of the project, but could prove to be monumental on the marketing side of things. Big money investments if they can tap into this audience even through word of mouth! There is a supposed 3 premier league players invested, along with a player from ligue 1 in France! 

-

I encourage you all to do your own research and pop into the socials for a chat, where the devs and team are very active.

And the trading platform is here: [gains.farm](https://gains.farm/decentralized-trading?a=0xe857cc7ecf1637126db6a1bc15cbb885be838d8f) 


THIS IS NOT A SHILL POST. I have witnessed the mess that leverage trading/futures trading is with the CEXes calling the shots, liquidating positions with scam wicks (yesterday BTC futures spiked to 48k while spot spiked to only 39k) and there is no DEX solution for true leverage trading with high leverage - the few DEX solutions that exist have gaping loopholes, either price is self-calculated, or leverage offered is very small, or they need you to deposit funds into their contract even if you don’t have an active trade on (example dydx)

Below are my findings about gains.farm


1. Leverage trade 21 of the most popular crypto (btc/eth/link/matic/sol/ada etc) with up to 150x leverage right from your wallet without any kyc
2. Supports limit order, stop loss, take profit just like a CEX, but fully decentralised and non-custodial
3. Unlimited liquidity - no order book
4. No funding fee, ever
5. price sourced from top 7 most liquid sources through a custom-built architecture that works with chain link and fetches data real-time with 0 lag
7. Audited 4 times by CERTIK and scores are in all time top 5
8. Operational on polygon for last 6 months - trade with nearly 0 gas cost
9. Main token $GFARM2 has reached its practical max supply at 35k
10. Token has unique burn-mint mechanism - burnt when someone loses a trade, minted when someone wins
11. Since, traders tend to lose in the long run, token is deflationary. In last 6 months, 11% of supply has been burnt
12. If you are a market maker, significant earning potential by adding liquidity to GFARM2-DAI pool in quickswap - 50% of the leverage trading platform’s income distributed to LP stakers
13. Unique NFTs give a boost to the APR (up to 6x boost)
14. Another unique NFT bot let’s you execute other trader’s limit/stoploss/take profit orders and earn a handsome passive income
15. Daily trading volume $10mil/day - huge room for growth available

**Only adult NFT marketplace that accepts the native token as a form of payment.**

As many of you know, a lot of projects on BSC space these days have a very basic mindset. Release a token, hype it up. If it takes off, start putting together a team and thinking of a use case. This has happened with the biggest names in the BSC space and keeps happening. This generally leads to pumps and dumps and most people leave at a loss. We don’t want any of that at xxxNifty.

With OnlyFans moving away from adult content and Visa and MasterCard cracking down on adult site payments portals, now is the perfect time to get on board.

xxxNifty has a different mindset. NFT marketplace was ready and functioning for nearly a month before the release of the token. The marketing budget hasn’t been blown on billboards in Vegas and TikTokers, but rather on porn conventions to get adult content creators on board and to get xxxNifty name out there. Whilst other similar projects release promises of a marketplace, we already sell NFT's.

334,2021-05-20,"420x – picking ourselves up by our bootstraps!Monday evening, three of the five developers went dark after cleaning out the majority of the dev wallet. With the liquidity locked, we have nothing left to lose but everything to gain. Our community has come together, in greater numbers than ever before, and are ready to do what it takes to make 420x live to its potential. 

Tuesday and Wednesday proved that our community has what it takes to overcome this set back as we watched massive buys roll in. We were the green tugboat in the blood ocean. They thought we were down for the count, but we got up, dusted ourselves off, and pulled ourselves up by our bootstraps. 

So, you ask yourself, is 420x over? Finished? Far from it! We are only getting started! With a small marketing budget that will be used very strategically, we’ve organically increased our holders by an average of 800 daily by taking on a community driven guerrilla marketing campaign hitting all of the social media outlets. 

Upcoming announcements and updates in the coming week: 

•  Updated Website
•  Updated Logo
•  Potential NFT fundraiser 
•  New partnership 

Don’t just take my word for it, join the telegram voice chat and find out for yourself!

336,2021-05-04,"GlobalGive [GGIVE] [$2 Million Market Cap] [2 day's old] New BSC token that has the best Tokenomics I've ever seen. Already listed on CoinGecko!GlobalGive: The Token of Choice for Global Charities

GlobalGive is a deflationary token built on the Binance Smart Chain. Investing in this token does not only grow your wealth, but hopefully makes the world a better place, as we donate a percentage of proceeds to a charity to be determined every month. GlobalGive is therefore a rotatory Charity Token representing a ground-breaking option for Charities to raise funds in an ever changing world.

Tokenomics

1.5 Billion Supply (25% Sold at presale)

Presale funds are locked and only release 25% once a month, so it will be 4 months for the presale funds to become completely unlocked. This was done so pre-sale holder cant dump on the new buyers.

5% of supply set aside for charity wallet, 4% set aside for project development wallet (multi-sig process that requires permission from all the founding team members to release any funds from those wallets

10% Tax on SELLING ONLY! NO TAX ON BUYING! (taxes split: 2% redistributed to wallet holders, 2% burned, 6% distributed directly to the locked liquidity pool)

'Toxic Whale Tax', Everybody hates whales that constantly dump on the community. We have developed a progressive tax system that can cost up to an extra 10% in taxes for sales of 1% or greater of the supply. As the tax scales down it is virtually un-noticeable for regular to smaller buys. progressive whale tax splits the same as the standard tax

Max buy/sell limit of 1% of the supply

Anti-Bot Purchase mechanic built into the code (this REALLY helped at launch time)

Other Stats

currently 1178 holders

Market Cap 2M

Liquidity 540k (That's 25.6% backed liquidity!)

Our Mission

At GlobalGive, we are leading the field in using the power of decentralised finance to become the industry-standard for charities to acquire and receive donations – from grassroots non-profits and disaster relief funds to established charities with global reach. Our goal is to provide a platform, driven by our community of GlobalGiver’s, to boost awareness to causes that need it most as well as donating to more charities monthly. We are doing all of the above whilst rewarding investors for simply holding $GGIVE and providing increased investor protection measures. Hold GlobalGive, change the world!

Team is doxxed, any new members that are added to the team are required to doxx themselves as well. Contract Address: 0x60e9880daef10e960da3c45b076dbdac4f111edf

Mine is one of the devs and it’s a solid team. Locked liquidity for 151 years. Coingecko and CMC listings coming soon. Could see a nice run, just figured I would share with you guys. 


https://diamondhandsfinance.io/

What is Diamond Hands Finance? $DMDhands is a slow-burning, high rewards token that will make your hands stronger than ever. A massive 4.75% of every transaction will be redistributed to all holders, giving back to those who don't have paper hands. Diamonds are often sold and lost with time. The longer you hodl, the more valuable your tokens will be. There will be a 0.25% token burn from the total supply for every transaction placed. A lower burn rate than our competitors means a more sustainable, lasting token.

$DMDhands runs on the Binance Smart Chain, this means $DMDhands users can perform swaps and provide liquidity with fast, low cost transactions and get quick confirmations.

$DMDhands team is working to introduce ETH network cross chain implementation, incentives for additional liquidity pools and hosting community engagement events including airdrops. Since this is a community token, holders are encouraged to suggest ideas and ultimately the community will decide in which direction to go. If you want to get early, now is the time. Less than 160 holders but quickly going up.

The bull run is coming. 

The US election, worldwide inflation, the global economy itself has set the stage. We are heading into the greatest interest rate cut cycle in history. Almost every major economy in the world is about to make cut after cut to their interest rates. If you don't know what happens to the investment markets after an interest rate cut, you might want to look in to it.

The US election is shifting its focus massively to cryptocurrency. Regardless of your political outlook, and whether you're American or not, the United States economy is the largest in the world. This US election, and its predictive winner, will absolutely throttle the crypto markets.

And with both of these events coinciding with a BTC-halving year, and the time that the general ""crypto bullrun"" has always been expected, is no coincidence. There are no coincidences. Giga candles will be printed. Faces will be melted. Average Joes will be made into millionaires.

But not everyone. Most people will miss out on it entirely. They will FOMO in at the peak like they do every time, because they didn't pay attention. They didn't listen. The time is right now. Take a look around. Position yourself properly, or spend your days looking at charts after the fact. Wishing you could come back to this moment.

If you're reading this. This is meant for you. Hello my friend. You have less than 24 hours. Steel yourself, because this won't be easy. The markets are designed to prey on human emotion. Your thoughts and feelings themselves will become your greatest challenge.

But it's the only way people like you and I can make it.

Take a look around. Decide where you are going to position yourself. Decide what you are going to put your faith in, and what you're going to bank this opportunity on. If you want help, I'm here to help you.

PDX is looking to become the biggest DEX aggregator and trading platform on Binance Smart Chain.

The dev team is super active on the PDX telegram ([https://t.me/dextalks](https://t.me/dextalks)), and will answer any question you have as best as they can!

PDX launched with a no-presale fair launch on the 16th of september, in a little over a month it rocketed close to $10m in market cap, and it has since corrected to the above mentioned market cap.

I believe that it´s a great buy opportunity because the team is hard working, responsive and doesn´t really care about the price because they are in it for the long term. And so am i!

A little bit of useful info on tokenomics:

\* Liquidity is locked for 5 months (likely to be extended)

\* Fixed max supply: 30,000,000 PDX

\* Circulating supply: 30,000,000 PDX

\* 2% reflection

\* 2% towards liquidity (LP tokens burned)

\* Team allocation: 10% (3,000,000 PDX)

\* Max transaction size: 150,000 PDX

$STRIKE volatilityTradeStrike - DEX release imminent, a huge week ahead! 

Total Supply: 1,000,000,000
Burnt: 112,175,000
Locked: 230,270,566
Circulating: ~657,500,000
Market Cap: ~80m

TradeStrike aims to create a limitless & frictionless trading experience using $STRIKE blockchain; a decentralised approach to trading equities, crypto, NFTs & real-estate.

Whitepaper:
http://trade-strike.com/WhitePaper


TradeStrike Lite 

The first of their products, TradeStrike Lite, aims to be the leading DEX in the crypto space. Currently in the final stages of development and in the hands of Certik to ensure the highest standards of security. The release of the DEX will be accompanied by their new website which is believed to be far more comprehensive than the current website - including new features, and a lot of information and developments which are being held back! 

The main aims of the team, after security, have been to ensure the best possible user experience and visuals, so I have a feeling this is going to stand out from the crowd. Take a look at their socials to find some teasers, you won’t be disappointed!

The DEX will allow staking which will provide huge incentive to hold onto your coins as well as providing stability to the coin. 

There are also plans for a V2 of the DEX to add some extra features which is said to set it apart from its competitors, there hasn’t been much info given on this so it will be interesting to see what they have up their sleeve! 

Skynet and Certik Shield 

As the leading name in crypto security, TradeStrike have not only acquired the services of Certik to audit their DEX, they will also be using their Skynet and Certik Shield services. This provides 24/7 security monitoring and insurance of any lost or stolen assets. 


StrikeCoin Wallet 

During the recent AMA 2, it was revealed that the StrikeCoin Wallet was fully funded and development has begun by a team from Antier Solutions, a highly regarded blockchain development company, and is expected to be released by the end of 2021, beginning of 2022 at the very latest. The wallet will have the ability to withdraw and deposit using both crypto and fiat assets. With the difficulty surrounding withdrawals and deposits recently, this could be a game changer. A one stop shop for all your crypto needs. 


TradeStrike 

The main platform which is in early development and due for release Q4 2022 of which $STRIKE will be the native token. This will allow 24/7 trading of crypto, stocks, NFTs & real-estate through the use of Tokenisation and blockchain technology, which is tipped to be a huge industry in the coming years. Working along side one of the biggest law firms on the planet, Latham & Watkins, to ensure regulatory compliance from the start. 


What else? 

With the release of the DEX imminent, this is set to be the start of their first marketing push. Lined up they have a “Top Tier” partnership announcement (have a look at their socials for a teaser - any ideas?)

This will be accompanied by “never seen before” marketing among other things which have yet to be revealed. Keep your eyes peeled! 

The team have also hinted at the possibility of buy backs and burns in the future. 

They have also just acquired office space in Paddington, London - for the use of hot desks and meeting rooms. I think this just shows the ambition of the team and a sign of things to come! 

The team have also suggested that the TradeStrike platform is not the end goal, but to eventually operate their own blockchain! 

More recently the team have revealed a private deal worth “hundreds of thousands” (dollars?) which is being reserved for adding to the liquidity pool on release of the DEX. The 6.6m StrikeCoins which have changed hands will also be locked for a period of 12 months l. 

There has also been a deal made with an unnamed English Premier League footballer (Rumoured starting 11 of a top 4 club) in the excess of 400k tokens. The use of these funds has not yet been decided but has been suggested it may go towards an exchange listing among other suggestions. Not only is this a good boost to the funding of the project, but could prove to be monumental on the marketing side of things. Big money investments if they can tap into this audience even through word of mouth! 

-

I encourage you all to do your own research and pop into the socials for a chat, where the devs and team are very active.

It is gonna be used as **a swap exchange to buy small cryptos** and will be like pancake swap, except you need to have copiosa coin on an app instead of having to trade bnb to trust wallet and connect to pancake swap.

It’s market cap is **7.4 million** and there are **500 million coins now** and each coin costs about **.015 USD**.

**What is Diamond Hands Finance?** $DMDhands is a slow-burning, high rewards token that will make your hands stronger than ever. A massive 4.75% of every transaction will be redistributed to all holders, giving back to those who don't have paper hands. Diamonds are often sold and lost with time. The longer you hodl, the more valuable your tokens will be. There will be a 0.25% token burn from the total supply for every transaction placed. A lower burn rate than our competitors means a more sustainable, lasting token.

$DMDhands runs on the Binance Smart Chain, this means $DMDhands users can perform swaps and provide liquidity with fast, low cost transactions and get quick confirmations.

$DMDhands team is working to introduce ETH network cross chain implementation, incentives for additional liquidity pools and hosting community engagement events including airdrops. Since this is a community token, holders are encouraged to suggest ideas and ultimately the community will decide in which direction to go. If you want to get early, now is the time. We have over 300 holders in one day and this is just the beginning of a great ride. The website was recently upgraded to better hosting in order to handle all the traffic coming in. Don't forget about the insanely high quality memes already created by the community, join the telegram and see for yourself!

**OFFICIAL MASCOT:** GLORK - https://i.imgur.com/OFepFvL.png

**OFFICIAL $DMDHANDS HOLDER RANKS:**

**Paper Hands:** 0 Tokens. You've either sold or never bought, either way you will be missing this journey to the moon.

**Copper Hands:** 1-49K Token(s). You're finally here, about to strap in for the moon mission. You might be sitting in coach, next to the lavatory, but at least you made it.

**Iron Hands:** 50K-199K Tokens. Business Class isn't too bad on a 3-day flight. You're going to receive an in flight meal, and will live in the suburbs once we get there.

**Steel Hands:** 200K-499K Tokens. Today was a great day. You rode first class to the moon. When you got there, Glork even gave you that little head nod, you know the one that says ""I like you, but not enough to say hi.""

**DIAMOND HANDS** - 500K+ Tokens. You have truly ascended. Your hands are unbreakable. Glork is taking you to leave the moon and continue to explore the universe.

Mavericks NFT tickets and royalties

The question isn’t if the Mavericks are going to use NFTs for issuing game tickets, but when, Cuban told Gary Vaynerchuk in a podcast.

“We will start doing it this coming season, where we’ll issue an NFT after you’ve chosen your ticket on Ticketmaster or whatever,” Cuban said.

According to him, issuing NFTs in such a way, enables them to create an associated value for Mavericks tickets and to keep adding to it.
“There is no limit to the value we can add to it,” said Cuban about his NFT ticket plan that will enable not only Mavericks fans to buy tickets and resell them but it will also make it possible for the team to continue making royalties on them.
According to Cuban, the “hard part” of making it rain with NFTs is figuring out how to move them closer to the origination of the ticket purchase, which will take some time.

Cuban and NFTs

Cuban’s plan to boost the Mavericks’ ticket revenue with NFTs isn’t his first shot in the NFT game. 

As such, the entrepreneur is continuously dropping dimes in the market. Cuban already made a strategic investment in the NFT data aggregator platform CryptoSlam and started building an online gallery for NFT collectors where they can display their most admired tokens.

Milk and Butter tokens, for those that haven’t heard, are companion tokens in the Binance Smart Chain with an emphasis on charity giving. Milk is an RFI token that can be staked to generate Butter, which is used to power community voting for their favorite charities on a weekly basis. Those that merely wish to vote may purchase Butter tokens on the open market as well, which also drives rewards for those that stake Milk!

[https://www.milktoken.net/voting.html](https://www.milktoken.net/voting.html)

5% of all Butter transactions are guaranteed to go to a charity wallet. In addition, Butter can be used to suggest new charities.

[https://www.milktoken.net/suggest.html](https://www.milktoken.net/suggest.html)

$375,000 has been donated to charity so far, at a market cap below 5M. We made crypto history when Butter became the first BEP-20 token to partner with a major food charity: Food For Life Global [https://ffl.org/20077/cryptocurrency-butter-token/](https://ffl.org/20077/cryptocurrency-butter-token/)

The liquidity for both the Milk and Butter tokens is locked away until 2022, at which point both will be relocked. Our Market cap is still low with a solid base, we're building our community for healthy growth, and we’ll continue to develop this project with many exciting use cases plus a full array of features to be rolled out as development completes.

Each week the Milk and Butter token team hosts AMAs with the Developer on Twitch where the community can ask any questions they may have. Occasionally, we have guests, where the CEO of “Food For Life Global” has joined us and explained the amazing genesis of “Food for Life Global” and took viewer questions in one of our AMAs. Our AMA’s stream every Sunday at 3am UTC \[here.\]([https://www.twitch.tv/milkbuttertoken](https://www.twitch.tv/milkbuttertoken))

**Roadmap:**

• This week gamification of Butter begins with lotto/bingo games being implemented.

Secondly, THETA has a deal with World Poker Tour which is owned by Bally/Fox Sports AKA Sinclair Media. Bally Sports also broadcasts Tom Brady's Tampa Bay Buccaneers games.

World might be small, but I don't think its that small. Expect the WPT is Bally Sports/Sinclair Media's way of testing the waters with THETA as a backend streaming platform in addition the NFT options.

Further still THETA is pushing next weeks NFT drops for the WPT games hard, so I'm expecting THETA to get its Coinbase listing as well. There was rumor leaked the listing would happen April 21st from a dev that back this up. It'd be weird if US viewers had to jump through hoops to participate, like especially if we consider(assume) most these poker people aren't as immediately familiar to crypto, so it lines up.

Also the main Theta network Twitter account posted recently to prepare to prefund your accounts with THETA's cash coin TFUEL before the NFT drops next week. Kind of strikes me as an odd thing to say to a predominantly US audience if they can't currently buy the coins without jumping through hoops...

Edit: I've been told and see now the THETA Drop FAQ says people will be able to direct purchase, but it doesn't specify if it's for TFuels or NFTs directly. Even if we don't get a Coinbase listing, which I still think is gonna happen sooner rather than later, we'll at least get more intuitive access to the THETA ecosystem for the US. The way they've phrased prefunding the account to me implies direct TFuel purchasing because what would be the point of prefunding a cash balance with a credit/debit card that can already have an immediate transaction.

Edit2: I've seen multiple reports of liquidity issues over the last week or so trying to purchase THETA via SimpleSwap. 

Edit3: Binance unstaked 33M tokens a month ago implying liquidity was aggressively needed.

ChatGPT is problematic because there are privacy violation concerns surrounding it, Google's AI has racial bias built into it... And this is just the tip of the iceberg because the underlying problem is the data these models are trained on.



That same article mentions Qubic as an example of how crypto can help AI become more accurate and efficient but I'm sure there are other examples out there. I'm just curious to hear your thoughts on this. Can crypto help AI become what it is meant to be or is it just doomed to fail?

372,2023-03-23,"Spring portfolio hunt for the real bull runWe all already have plans for what we want to have in our bags for the next bull. Some tokens have already been accumulated… others will be purchased after a market correction. However, we always leave room for a few gems in our bags (at least I do).

I want to share some projects that I’m keeping on my watchlist for this case.

**AI:**

This could be the leader in the next bull market and I think projects centered around AI could be a good investment. I already made some decent profits on some of them - OCEAN and GRT are my picks from this area.

**DeFi:**

In this sector, I’m really bullish on AAVE. I think it will reach a new ATH, and perhaps hit the $1K mark.

**Layer 0:**

ATOM and DOT aren’t moonshots or anything, but I see them as strong projects that give provide high APYs for staking. It makes it much easier to hold during the whole bear market, so I’m filling a portion of my bags with these gems.

**Layer 1:**

EGLD. Its ATH is 10x from here - in the previous bull run, this project nearly had nothing developed in its chain. Now it looks more robust, with a lot of development in progress. They built a lot during the bear market and, if they hit again at ATH, I will be more than happy.

I have a bag of QANX too, which is another Layer 1 but in the testnet phase. However, they already have partners that will use their private blockchain. Also, it's followed by some unique features such as coding in any programming language and mining and validation with a phone. Even though it's 15x from its ATH, it's a low cap and could get much higher.

**Last but not least, an NFT marketplace:**

POOP - it's nothing as you would assume from the name. This will be something like an OpeanSea for the Polkadot ecosystem. Although it’s not that far from the ATH, however, it's a low cap, so it can go much higher.

Are you bullish on one specific crypto area, or do you prefer diversification? Which alts are you keeping an eye on?

As usual, not financial advice, I'm not an advisor and I will not tell you what to do with your money, do what you want, like buying something nice for your mother. This is also a reminder, when was the last time you bought her something?

Back on topic, so a couple of days ago I presented you with the UNITi Protocol. I thought it was a neat token, nice aesthetics and chill crew. In that post I posed the question ""is it worthy of your money?"" and at that time the Telegram had something like 800 members, the price was around 60 cents and I said that I was here for the long run. And guess what? We had a new ATH today of 3.42 USD. So, yeah... That happened.

There is a lot of marketing and contests going on, we had an airdrop recently. I'm watching how they manage this token quite closely and they are making some amazing progress really.

I'm telling you right now, we are still early, this looks like it’s still going to keep growing as the LP gets bigger with each TX and the community is getting better and better each second.

383,2023-12-19,"Here are my top altcoin picks for next year As you can see, there is a high chance of having a bull run soon, as BTC has shown a good price move to the upside for several months now. IMO, it's wise to start accumulating gradually.  

But the real question is what to buy and why I think it’s the best option. I will only be listing the two tokens I’m accumulating now. One is a large cap, and the other is a low cap. Both are my biggest bags, and if you do proper research, you will agree with me that they have a high chance of leading the next bull run.  

The first is SOLANA; it's funny because I personally FUD SOL a few months ago before it had that huge price move back up. Recently, I have noticed SOL has started gaining a lot of traction, and memecoin is now gradually shifting from ETH to the Solana ecosystem. If this trend continues, then a lot of people will end up buying into SOL, and I predict the price will be around $500 for its next ATH.   

The second, which is a low-MC gem and is gradually gaining traction, is QANX. It’s a layer 1 hybrid blockchain that is EVM-compatible. One of the features about it that I feel will blow up so much is the fact that it allows developers to code smart contracts in any programming language, which QAN aims to use to onboard over 20 million developers into the blockchain, which I believe even If they are able to achieve 10% of that, then this layer 1 blockchain will be greater than ETH. And my price prediction for QANX is $1 in the next bull run.  

Anyway, please feel free to share with me what altcoins you are buying as well.

**What is $AVENT?**

Aventa team is developing a Layer 1 blockchain. It will operate as an independent blockchain with its own consensus mechanism and infrastructure.

The Aventa Layer 1 is the base layer of the blockchain network, which will operate independently. Examples of this include Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Solana, Avalanche, and Bitcoin.

**What are the advantages of building a Layer 1 chain?**

* Decentralization & Security: Since the Aventa Layer 1 blockchain is the foundation, it will offer stronger decentralization and security (an example is Ethereum's strong network security).
* Direct Development: With the $AVENT chain, developers have full control over the protocol and can implement base-layer changes or improvements without relying on another layer.
* Independent Ecosystem: Aventa being a Layer 1 chain, it will have its own native ecosystems with a variety of applications (DApps, DeFi protocols, NFTs) built directly on them.

392,2023-07-18,"Blockchain launch that everyone should keep an eye on We see a lot of Layer 1 popping out lately, and I completely understand why people are wondering, ""Do we need all of them?""  
Of course, not all of them will have success, but I would like to share some information about upcoming updates from QANplatfrom, which I believe should have huge success!  


I am not going to do a deep dive into some of the tech behind it. Long story short, it will be EVM-compatible and quantum-resistant. One of the strongest selling points is definitely a multi-language feature, which will allow developers to code in any language based on Linux!  


They will have both private and public blockchains, and this is the information I would like to share with everyone. A private blockchain launch should happen in a few weeks, and that could draw more attention to the project. There is one big partnership in the pipeline, but the team never disclosed the name of the partner. They are probably under NDA, but according to the team, it will be someone big.

Following the upcoming hype, I believe this will reflect on the QANX too.  
Since June, the price has been going up gradually. I've made 2.5x until now, but I believe more will come. Considering that Layer 1 has many interesting USPs and their token is sitting on a $40 million market cap, I think anything under 5–10x before the mainnet launch is undervaluing it.

How many of you are also holding this or perhaps waiting for some correction to ape in?

393,2022-10-04,"It's an open discussion, what are your plans ahead of the coming bull run, are you buying anything now or not?I remembered the last bear market when a friend advised me to buy ETH, but I was hesitant. My first purchase later was around 3000, and I planned to hold to 10K if possible, but the bear market had other plans. To avoid repeating the same mistake, I've decided to conduct research, compile a list of a few good crypto projects that I believe will lead the next bull run, and then ask you guys to vote on which ones you think are good and which ones you think are bad.

The first on my list is potential Solana. I know some people don't like it because of centralization issues and the fact that it has had a few shutdowns, but I believe it's a great blockchain with a lot of great potential. I have DCA from $60, and I may still buy more. Some advantages of SOL include its high scalability, which makes Solana a better blockchain for Dapps such as DEXs and staking protocols.

The following is DOT. Polkadot should not be overlooked either, as it has a fantastic community. It is designed to allow unrelated blockchains to securely interact with one another, allowing value or data to flow between blockchains without the need for an intermediary. It's also intended to be fast and scalable, thanks to the use of numerous parallel blockchains or ""parachains"", that offload much of the processing demand from the main blockchain. Dot has an ATL of $2.69, so buying at $6.27 now isn't a bad idea. I just want to start DCA-ing DOT this month.

I also discovered a low-cap project called Qanplatform. It's a layer 1 quantum-resistant blockchain, which you may have heard of. It recently released QVM, which allows developers to code smart contracts in any programming language. In comparison to EVM, which only allows programming in Solidity, this could be huge for the crypto space in general. It also has several other USPs, such as the quantum-resistant features I mentioned above, which make this chain one of the most secure ever and not hackable by a Quantum computer. I've had DCA-ing QANX since it was 0.014, and I'll be buying more this month to hold for the long term.

The fourth one is MoonRiver, an Ethereum-compatible, smart-contract parachain on Kusama. It is intended to be a companion network to Moonbeam, where it will provide a permanently incentivized canary network. The token name is MOVR and it has several utilities for this decentralized smart contract platform.  I did buy some for around $15 and am still looking for more if possible.

The last one is a meme called TSUKA. It has the same founder as Shiba and I will be gambling in on that, hopefully, it will become the next Shiba.

So guys, what do you think, I’m I good to go? Do I need to add any other gem before the bull run, let me know in the comment section

Analysts cautioned that investing in meme tokens is not always a safe bet. Many people, I was informed, would bet on these coins in the hopes of choosing the next Doge or Shiba, and many of them would be burned. That may be true, but there are more opportunities to invest in and get wealthy now than there have ever been. You may make money by investing in the stock market, real estate, or cryptocurrencies, but in 2021, the most interesting alternative was to invest in Shiba Inu, Doge, or [Mononoke Inu](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/mononoke-inu/) meme coins. They demonstrated last year that there was plenty of opportunity for expansion. 

  
Industry representatives stressed the importance of caution when choosing which tokens to invest in and avoiding scams such as ""rug pulls,"" which refers to scenarios in which developers abandon a project and walk away with investors' funds. Finding the right meme currency to invest in is getting harder, but the more the risk, the larger the potential reward.

TradeStrike aims to create a limitless & frictionless trading experience using $STRIKE blockchain; a decentralised approach to trading equities, crypto, NFTs & real-estate.

Whitepaper:
http://trade-strike.com/WhitePaper


TradeStrike Lite 

The first of their products, TradeStrike Lite, aims to be the leading DEX in the crypto space. Currently in the final stages of development and in the hands of CertiK to ensure the highest standards of security. 

The main aims of the team, after security, have been to ensure the best possible user experience, so I have a feeling this is going to stand out from the crowd. They leave no stone unturned. Take a look at their socials to find some teasers, you won’t be disappointed. 

The DEX will also allow staking which will provide huge incentive to hold onto your coins as well as providing stability to the coin. 

This is going to blow PancakeSwap out the water! 


StrikeCoin Wallet 

During the recent AMA 2, it was revealed that the StrikeCoin Wallet was fully funded and has begun development and expected to be released before the end of 2021. The wallet will have the ability to withdraw and deposit using both crypto and fiat assets. With the difficulty surrounding withdrawals and deposits recently, this could be a game changer. A one stop shop for all your crypto needs. 

Think MetaMask and Trust Wallet but better! 


TradeStrike 

The main platform which is in early development and due for release Q4 2022 of which $STRIKE will be the native token. This will allow 24/7 trading of crypto, stocks, NFTs & real-estate through the use of Tokenisation and blockchain technology, which is tipped to be a huge industry in the coming years. Working along side one of the biggest law firms on the planet, Latham & Watkins, to ensure regulatory compliance from the start. 

Dare I say, watch out Binance, Robinhood and Trading212 


What else? 

With the release of the DEX imminent, this is set to be the start of their first marketing push. Lined up they have a “Top Tier” partnership announcement (have a look at their socials for a teaser - any ideas?)

This will be accompanied by “never seen before” marketing among other things which have yet to be revealed. Keep your eyes peeled! 

The team have also hinted at the possibility of buy backs and burns in the future. 

They have also just acquired office space in Paddington, London - for the use of hot desks and meeting rooms. I think this just shows the ambition of the team and a sign of things to come! trending

The team have also suggested that the TradeStrike platform is not the end goal, but to eventually operate their own blockchain! 

-

I encourage you all to do your own research and pop into the socials for a chat, where the devs and team are very active. 

We are so early here, TradeStrike is going to be huge!

[https://fegtoken.com/](https://fegtoken.com/)

* **Pairs**   can choose a staking pool that allows your token holders to  stake and   earn fBNB/fETH or any base fWRAP directly, or you can choose  to  bypass  it and earn 0.2% of all sells directly into a team wallet for    marketing, charity, or project developments.
* **Pairs**   have the ability to open a staking pool if they ask for one and  met   the criteria. The token holders will earn fBNB/fETH or any base  fWrap   directly. Tokens that have reflections will continue to earn    reflections while being staked! This alone is the world's first in this    space. Another element that no other exchanges are doing is the fact    that per default the 0,2% are set to pay the developers of the token    directly! If the developer wants more he can set his pair up to 1% on    each sell. If he wants nothing he can set it to 0%.
* **SmartSwap**   technology allows users to standard swap or ""smart"" swap.  SmartSwap  is  designed for swing traders and offers up to 50%+ less gas  and saves   transaction fees on frictionless tokens while internally  swapping   inside the swap contract.
* **Internal liquidity locking**   features are built to streamline the process tremendously.  Each  new   pair created on FegEx will have a 1 year lock build in the  exchange.   Every extension of the lock will guarantee a further 1 year  lock. The   exchange will also show how much liquidity is locked on the  exchange.
* Pairs   are based upon fWRAP technology, which earns transaction  rewards from   every use directly inside each liquidity pool. In turn,  this  generates  perpetual positive price pressure on all listed tokens   sharing the same  base fWRAP. For instance, if one pair has a $100M  daily  volume and  your token shares the same base pair, all of their   transactions will  also reward your pool's liquidity, raising the price   of your token.  This model provides a true evolution that has never  been  provided  before.
* **Smart-rising floor**:    A  percentage of each sale remains in the liquidity, which raises the    price automatically after every sale without any gas cost. Newly  listed   tokens on FEGex will have the ability to allocate a percentage  of fees   to automatically add to its liquidity, creating a smart rising  price   floor. Many competitor tokens already have something similar in  place;   however, their system is set up where they automatically buy  with 2.00%   of each sale. This process takes up to five (5) steps to  complete on   competitors’ infrastructure. With FEGex, the process  requires zero (0)   steps - since it is built-in!
* **Auto-slip** technology allows users to never have to fumble around with all of the errors that they receive on other swaps.
* Front-running   bot protection - Our priority is the security of all  community  members  and investors’ assets; this feature shines when it  comes to  protecting  liquidity pools!
* The   ability to utilize FEG perpetual faucet technology (FEGfaucet)  allows   users the ability to claim free tokens. Every day. Forever.    (Seriously.)
* **FEGtrack**   will allow listed tokens on FEGex to list their token on the    application, so all users can easily track token rewards and    statistics.
* **Fegstats**:    Professional  charting that will help with FegEx's ecosystem.   Basically, everything  you are used to do on Tradingview will be able to   be done on Fegstats as  well. This will also help the exchange with a   professional chart inside  of the professional (free) version.

**SmartDeFi**    The World's First ALL-in-ONE SmartDeFi Ecosystem Introducing the    first-ever frictionless token with its trading and liquidity - all    within a single ecosystem! There is no longer a need to pick where to    host trading. On-Token-hosted trading can now be performed globally.

**Elimination of Rugpulls**

This    code eliminates the ability to rug since its trading system is not    hosted via a third party. The token contract now owns its liquidity,    making it impossible to rug! Eliminating liquidity provider (LP) tokens    while fully empowering safe liquidity.

**Routing Features:**    All  SmartDeFi and FEGex pairs can send and receive SmartFunds to and   from  each other. This allows Peer-to-Peer (P2P) and Swap-to-Swap  (S2S)   transfers of SmartFunds anywhere within FEGex and SmartDeFi  networks.

Peer-2-Peer

Swap-2-Swap

**SmartSwap-Enabled**

**SmartSwap  technology**   has been added inside the token hosted swap protocol  offering record   gas savings. Swing or day trading can be done inside the  On-Token Swap   protocol, providing countless savings while frequently  trading.

**SmartSwap directly Rewards FEG Staking Pools:**    The  same 0.12% sell fee built within FEGex that rewards FEG staking   pools  is built inside ALL SmartDeFi tokens, which supports the  increase  in  rewards within the FEG Token ecosystem.

**fWrap-Enabled:**    All  SmartDeFi Tokens are built to run seamlessly with fWrap-based   assets.  This means that all trading performed universally on the same   base  assets provides positive price pressure on ROX and every token   launched  on SmartDeFi. Since the base fWrap collects rewards, the   rewards  originate from the token’s liquidity, giving a perpetual price   increase.

**SmartDeFi Tokens are 100% ASSET-BACKED!**    Every  SmartDeFi token is fully backed by its base asset,  guaranteeing  the  tokens’ baseline value is secured from suffering  loss. Base assets  are  what assets the tokens are traded against (for  example,  fBNB/fETH). A  set percentage of every BUY/SELL is given to  the  asset-backing pool  which is secured inside the SmartDeFi tokens’  smart  contract. This  results in a perpetual increase of the SmartDeFi  tokens’  baseline value,  resulting in the formation of a baseline value  that  can never decrease  (Seriously!)

The   asset-backing can  be recovered instantly by burning SmartDeFi tokens   for their share of  asset-backing. When SmartDeFi tokens burn for their   backed asset, it  creates a “black hole” that burns more and more  tokens  automatically and  effortlessly over time. Burnt tokens forward  their  backing to the  remaining tokens, increasing the backing per  token  faster. This  guarantees that every SmartDeFi token will always  have  value, regardless  of the market price!

**Since   all  SmartDeFi tokens are based on fWrap technology, their market  price  even  rises when there is zero (0) volume. SmartDeFi ""DeFi""es the  law  of  physics - when any tokens are sold the baseline value goes up   instead of  down. SmartDeFi also helps to eliminate pump-and-dump   schemes. With the  baseline value being transparent, buyers know what   the risk ratios are  even before trading**

If you aren’t familiar with the project they are basically working on a flagship product that users can then distribute around the world and earn commissions in perpetuity.

406,2024-04-27,"Memecoins performance after halving?Hello everyone, in this thread I would like to discuss memecoins that blew out this year and have changed the lives of many people.

I started buying crypto in 2019 but I personally don't invest much in smaller memecoins because they are risky and unreliable, but when I discover one that has huge potential, a great community and a strong dev team, I can't help myself and have to buy smaller amounts and watch these tokens increase in value 10x, 50x or even 100x

This year we've seen several memecoins (BOME, MEW, BRETT, etc.) absolutely explode in price, even before Bitcoin's halving. Therefore, I believe we will see dozens more memecoins do the same this year.

In this part of my post, I would like to share with you three memecoins that caught my attention recently. I am not advertising these tokens there or telling you to buy them, always DYOR and never listen to random people you don't know, I just want to know your opinion and provide you with some  information after watching and studying these tokens for weeks.

The tickers are PONKE ([https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ponke/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ponke/)), POWSCHE ([https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/powsche/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/powsche/)) and LINU ([https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/luna-inu-/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/luna-inu-/)). 

Some of you can be familiar with PONKE. It is a bigger token aimed at normies with its strong game on instagram, tiktok and twitter. It is already listed on bigger exchanges like Gate, HTX or MEXC.

https://preview.redd.it/2vntmntr71xc1.jpg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f414106192574b000af3911408ac718285b58f3c

POWSCHE is a smaller market cap token with a community that is usual for much bigger coins and an  ambitious dev team working hard. They have big goals such as Tesla burning at 50mil market cap and Lambo burning at 100mil market cap, also the fact that it's the first car based memecoin specifically focused on car guys can be extremely beneficial.

https://preview.redd.it/s78ixd6t71xc1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a5c393d687cb0fa38e9fc2b06138f1e575d76e22

LINU is the only community driven token. It is already listed on Bitmart and according to the admins big things are coming. Biggest green flag of this coin is its huge liquidity and holder count. The admin team is strong and I believe they will achieve many goals this bullrun.

So, what do you think about these coins? Feel free to discuss other tokens under this post. I find it interesting to find out different information about memecoins so if you have some leave a comment.

411,2021-10-12,"How Risky Is Altcoin Investing? A Historical Data Analysis of Altcoins in Bear MarketsThis was originally posted on my altcoin analysis newsletter, [Crypto Pragmatist.](https://CryptoPragmatist.com/sign-up/) We write institutional-grade altcoin investing content for retail investors.

&#x200B;

**How do altcoins perform in a bear market?**

As altcoin investors, we sometimes are on the butt end of some criticism. Sure small-cap cryptocurrencies can outperform Bitcoin in a bull market, but what about when the market tanks? What does altcoin investing look like when things are less-than-bullish?

After writing [this post](https://cryptopragmatist.com/2021/09/how-bad-is-an-altcoin-bear-market/) on altcoins in bull markets, I wanted to follow up with a data-backed look on the same assets in bear markets.

**The Parameters**

This analysis is based on three points in time:

https://preview.redd.it/4pfbrm8bv3t71.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=904f74a0b981a84caa0142bd97ed320fdc436637

The first date is Bitcoin's 2017 high point, nearly universally considered the ‘cycle peak’ of the last bull market.

By the next December, the market was in pretty horrible shape, wicking down to about $3500, one time in December 2018 and another time in January 2019. We'll use the January 2019 date for our 'market bottom' analysis.

The final date is September 13th, the date I'm using for the present.​

&#x200B;

**Phase One: The Bear Market (December 2017 - January 2019)**

First up? The small-cap altcoins, position 101-200 by market cap. We buy them for one reason: crazy returns in the bull market. But is it a different story in the bear market?

**Absolutely.**

The average return of these assets from market peak to market bottom? Negative 90%. The best performer (KuCoin) dropped 37%, and 20 of the coins are worth less than a cent. 99 of the 100 have gone down over 50%, and a minority (37 of the 100 coins) have dropped less than 90%.

An investment of $1,000 in each one of these coins ($100,000 total) at the peak would be worth a mere $10,480: at the bottom of the market cycle, it’s hard to feel good about your altcoin portfolio.

Things are looking not-that-great for altcoins. But to be fair, we haven’t yet looked at how the top 100 coins have held up either.

Here’s a table of returns over this timeline by cohort, including top-two cryptos Bitcoin and Ethereum.

https://preview.redd.it/uhl9h40ev3t71.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=231b7807e0d1beccb14e301458c5ca82477954eb

Ok, so it turns out it's pretty bad no matter what, but the top 100 cryptos have held up a bit better: the top-100 portfolio of $1,000 in each coin is worth about 60% more than our small-cap crypto portfolio ($16,499 to $10,480).

Just six of the top 100 have dropped by over 99%, while twelve of the small-caps have performed the same (depressing) feat. Only two non-stablecoins have produced positive returns, both of them in the top 100 ([$BNB](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/binance-coin/) starting at #36 and [$LINK](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/chainlink/) starting at #91).

And you’d be right to be bearish on altcoins in this time period. Here’s a graph of the top 200 coins and their average returns. I’ve also performed a linear regression on the data.

https://preview.redd.it/wadt82wev3t71.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=744ffeaf2d82a28a5a44f71ba2d4815a049a2131

The altcoin critics have largely been proven right: in an extended downward market slump, the data argues you’re better off by quite a bit by investing in larger market caps. A random investment in the top 100 is half as likely to go to zero as a random investment in the next 100. But either way, things are not great.

While many in the crypto world advocate for Bitcoin as a relatively safe asset, it’s still performing really poorly, disastrously so, compared to nearly any other asset. Over this same time period, the S&P 500 only lost about 5%. Peak to trough in the great recession, the S&P 500 dropped 57.7%. That’s painful, but not as painful as 90%.

&#x200B;

​​​**Phase Two: The Peak to Today (December 2017 - September 2021)**

**​​**Realistically, it’s pretty universally assumed that altcoins bleed more than blue chips during a bear market. That’s a granted, and it’s part of the reason altcoins move up quicker in bull markets.

But perhaps the most interesting data comes from a HODL (hold-on-for-dear-life) approach. How do these coins perform top to bottom to top again? Do altcoins eventually bounce back? Or will these once-hot assets drop off the map, never to be seen again?

Here’s the same graph with a linear regression:

https://preview.redd.it/9s0t1xzuv3t71.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a2343e7157f65503d570dd93d9b9fe3bc54e657

Again, we have a negative slope on the graph, meaning that larger market cap coins on average do better over this period. But the data doesn’t seem to point out the theory posited by altcoin critics, summed up by the following quote:

>**""Shitcoins are made to get in when they're trash and get out when they're in a bubble.""**

But data shows that this might not be true. Altcoins don't die forever. Small-cap altcoins don't rebound as hard, but they don't disappear either. Here are some of the averages by cohort where we can take a closer look:

https://preview.redd.it/i4kxubd5w3t71.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=18bb3c0f1bad17f919d55811c83e646646cb6d13

This data definitely proves at least one thing for me: a diversified portfolio of altcoins outside of the top 100 is not going to become worthless, not by any means. The portfolio isn’t thriving, that’s for sure: 20 of the top 100 have lost over 99% of their value, and only 7 of the coins have 2x’d or better. But a portfolio that returns over 50% in a few years isn’t something most people complain about.

That being said, this point in the cycle is definitely where the Ethereum and Bitcoin bulls are getting their revenge. Both of those cryptos performed well above average. But lower market-cap altcoins seem to perform comparably to the top 10 cryptos on average, and both of those performed comparably to the S&P 500 (65%).

**​**

**Trough to Today (January 2019 - September 2021)**

>**""Bull markets can make you money, bear markets will make you rich.""**

Obviously, it’s impossible to predict the bottom of a market cycle, and it’s really hard to have the cojones to buy altcoins there, but for fun, let’s imagine we can perfectly time the market, and buy coins at the exact bottom. What will do better? The top 10, the top 100, or the next 100?

Keep in mind, for this experiment, we’re buying the new ranking of coins, not the old ones. Here’s that graph:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9yy9n1c8w3t71.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=1531f07cdf749152a967458ac6a94da01e329504

And some cohort averages:

https://preview.redd.it/4bjlmp8aw3t71.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0bf2ddd4e902ca416f00f080582b7afa2ed9803

Those are some pretty powerful returns for the second cohort. Spreading $100,000 evenly across those ($1000 in every crypto) would today yield you over 2.1 million dollars. Even throwing the whole wad in Bitcoin would net you a cool $1.2 million, so I guess I won’t blame you if you only want to invest in $BTC. Me, myself, I’ll continue to chase those 100x gains.

Some stats by cohort:

* Six of the top 100 have gone to zero, compared to eight of the next 100
* Both cohorts have 12 coins returning over 15x
* 61 of the top 100 have returned over 100%, compared to 34 of the next 100
* The second portfolio’s gains are primarily driven by coins that return over 40x, like [Quant](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/quant/), [Theta](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/theta/), [Enjin Coin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/enjin-coin/), and [Telcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/telcoin/).

**The Lessons**

I think the lesson in this analysis I’ll take away is that there’s certainly a strong case for keeping your money in Bitcoin and Ethereum. They’ve got lower downside risk and will likely bounce back stronger than the average altcoin.

But those up and comers, those altcoins floating around outside the top 100 are awfully tempting to invest in if you’re looking to create incredible returns. That’s easier said than done, but a diversified portfolio backed up with strong altcoin research is a good place to start.

Since 2016, GET Protocol has issued over 700,000 digital tickets (all registered on chain) to unknowing event attendees across several countries.

From stadium concerts and massive raves to small theater and comedy shows, hundreds of thousands of attendees have already experienced the benefits of GET Protocol’s innovative tickets. And we’re only just getting started.

All GET-powered events, with unknowing early adopters of kick-ass blockchain tech.

Finding a home for our NFT Tickets has been a long process that has given us a vast insight into the various platforms currently available. It has always been our prerogative to ensure that the platform of choice provides stability whilst being a scalable solution that supports our blockchain activity, ranging from our current NFT registration to our upcoming DeFi plans. With this said, we’re happy to announce today that we’ve found a platform that goes above and beyond this criteria and our NFT Tickets are settled in and ready to ticket events. That home is of course Polygon!

Background on Polygon

So what is Polygon? Polygon offers a multi-chain scaling solution that combines the best of Ethereum compatible blockchain networks with an interoperable protocol that has been designed for a scalable and flexible experience. What this means is that Polygon essentially offers blockchains that run alongside the Ethereum mainchain, which are faster and cheaper than the mainchain itself. Users can bridge between the Ethereum mainchain and Polygon sidechains in order to have a quick and easy way of transacting without heavy fees.

Why GET Protocol Benefits From Polygon

Our NFT Ticketing solution requires a platform that can support the growth in volume of ticketing whilst providing unwavering stability without compromising on decentralisation. With a system that has such good interoperability with the Ethereum chain, it is notable how many large and reputable projects are moving to Polygon. These projects feature helpful services to GET Protocol, such as various DeFi tools which are useful for us as we further move towards our decentralised financing services. It’s always good however to again re-iterate that we are a blockchain agnostic project and will always be looking at ways we can implement projects and tools that can benefit the ticketing experience we provide.

How GET Protocol’s NFT Ticketing Benefits Polygon

GET Protocol is of course bringing a real world, industry disrupting system to the Polygon chain. Our NFT Tickets introduce a novel use case that many in the NFT community have not discovered currently. By integrating onto the Polygon chain, we’re showing to the wider cryptocurrency community that Polygon is a platform that businesses can trust and rely upon for their blockchain needs. With 700,000+ tickets sold through the protocol to date and many more to come, we believe this is a great vote of confidence for Polygon.

For those wondering about the benefits of NFT Tickets.

What is to come?

The arrival at Polygon will take place upon the launch of our new NFT Ticket explorer, which is is set to be released in a matter of days. Not only will ticket holders and others interested in the protocol be able to track all NFT ticket activity, the explorer will also open the door to NFT collectibles linked to real world experiences. We’re of course working closely with the Polygon team to highlight this partnership and ensure a good working relationship as we move forward. It also goes without saying that now we’ve fully integrated our ticketing onto Polygon, we are working hard to open up discovery of NFT Ticketing to the wider community and bring this exciting use case to everyone looking to further the expansion of blockchain adoption.

413,2021-05-18,"Deep Dive on Solana ($SOL)- NOT a Shitcoin and The Most Undervalued Top 15 Altcoin (IMO)Hello! Wanted to share my thoughts on Solana, a blockchain platform that I believe has the most upside potential of the top \~15 cryptocurrencies currently on the market.

Coinmarket Cap Link - [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/solana/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/solana/)

**The Founding Story (**[Source](https://docs.solana.com/history)**)**

* **Solana's Founder Anatoly Yakovenko spent the bulk of his professional career at Qualcomm, Dropbox, and Mesosphere** where he spent a lot of time designing distributed systems and figuring out how to get different systems of software and hardware to talk to each other
* It was at Qualcomm that Anatoly met two of his other **Solana co-founders, Greg Fitzgerald and Stephen Akridge** and the three of them spent nearly a decade working together
* **Greg had an expertise in languages** and compilers and he convinced Anatoly to migrate Solana’s codebase from the C programming language to Rust and became the CTO of Solana
* **Stephen led the GPU backend that constantly beat Nvidia** and he demonstrated that massive amounts of time could be saved through GPUs leading Anatoly to recruit him to the team in early 2018
* The **Solana founding team had about a decade of experience working together** solving complex software and hardware problems at Qualcomm and **you don’t find many founding teams with such deep qualified shared work histories like this in the crypto space**
* Solana was the name of a beach in San Diego where the three of them would often surf so the name doesn’t really have particular significance beyond that

**Proof of Work vs. Stake vs. History**

* **What sets Solana apart from its competitors is its core innovation, Proof of History**
* To understand Proof of History and why it’s different, we first need to go over the method Bitcoin made famous which is proof of work and this is what Ethereum currently uses as well (explaining this for the beginners on the sub)
   * For **proof of work**, when person A sends a transaction to person B through a blockchain, there are 1000s of computers also known as miners that work to confirm the transaction by solving tiny math problems and once a number of computers agree that a transaction is correct, then the transaction goes through, a block is produced, and the computers are rewarded with tokens like Bitcoin or Ethereum
      * **This basically is the essence of the buzzword decentralization** you hear so often because instead of one centralized system like the US Treasury that mints money, a crowd of people are earning money in the form of tokens through computers
      * There are large mining farms across the world that have thousands of computers making computations to earn tokens through Proof of Work and this has caused many to worry about all the electricity consumption cryptocurrency mining is resulting in
      * **But the bigger problem with proof of work is that it’s much too slow** with Bitcoin and Ethereum both struggling to scale beyond 15 transactions per second and **in addition to that, average fees per transaction currently (as of 5/19/21) sit at** [$13 for bitcoin](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-transactionfees.html#3m) **and** [$21 for Ethereum](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/ethereum-transactionfees.html#3m) which is just way too high
   * In interviews, Anatoly states that he views Bitcoin and Ethereum more as revolutionary proof of concept products rather than platforms structured to serve worldwide audiences (debatable point of view ofc)
      * **Bitcoin** proved that cryptography could be used to create currencies while **Ethereum** proved that blockchain technology could be used for smart contracts BUT **neither were built with the knowledge of how massive crypto would get and how transaction fees would skyrocket**
* The next development to improve upon Proof of Work is called **Proof of Stake**, which is something Ethereum is trying to migrate to but there have been many delays
   * **In proof of work,** the miners who are willing to spend more on energy consumption are selected to confirm the transactions on the blockchain
   * **In proof of stake,** miners are called validators and validators are chosen based on the amount of money they lock away or how much they have ""staked"" and the more validators have staked, the more likely they will be chosen to confirm transactions and thus earn tokens
      * If a bad actor tries to attack the network or do something sketchy, the tokens he/she has ""staked"" will be taken away (this is known as slashing) and provides a layer of protection against bad actors
      * **PoS completely gets rid of the need to consume massive amounts of energy** and is a much more sophisticated approach that many cryptocurrencies have migrated to
* This is where Solana's **Proof of History** comes in
   * Solana still uses proof of stake as its method of verifying blocks, but Anatoly pushed it forward by creating a consensus mechanism called Proof of History and this is at the core is what makes Solana unique
   * **The trouble with decentralized systems is that you have thousands of computers working together to verify transactions but they each use their own clocks and don’t have a common notion of time**
      * As a result, most blockchain infrastructures require validators to talk to each other to agree on the time before verifying transactions and producing the next block
      * **This results in notable delays in the network and is the reason Bitcoin produces blocks only every 10 minutes and Ethereum every 15 seconds**
      * Here's an analogy: imagine that there is an army of 1000 soldiers who in this analogy represent each validator. Each soldier has his own watch and so the time to each soldier is what he believes the time to be, but the actual time may be off by a few seconds or minutes
      * This means that if a general wants the solders to execute an order at a very specific time, he needs to get all the soldiers to agree on the time before that order is fulfilled correctly which is basically what is happening in current blockchain infrastructures
   * **With Proof of History, all computers on the network agree on a universal time through what’s called a SHA-256, sequential-hashing verifiable delay function**
      * **Proof of history results in 0 delays in the network and no waiting around for other validators to agree on the time**
      * **As a result, while most of the latest proof of stake blockchains have blocktimes of a few seconds, Solana is able to achieve blocktimes of 0.4 seconds, and this is why Proof of History is a giant leap forward**

**Why Solana is a Gamechanger (**[reference this chart for this section](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E0OrBZkVEAQ8HJK?format=jpg&name=medium)**)**

* The primary reason is **Solana’s ability to scale**
   * Solana can currently achieve **blocktimes of 0.4 seconds** and **65,000 transactions per second** which makes **Solana one of the fastest blockchain infrastructures in the world**
   * What’s more is that as internet bandwidth and CPU and GPU improve, **block times can reduce and transactions per second can increase theoretically scale to infinity** with a 1gb network supporting about 700,000 TPS and a 10 gb network being able to support 7 million TPS
      * To be fair, this is true for most other crypto platforms as well
   * In comparison, **Visa requires 65,000 transactions per second**, and the **NASDAQ exchange requires 500,000, so Solana can support databases at any scale**
      * This is an extremely important development because applications as large as Facebook or exchanges like the NASDAQ can eventually be built on the Solana platform without performance issues and without enormous fees
* Solana’s capabilities are also better understood when compared against the competition
   * **Solana currently supports the highest transactions per second for a crypto with a working product** (this is from my knowledge, please correct me if I'm mistaken)
      * Though Ethereum 2.0 can scale to 100K transactions per second, the upgrade has yet to come
      * Cardano's hydra solution can scale to 1MM per second, but has no mainnet (launching in August 2021)
   * But more importantly, **Solana is miles ahead in block time versus the rest of the field due to proof of history and block times will also come down with time as well** with Anatoly on the record saying he envisions messages across Solana traveling at the speed of light
   * In addition, **Solana also offers extremely low transaction costs at $0.00001 meaning that 1 million transactions would only cost $10 and Solana also has more validators than the rest** of the field besides Avalanche ([chart reference](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E0OrBZkVEAQ8HJK?format=jpg&name=medium))
   * Github stars is a bit of a vanity metric and are similar to Facebook likes but basically even though Solana has only been around for a few years, it has a **pretty high number of Github stars which slightly demonstrates the interest developers have in the project** ([chart reference](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E0OrBZkVEAQ8HJK?format=jpg&name=medium))
   * And lastly **Solana is a complete layer 1 solution** meaning that everything is built on the Solana blockchain vs. Ethereum 2.0 and Polkadot which are two of Solana’s biggest competitors which utilize sharding ([chart reference](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E0OrBZkVEAQ8HJK?format=jpg&name=medium))
      * Sharding isn't a dealbreaker based on my research and I'm an ETH holder just to be clear but I do think having everything on a Layer 1 solution is cleaner
* All of this is why **Sam Bankman Fried, a prominent figure in the crypto community and founder of the exchange FTX, chose to operate Serum on Solana after a year of testing out different options**
   * In case you’re unfamiliar with it, FTX has been growing rapidly over the past 12 months and as a fun fact, the exchange recently paid for the rights to call the Miami Heat Arena FTX Arena

**Why I Believe Solana Can 3X-5X**

* The logic behind this is very simple and relates to **relative valuation** and this also is based on the assumption that the crypto market continues its bull run
   * Personally, I think we're in the mid to late stages of a crypto bubble, so what I've written below will not come true if the market collapses
* **As of 5/18/21, Solana's Market Cap = $14.6BN, Polkadot = $36.4BN, Cardano = $64.5BN**
   * I think Solana's tech makes it a pretty **undervalued cryptocurrency** just compared to other projects currently on the market
      * I'm not trying to ding other cryptos or say that other projects are bad, just saying I think Solana should be worth more than it is today based on these market caps
   * Why is this? I'm not sure, and perhaps it's because it's a relatively new project (founded in 2018) vs. the other ones so not as many investors are aware
      * **It's also possible I may have missed something, so please let me know if there is reason to doubt Solana or if other projects are just far superior**
   * Anyhow, all this is why if I had to choose one coin the top 15 right now, I would bet on Solana, and I am personally invested in it right now (for full disclosure)

**TLDR**:  Solana is one of the most performant blockchains in the crypto space, using an innovative technology called Proof of History to solve the scalability problem currently faced by earlier technologies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum 1.0. Solana has the potential to 3X-5X, considering that it has superior technology compared to many competitors that have much higher market caps and much fewer actual projects in their ecosystems.",positive,0.87147576,38

415,2021-05-04,"Privacy on BSC?A blockchain is by definition a public ledger. All transactions are publicly registered and are visible to everyone. This makes it possible to derive the relationship between 2 wallets and to create a profile of a person based on their online behaviour. Even worse, since crypto exchanges require KYC, a simple database leak can help hackers or institutions connect your personal information to previous transactions. With that knowledge, I notice that it is increasingly important to me to protect my privacy.

Various privacy solutions have been launched, such as Monero and ZCash, but those projects have their own chains and there is no way for them to cover privacy on other blockchains as well. Now that I use Binance Smart Chain more and more, I started looking for a privacy solution for BSC. In my search , I came across two interesting projects: Swirl Cash (SWIRL) and Typhoon Network (TYPH).

It appears that these two projects are competing to be the go-to solution for privacy on BSC. Swirl is a fork of the proven successful Tornado.cash and was the first to bring privacy protection to BSC, but things seem to be a bit quiet around that project. Typhoon Network seems to be more active with a growing community and is on the verge of being listed on various exchanges which gives me the idea this is a more promising project. Another big difference is the fee. Where Swirl asks a fee of 1%, it is only 0.1% with Typhoon Network. 

Is it better to stick with the project which was first to the scene (SWIRL), or do the benefits of the fast-follower (TYPH) outweigh the risks of using a newer network? Which is easier to use? Is one network more reliable? Does anyone have experience with their customer support? Looking for answers to these questions before I commit.

Tl;dr I need my privacy on BSC and wonder which project, Swirl Cash or Typhoon Network, is better in comparison.

416,2021-05-02,"Coin of the Week (Solid Fundamentals; Solid Project)Hello All, I know recently Reddit has been filled with constant sh/t coins and fake projects aimed at stealing your BNB. Fear not, I have taken it upon myself to present a new coin every week. These coins I list will be a legit project, under 50m market cap, and be listed on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. Further, I will try my upmost hardest to ensure that each coin has a safe platform, doxxed devs, exchanges, and huge potential for growth. Even though I take great time and care for each project I research, please, DYOR. 

To start things off, this weeks top Low Cap Gem is going to be: SYLO. 

For those who do not know, SYLO is an incredible tool that just has not exploded yet. The team is doxxed, there is a long and detailed roadmap (which is listed below), and big exchange platforms. 

**What Does SYLO Offer?**


The Sylo Network is a decentralised communication and storage network with the performance and scalability to support millions of users. Applications use the network for decentralised, private communication, storage, and micro-payments.

Instead of centralised cloud server infrastructure, Sylo users create the decentralised Sylo Network together by running Sylo Node software on their own computers. By running a Sylo Node, users earn Sylo Token in exchange for their device automatically providing critical services to the network (Set to release this month. 

Further, SYLO has its own app in both Google pay store and the Apple App Store in which users can Send money, Stake (coming this month), and use their scanner to find real life items in store. This app has come a long way and has massive potential. 

**SYLO describes their wallet as “Digital wallet meets private messenger”.** 

What do I think? 

Well keep in mind, I am not your advisor, this is just Reddit. However, I think that this project could be massive. It has a rather large competitor being Status; but status has its own issues that SYLO has already solved. Even if Sylo were to reach half of status, it would be a 10-11x increase from where it is now. I except SYLO to be a 500m MC token within 1-2 years. Why 500m? Three reasons: Decentralized Storage, Encrypted Messaging, and Easy Crypto Transactions.

7. 10% of all commissions are credited to development fund 
8. General Tokenomics

   b. No Minting. Masternodes rewarded with transaction fees

9. ATH $0.005141 (10-4-21) ATL $0.00000578 (11-1-21) 
10. Cycle Data Unclear, project is too young 
11. Currently outperforming BTC by a large margin. To be expected with a very young project.

12. IOTA Mcap 5.6B. NANO Mcap 1.4B GBYTE Mcap 64M 
   a. 50x from here would put UBX at 3.2B easily amongst the competition 
   b. 16x from here to get to 1B c. Large growth potential from here for sure. 
   d. Potential for even further growth if can manage to compete with DOT (34B Mcap)

13. Listed on KuCoin, Hotbit, ExMarkets. Over 95% of volume on Kucoin. Good daily volume. Liquidity does not appear to be an issue.99,000USD liq last 24hr More listings to come soon. 3 exchanges want to List. Binance reapplication done.

14. 24hr Volume 18-4-21 6.4M (down 55%) 5302 Holders according to Etherscan as of 18-4-21. UBX claim to have 16,284 Non-zero wallets across 6 blockchains. 69.8% held by 3 wallets belonging to exchanges or the UBX network itself. Biggest Whale holds 1.3% of Total supply, valued just under 1M USD.

15. Proof of Stake

Qualitative Data 

1. Open ecosystem designed to integrate decentralised applications into a cohesive whole.The Decenteralised protocol UBIX (DAG, consists of blockchains of various types) has been developed to exchange master data between applications. The Ubikiri super application interface, built on microservices is used to exchange edata between applications via the internal API. For the development of applications the UBIX launchpad platform is used, this launchpad is integrated into the Ubikiri interface. A special approach called fair-ICO (fICO) is used to finance internal projects. The first project was the UBIX exchange. UBIX ($UBX) - A Digital Universe with Endless Possibilities. Ecosystem overview

2. Target market would be the entire crypto space really. 

3. In order to implement the possibility of creating integrated blockchains the following approach was used. 
   a. Users can create their own blockchains(in terms of the platform consiliums),
   b. Each transaction has a special ;ane; that defines which consilium can process it.
   c. When the conditions defined by the consilium rules appear, consilium is activated and transactions accumulated in the mempool related to this consilium are processed.
   d. When the block created by consilium goes to the general deistributed ledger, where the blocks are connected to each other in a merkle tree, forming a DAG. i. Network node can form subsets that implement certain rules, Each group is called a Consilium (in case you were wondering)

4. DAGs are fairly new to the crypto space from what i can tell. UBX has the potential to be special, I see very few reasons why this can't be successful.

5. From what little information i could find online about the team they seem solid and have alot of experience in the crypto space. They were founded and majority based out of the Russian federation (Probably why there is a lack of info) The Co-Founder Max Breus, also co_founded Silent notary. Studied both law and at the institute of physics and technology in Moscow. Aleksey Petrov was the CFO at silantNotary, He also co-founded UBIX, he also has experience in the finance space. Johan Struijk is the CMO of UBX and worked as an advisor at SilentNotary also. He has experience working as a CEO of a decentralised escrow service. He is focused on marketing and branding at UBX. Link to full team Team - ubix.network

6. Info about the exact token distribution is unavailable.

7. Direct link to full roadmap Roadmap - ubix.network

8. Whitepaper outlined in point 1 

9. Active telegram with 16,000+, Active Twitter Also. Also have an active medium. Looks good.

10. Partnered with Acceleration group, Leader in BIM tech and manager of complex construction projects. Together creating a joint blockchain laboratory, by doing so this will introduce blockchain to the international construction industry. Further info here Partnership announcement: UBIX.Network and Acceleration Group | by UBIX.Network | Medium

11. As far as i could tell, no upcoming events. May be more AMA’s. 

12. AMAs available on telegram https://t.me/ubixAMA 

13. No concerns we can see as yet, as project is still in the early stages. 

Everything seems sound at present,
Recap- Very solid looking project with 100x potential long term. Still very early to the party and i don’t have any major concerns apart from lack of initial token distribution data due to UBX being born out of a swap where-by you had to swap $SNTR for $UBX. Hopefully data is available regarding token distribution of $SNTR. Again no major concerns.
My personal verdict is that i will be purchasing a small position in this project as believe it has huge potential and could reach the $1B club.

Managed to source some Info on the Allocation of funds raised by $SNTR token sale

50% Marketing and Promotion 
20% Legal Status, Experts in different legislations, and introduction of legal practise 
20% R&D 
10% Staff and operational costs

This clears up my one red flag which was lack of into regarding token distribution which could have allowed the team to hold a large % and sell at massive profits later. I am confident this is not the case and the distribution of UBX is fair. 

Professional team and professional project.

No reason this cannot go far.",positive,0.841544,37
418,2021-04-06,"User-FriendlySo I've been doing a lot of research lately, as I want to diversify my holdings a bit. Had a discussion with one of my close friends who's into stocks and doesn't understand cryptocurrencies.  


I tried to explain the ins and outs, but he thought it was ""too complicated"" to get started, and kind of dismissed the idea completely.  


I'm sure I'm not the only one who's experienced the same kind of thing. Crypto isn't user-friendly, hence why I thought DIVI could be a good solution to this problem or parts of it at least.  


DIVI offers its users a multi-tiered masternode concept, which is as easy to deploy with a few clicks of a button, (which is pretty cool considering how technical the process is for any other project).  


They plan to make it possible to send FIAT straight into the DIVI wallet from either your bank account or through Paypal. This will make the DIVI functioning a lot like Venmo, which is pretty damn cool. They plan to release credit cards, which you can use for your everyday life, so you can easily access your money anywhere in the world.  


Their roadmap is pretty impressive, so is the community!  


The wallet is among the best ones I've ever tried. Simple, easy, great UI, which is pretty important.

Originally that token was going to distribute 2% to a charity wallet and 2% to locked liquidity automatically. However, due to an error in the code 4% went to locked liquidity instead.

Our Dev found a creative solution so that this project wouldn’t lose it’s purpose: donating to food charities to feed the world. This solution was to create a companion token called Butter. 

The Butter token pre sale starts on Sunday at 3pm PST. 5% of all transactions that use Butter will go 2 charity. For those that have milk, you can stake up to 50% and generate rewards for putting milk into butter. Milk churns butter

To help this growth even more, dev decided to hold a real Porsche giveaway. That's right, one lucky $POWSCHE holder will win Porsche once we hit 10M market cap. And the best part is that you can win even with 1 $POWSCHE in your wallet!

**Let me tell you more about this giveaway.** 

All we know so far is that it will happen once $POWSCHE reaches 10M market cap and also how the winner will be chosen. Every participant gets 1 entry for every token he holds and also for every time his refferral is used or for every time he uses refferral of somebody else. No word yet on which Porsche will be competing but believe me when I say that this is something unique and will definitely push $POWSCHE even above 10M target. 

**But $POWSCHE is not just about this giveaway.** 

The marketing team wants to take an advantage of this growth and start pushing Twitter, Reddit, IG, Tiktok and maybe even some paid advertising as hard as possible. All these efforts along with the FOMO of everyone who sold during the dip will skyrocket us right into a new ATH.

InvestDex is the first-of-its-kind workstation with a special focus on the DeFi Space, essentially making trading easier and more structured. By combining traditional task management software with the most advanced data available on the market, InvestDex’s purpose is to let you visualize, manage, and organize your assets, so traders can gain an edge on the market and strategize their investments in a well-organized manner.

The project launching was postponed with 3 months by the team and instead of raising funds early, they first preferred to develop their product and to start with confidence in this entrepreneurial journey. The project launched on 15th of June on Pancakeswap right after the completion of its triple IDO on TosDis, DuckStarter and BSCPAD. It was sold out in a matter of minutes. It’s important to notice that the amount of funding from VC’s was limited, preferring instead to give an opportunity to the community to enter at the seed sale stage. All early rounds of funding have been heavily vested to protect all of the investors from heavy selling pressure at listing. The contract address (0x853A8Ab1c365ea54719EB13A54d6B22F1fBe7FEb) is audited by SolidGroup and 75% of the liquidity is locked with Unicrypt. The other 25% are reserved for a pool on ETH which will bring Uniswap and cross-chain in a due time.

The next 2 weeks are free of charge using the platform. The payment of subscription fees will only be handled in the native INVEST token by connecting your Metamask wallet. Furthermore, InvestDex introduces a tiered system, where people who hold a predefined amount of INVEST tokens or who provide liquidity will qualify for discounts on monthly subscription fees as well as additional services.

In addition to all of this, InvestDex maintains a deflationary system where 50% of the tokens collected from subscription fees will be burned for the first six months and 15% of these fees will be burned the following year. The users of InvestDex will enjoy the sexiest UI in the space and a lot of advanced features that will help them to stay organized and to increase their wealth. Some of the features are:

* Pair Explorer
* Pool Explorer
* Real time data charts
* Multi Swap
* New listings Explorer
* Whale Watcher
* Workstation (Coming soon)
* Account Scanner
* Portfolio
* Unlimited favorites & Alerts
* Interactive Calendar
* Risk Management Calculator/Analysis
* ETH Vs BTC Comparison
* Telegram Bot Access (Coming soon)
* Integrated Tools (Coming soon)
* Integrated Limit Orders (Coming soon)
* Wallet Tracker (Coming soon)

The Whale Watcher is a feature that allows the users to filter High Volume trades( $10K + ) tracking Whales and their movements..Its very handy tool as you can copy their trades. It can be also filtered by volume of the transactions. Generally the Whales are in the know and this can be a lucrative trading strategy. There is also an implemented feature New Token Listing. It's a dedicated page to show all new token listings on that particular DEX. The next 2 weeks is coming the features Workstation and Interactive Calendar which will help traders and investors stay organized.

Right now, the users can visualize in beautiful charts cryptocurrencies from Uniswap and Pancakeswap. The team is currently working on the implementation of Polygon/MATIC blockchain. Next is going to be SOLANA.

All that in combination with the current Market Cap ($1,1M) should give you an idea about the potential of InvestDex and its token INVEST. The competitors are running behind that beast!

Now hopefully you enjoyed this read and found it informative enough. I’ll link [another DD here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/mqxl33/strike_coin_strike_catalyst/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) if you want someone else’s view on TradeStrike & Strike Coin.

Remember that TradeStrike as a company was born before Strike Coin. Many launch coins first and either incorporate company later (like GMR) or don’t at all. Once TradeStrike is FCA registered, things will really blow up.

In my own opinion I believe that this project has insane potential and has a strong enough community to carry it to where it needs to be. 

If you have any questions please feel free to ask me or anyone in the community and I'm sure we will all be able to help you.

429,2021-05-17,"SPACECORGI [6.5M market cap] [12 days old] [Ownership Renounced] Partnerships with major Pet Service iOS/Android apps |&#x200B;

While we're waiting for BTC/ETH to come back, now is actually a good and risky entrypoint to what I think will be the biggest new dog token in 1-2 months time. Yeah dog tokens can be risky right now but this is a moonshot and SpaceCorgi has actual potential as a 100-1000x coin. Here is why I'm going big on **SpaceCorgi**:

 Major pet partnerships from day 0. They have a major partnership with the [biggest iOS/Android dog waste removal app](https://scoopers.club/2021/05/05/80640/). Scoopers even has an online shop coming that will be completely powered by $SCORGI: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3Ts\_xKTrTE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3Ts_xKTrTE)

With SpaceCorgi's partnership with Scoopers.club, just look at similar projects that once started from zero:

* Chewy: MC = $29.7billion
* Wag: MC = $800 Million
* Rover: MC (estimate) = $1.4billion
* Petco: MC = $6.3billion

Imagine passing on any of these companies in their infancy if you had the chance. Remember that SpaceCorgi has TRUE UTILITY.

 The dev team is incredibly experienced. They had some of the fastest CMC and CG listings I've ever seen and that is with all the congestion that so many shitcoins have caused. One member of their dev team is also recognized on a Forbes list. Their identities aren't public yet but they plan to announce after the first Centralized Exchange Listing

 Honestly, how well the community and dev team have held up in the past few days when BTC and ETH have dropped so much is enough to convince me that SpaceCorgi is a long-term play and here to stay

 I've seen a lot of TikTokers mention SpaceCorgi and honestly that's how I first heard about SafeMoon, so maybe I'm biased but I think that is a good indicator of turbo chad market caps. Dev team says they have a bunch of TikTokers and even celebrity shout-outs scheduled for this week.

 First AMA is this week

Formation! PLEASE READ

Mission - $FORM. A MDAO mission is a fund-raising effort that enables participants to purchase a token in pre-sale. Instead of asking for donations or lotteries, MDAO plans to raise funds via these MDAO missions. Keep in the mind, although the missions create a new token that can be traded on PancakeSwap, the missions are not long-term projects and are high-risk, high-reward. In the future, the missions will serve a greater purpose but these early missions do not.

Mission #2.1 - FORMATION
Hard-cap 80 BNB
Liquidity lock 55% for 2 months
Funds raised will be used for the liquidity event (pumping liquidity directly into MDAO) and further marketing/team expansion
Listing price of the token will be 3x the pre-sale price, offering incentive to those participating

Why participate?
To have fun and gamble on a chance to 3x your investment
To help support MDAO growth

What not to do?
1) Do not sell MDAO to participate, that is counter-productive as the funds being raised will benefit MDAO
2) Do not over invest, and if you've never participated in a pre-sale, proceed with caution
3) Shill a pre-sale to outside investors without welcoming them to our group for further understanding

Each pre-sale will have a disclosure, if a disclosure is not provided, it is not an MDAO mission. All missions will be announced here before launching.

RULES OF ENGAGEMENT

DO NOT BUY THE MISSION IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND ITS PURPOSE

DO NOT SELL YOUR MDAO TO BUY THE MISSION, HODL MDAO, THE MISSION BENEFITS MDAO, CONSIDER BUYING MORE IF YOU HAD SUCCESS

DISCLOSURE: THIS PRE-SALE IS A MARTIAN DAO MISSION, THE INCENTIVE TO INVEST MAY SEEM APPEALING BUT THIS MISSION IS INTENDED TO BE HIGH-RISK, HIGH-REWARD AND IS NOT INTENDED TO BE A LONG-TERM PROJECT. A PORTION OF THE FUNDS RAISED IN THIS MISSION WILL BE INJECTED INTO $MDAO’S LIQUIDITY POOL. PLEASE JOIN US ON TELEGRAM TO LEARN MORE: https://t.me/MartianDAO. INVEST WISELY AND PLAY SAFE, JOIN US IN NEW GALAXIES! WARNING: DO NOT APE IN, READ THE DISCLOSURE AND LEARN MORE.

431,2021-05-01,"$BUTTER TOKEN: ~550K MCAP REAL PROJECT WITH LONG TERM USE CASEHey Guys,

This is a real project with a use case that is in it for the long term. I really can't say that for a lot of other projects in the BSC space right now. The token is about a month old and is still holding up strong with continued development from the team. They are focused on building a strong foundation behind this token.

The lead developer is doxed and the team has been established as a legal entity. 

**There is a LIVE VIDEO AMA this Sunday with the fully doxed team!!! This is the 6th AMA..... yes the team is committed and not going nowhere!**

**The Dev actively communicates with the community and takes time to implement new features into the ecosystem based on community suggestions.**

**Some examples include:**

* Staking system custom coded to Churn Milk into Butter
* Integrated wallet on website to see token balance and monetary value
* Charity voting mechanism that is custom coded and built into the contract to suggest and vote for charities
* Many more to come in the coming weeks including NFT farming for members holding tokens, gamification, and lottery.

**Token Name: $BUTTER**

**Max Supply: 1,000,000,000,000**

**Burned Tokens: 370,874,653**

**Liquidity Locked: On DxSale until 2022, then it will be relocked on UniCrypt**

**Token Specifics:**

* **5% Charity**  
5% of transactions using the Butter token are collected by the Butter Token contract and sold into BNB that is reserved to be collected by the Charity Wallet
* **2% Liquidity**  
The Butter Token contract takes 2% of every contract and locks those tokens into a liquidity pair to ensure it is always tradeable on Pancakeswap
* **2% Staking Rewards**  
Milk Holders who have staked their Milk in the Butter Churn earn 2% of every Butter transaction proportional to their share of the Milk staking pool
* **1% Expenses Fee**  
1% of Butter transactions are sold into BNB and reserved in the contract to be collected by an expenses wallet for use in marketing/promotion/business expenses related to the Milk and Butter tokens

433,2024-06-15,"$HEGE has been reaching for previous ATH and here are some reasons why:Why $HEGE is a long-term hold, and not your usual short-term meme project. Time to rotate those profits into $HEGE!

No I'm not chatgpt or a bot so get that out of your system first, random guy who always comes here. 

Now onto it. $HEGE was born as the anti-rug, the anti-scam, a way to gain trust of those who were rugged before, and as a safe haven for those new to memecoins. Due to that same attitude, we work hard to make sure your money is as safe as it can be, well, in a memecoin space that is. From shrimps to whales.

Because of that, we've made long-term plans to develop this project into something that'll last—not based on a cultural zeitgeist, a fleeting election, a literal photo of an animal—but something new. Every bull market will bring new people and with it—new scammers. $HEGE will be here to help them, to create a community to guide them. $HEGE will be there to make sure your profits from those pump and dumps you got lucky on are safe. Here are things the team and community at $HEGE are doing to make this last:

1. Nobody single person can rug this coin—our liquidity is high, and no one person has enough. We know, our whales have disclosed and once larger CEX listings come, have volunteered to lock a large portion of their $HEGE (I am one of them).

2. Real utility—the $HEGE Academy. While in early stages, the team (current animators, former teachers, and more) are putting together an ""academy"" that will teach newer folks how to identify scams among many other things. As a former teacher, I'll be helping develop the curriculum myself.

3. Roadmaps, marketing debriefs, transparency. Not gonna lie—we had a bumpy time earlier. We were about to start a marketing push when a few unlucky things happened. The team, not wanting to waste the $26k the community raised, stopped the marketing and pivoted strategies. Afterward, they published a marketing debrief, admitting what went wrong and how they were going to fix it. As you can see, it worked. We're up 300% since then! This dedication will continue and as we speak, roadmap #2 is being worked on.

4. CEX listings. We are starting small with TooBit, so that we can dip our feet in as a small MC (7.3m now). We have a plan to continue listing on larger CEXs as MC increases, as it seems logical. These listings will increase the base and give more stable volume as time goes on. A blue chip of memes, if you will.

5. Just, the community itself. You've seen us on Reddit. We're relentless, even when times are tough. We don't give up on our investments or your investments. Go on dexscreener and see how many coins have absolutely zero plan—even big MCs. It's why you'll see them fade over a very quick time or a slow death. Because they rode a wave and didn't actually care about the coin's development. We aren't that. We have been through a movie-worth of struggles. We don't give up. 


TLDR; buy $HEGE, rotate profits, and get your next 50x because this is a safe investment—well, for a memecoin.  Find our TG and other socials at hegecoin.com, see our X, and you'll understand the quality we offer.

The game features an in-game corporation system, allowing players to own shares and manage businesses. It also combines RPG and shooter elements with a new skill-based reward structure.

A recent beta test attracted over 3,000 users who played for over 11,000 hours. The next play-to-mint event is scheduled for July.

1. Validate the authenticity of every ticket and verify the owner (especially for private and VIP events where a ticket should be linked to the specific guest). 
2. Create art-like tickets representing the event's story and brand that people would love to collect.
3. Access powerful data to make subsequent events better.
4. Include special perks and engage with the community, give additional incentives to those frequently attending events.
5. Pre-sell drinks, food, and other packages to minimise the waiting line.
6. Send outstanding event invites to VIP guests and members.

This list will continue to grow as NFT technology enables simpler and edgy ways to interact with event guests and sponsors.

**It also opens new opportunities for guests:**

1. Store art-like tickets safely to keep all memories close.
2. Engage and feel a part of favourite event organizers' communities 
3. Receive special perks and incentives from organizers.
4. Sell valuable and rare past event tickets that other people would love to collect.
5. Easily sell tickets for upcoming events that you suddenly can't go to.

Large festivals can now issue tickets in collaboration with digital artists to bring a greater value to their guests and community.

Sport organizers also benefit from the new way of ticketing. Imagine your favourite football club issuing a ticket with some memorable moment from the game or maybe featuring a famous player. Such tickets become collectable with extra value and are now available to fans everywhere even if they couldn't attend the game themselves.

NFTs can also make invitations for family events special. Imagine turning your 5-year-old's drawing into an NFT invitation for her birthday party. Marvellous, isn't it?

The market is definitely awaiting some interesting changes with art-like tickets being a part of them.

441,2021-05-24,"Komodo to help VISA launch decentralized exchangeOk. Listen up. This is not your average meme coin post where I tell you to buy into X Ponzi scheme because I saw a fractal in my morning coffee. In this post, I want to tell you about recent development that will forever change the crypto space as we currently know it.

Visa crypto payments solution Gleec has launched a decentralized trading exchange called GleecDEX in partnership with Komodo. Gleec will utilize Komodo’s p2p atomic swap technology, AtomicDEX.

This is HUGE for Komodo and the crypto space. If you have been here long enough, or you have a crypto savvy friend, you probably know that Komodo’s tech is unparalleled. But let’s talk first about the title of this post.

During its first-quarter earnings call, Visa announced that their strategy is to work with wallets and exchanges to enable users to purchase or to cash out crypto into fiat using their Visa credentials. Imagine a company that already supports 190 billion transactions per year, not just opening into the crypto space, but also launching a decentralized exchange now. And as you can expect KMD will have a central role here, allowing you to use KMD to pay less fees. 

Crypto itself cannot democratize the financial world if we keep using centralized and rigged exchanges. If an exchange gets hacked and is forced into bankruptcy, all the users who held funds on that exchange have no recourse. Their funds are gone forever and there is no way to recoup their losses. Does Mt.Gox hack sound familiar? In AtomicDEX, you never need to deposit anything into the exchange, you trade directly from your wallet. Your keys. Your funds.

And security is not the only thing here. Have you ever tried to log into your Binance/Coinbase account during periods of huge volatily to just find out their servers are down, and that  by the time you can log back in, your orders did not execute and now you are rekt? This happened again just 6 days ago when BTC tanked 30%. Nothing new under the sun. It is widely known that big exchanges favour large customers. They lock retail out during periods of huge volatily, and by doing this, big players can scoop the dip before anyone else. AtomicDeX ensures 100% uptime because it is a full peer-to-peer decentralized exchange. Funds can't be frozen and orders can't be stopped.

And this just does not stop here... Komodo's technology is so fucking ahead in security and scalability that just blows my socks off. Komodo features 'Delayed Proof of Work (dPoW)', which in simple words is like recycling mining activity. What!?? Yes. Listen up. By notarizing to a chain with a very high hash rate, Komodo ""recycles"" the mining output to secure $kmd and other smartchains

Komodo also provides this to other chains. This helps prevent 51% attacks for smaller PoW / PoS chains who don't yet have a mature enough network to guarantee their own security.

NO OTHER PROJECT DOES THIS

Although the coin is a meme coin, it is not a joke. It has dedicated developers and it is being distributed freely over multiple faucets. Primary one being [https://bananominer.com/](https://bananominer.com/) where one can contribute to medical research using Folding@Home and earn Banano while doing that. I really love that and that is what sold me immediately. That and the fact that it does not waste computing resources.

Banano is not listed on any of the big exchanges right now, so it has an excellent cozy feeling that I really love.

It is by no means something that will 100x your investment, but it is a great coin to get new people into crypto. It definitely deserves more attention. It is a hard fork of Nano, but it is very likely that any improvements that are made into Nano will be rolled into Banano as well over time.

444,2024-10-05,"Kendu - Lets Talk About the FUDActually, let's let the auditors do it for us. Anybody who has been interested by all the claims of positive metrics around Kendu but worried about the FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt) you come across calling it a scam, avoid the reddit comment section and just check out what auditors say about it. Links are all below.

To be clear, scams coins aren't around for as long as we have been, much less are they as active.  

Not sure if you can trust the audit links? Fine, then check whatever coin you deem reliable on that platform, and see what it spits back at you. 

With Kendu, everything but trading volume is up at the moment. Everything. When most whales sold, people bought the dip, pumping both the holder count and the coin. That's redistribution. That's healthy for any coin. The concerns with other AltCoins and memes like Shib are that whales control and manipulate the market. Whales do do that. That's not a problem with Kendu anymore (check the Etherscan link below). 

Now, I know trading volume is important. But, Kendu doesn't pay for growth, it grows organically. What's that mean? Well, think about what happened with GameStop stock on WSB a few years ago. A group got together to upheave and redefine the space by not playing by the rules. They hyped and pumped it up themselves. By refusing to ride the waves caused by whales. That's Kendu within crypto.  

Kendu does not pay for KOLs (Key Opinion Leader). What's a KOL? Those are the X and YouTube influencers pumping up some bs coin with an obnoxious name and even more ridiculous logo and slogan. Coins that stand for nothing, offer you nothing, and are built on a house of cards. When the dev (developer) and whales within those coins feel like they've scammed enough people in to buying in, they dump/rug pull. Or, when the KOL scams the Dev in to giving them a huge number of tokens for a post or a video, the KOL sells out to cash in, dumping the coin. That's what happens. 

We don't do that at Kendu. Why? Because we don't gamble, we work.

Also, IF we have any extra cash, we'd rather buy more Kendu with it, and spread by word of mouth/social media posts. Buying in to KOLs or bots is either a waste of money or a death sentence for your coin. 

To be clear, the memecoin space isn't for everyone. It's the wild west of the internet, of Crypto, and of DeFI. You need to have thick skin, diamond hands and balls of steel to survive here. It's volatile here and can't always be tracked with the same metrics used to game traditional markets. There's also A LOT of money to be made in this space by those with conviction .. and it's usually made off of the backs of those who sell at a loss. We call the latter Daniels at Kendu in memory of the guy who dropped his bags at 4M MC right before the ATH. 

Back to metrics, trading volume is a catch 22 though - if more people are holding (which holder count has never seen a negative week) then less people are trading. Growth is still outpacing selling, but it's organic. Organic is slow. Holders are shilling constantly (no, we're not bots) and shilling IRL (In Real Life). They're filming themselves, getting tattoos, and going viral. Kendu was trending number 1 on X just a few weeks back. 

All of this, and Kendu is only 7 months old. All the fudders like to point out how low Kendu is from ATH, but ignore the fact that Kendu reached ATH \~4 months in to launch, all organically. The growth was as slow before that until it wasn't, with a massive spike in engagement causing a launch to ATH within a 2 month window in early summer. However, when the crypto market drew back, Kendu moved with the market. We've been working diligently to regain that visibility since.  

Yes, Kendu released an NFT (Non Fungible Token) marketplace called Chads. Not interested in NFTs? That's fine. It is still worth noting that it resulted in the largest NFT mint of the last three years with 10K chads minted in \~2 months generating millions in IRL money that went right back in to Kendu. You'll notice I said marketplace and not just NFTs. While the Chads marketplace doesn't expect to overtake OpenSeas (valued at $13.3 billion currently), it's goal is to take conquer some of that space. Think of a tier 2 CEX (Coin Exchange) as compared to a Tier 1 like CoinBase. Also, anybody who bought one or some of the initial 10k Chad NFTs bought into ownership of the marketplace, generating income on fees collected from trading within the Chads Marketplace. 

Was Kendu scammed? No. Well, sort of. Somebody hacked in to the BitGet Telegram account and posed as a BitGet rep to collect $100K from Kendu in exchange for a listing. However, when BitGet got wind of this, not only did the CEO come in to a Live X Spaces with the community, but BitGet will be buying in to Kendu to the tune of $100k USD. Recently, a Robinhood funded account also bought $112k USD of Kendu. Finally, a few months ago CoinBase released an ad that featured Kendu front and center among several other top tier meme coins, stable coins, alt coins, and BTC. Kendu is the only meme coin shown in that ad that isn't actually listed on CoinBase .. yet. There may or may not be a conversation in the works. 

Weirdly enough, somebody also hacked in to the official United Nations X account and tried to get money from the dev. He said he'd pay if they'd post from official account, and so there's several screen shots somewhere of an official United Nations X account posting that Kendu is Lord. To be clear, Dev knew it was another hack, and it got reported shortly after.  

Look, I'm not trying to convince you to buy in. But, in the entire 7 month life span of Kendu (yes, that's all), we've made a lot of waves. Think back to all the other coins you've seen pumped and gone in that time (can you even name 3). All the other older meme coins you wished you would moon but seemed manipulated but whales. 

That's not us. Never has been. Never will be. We're too distributed. We're the little guys fighting our way to the top. Call us degenerates, a cult, unhinged. A band of cucks and a crew of jeets. We're invested in memecoins, we obviously love the pain. Just don't call us a fucking scam and DYOR instead.

At Kendu Inu, we don't gamble. We fuckin work. 

If another meme coin looks more attractive right now and is pumping, buy in. Just remember, you might be buying at their top. Right now, with a coin that's gained this much notoriety, you know that Kendu has not only found it's floor, but tested to make sure it's solid enough to launch from. 

So buy in or don't and happy bull run to all.

AI can analyze vast amounts of data to understand customer behavior and personalize marketing campaigns. AI can also automate tasks like content creation and ad placement. This can save marketers time and money while improving campaign performance.



Cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology could further revolutionize this by enabling more secure and transparent data sharing and ad transactions, while also empowering consumers with greater control over their own data. A good example of this mix of crypto and AI is AdEx.

It seems like a really good multi-purpose chain that focuses on scalability but low transaction fees seem to be a priority as well. With the gaming sector constantly growing and the RWA sector slowly moving assets on-chain, I think there will be a lot of demand for such blockchains.


What do you guys think about their usecases and tokenomics. For me personally, they seem well thought out since there are both deflationary and inflationary mechanisms at play, but that is just one of many aspects that seem different and innovative.

Literally every buy, sell, or transfer burns coin. The larger the burn wallet grows, means more coins being burnt per transaction.

Today they hit their 4th holder count milestone. 100T coin will be burnt, thats 10% of the total supply. This is the 4th burn, over 30% or 300T coin will have been burnt after today meaning the burn wallet will now receive that much more in reflection, effectively burning more and more each time.

This project and group of devs are amazing. Not only are they one of the most hyper deflationary coins on the market, they're offering partial ownership in their NFT marketplace, [Zunaverse.io](https://zunaverse.io/) You'll really want to check out the ZunaNaut collection as they have potential to be life changing.

456,2021-06-13,"$Milk and $Butter token are going to be featured in an upcoming indie film!Last week Butter Token, a revolutionary new charity token on the Binance network raised over $16,406 for Binance Charity, Action Against Hunger, and Food For Life Global. This has the most recipients of a $Butter donation to date proving that Milk and Butter are here to stay and make a difference despite any market fluctuations. https://ffl.org/user/milktoken/

Action Against Hunger is the latest of Milk and Butter’s historic partnerships. In total, the token has raised over $455,000 since it’s launch on 4/4/21. The token works by utilizing a fee on every transaction. A portion of that fee is sent to the “Charity Wallet” where investors can then vote on which charity receives the funds. A percentage of every donation goes to Butter Token’s partners Food for Life Global and Action Against Hunger. The remainder of the funds are donated to the winning charity. Binance charity received $8,818, Food For Life Global received $5,722 and Action Against Hunger received $1,866.

CEO of Food For Life Global Paul Turner says, “Happy to report that the Milk and Butter community of investors have now fed 442,968 children in need via Food for Life Global.” The diversity in donations allows for different care and treatment for those in need. The donations to Action Against Hunger will focus on helping children facing malnutrition. The money donated covers the cost of transportation, customs, medical fees, food, etc. “There is potentially 250 people who are here today because of you all so I just wanted to say thank you,” says Aron Flasher, Managing Director of Corporate Partnerships for Action Against Hunger.

Christian Claypool, CEO of Milk and Butter LLC, says, “With every donation we make, we're continuing to provide for those in need and generate a positive social output using our product and platform.“

We have our live video [AMA](https://www.twitch.tv/milkbuttertoken) tonight!

Our last donation of nearly $70k went to helping feed those in need. $34,772 went to “Action Against Hunger” and $34,336 went to “Food For Life Global”. Our donation to [FFLG](https://twitter.com/fflglobal/status/1396473562249236481?s=21) fed 137,344 children during a market dip, which continues to grow! While the value of crypto may be lower in this bearish market, the values of Milk and Butter LLC remain high!

News from this week:

• Over 40k $Milk holders and 7k $Butter holders

•Our tokens will be featured in an upcoming Indie film! Find a sneak peek here: https://twitter.com/milk_token/status/1403789126961299456?s=21

• We donated over 16k to Binance Charity, Food For Life Global, and Action Against Hunger 

• Currently in the process of forming a relationship with an independent marketing firm to assist us in the marketing of the Milk and Butter tokens.

• Working with a brand specialist for a yet to be announced product.

Milk and Butter tokens, for those that haven’t heard, are companion tokens in the Binance Smart Chain with an emphasis on charity giving. Milk is an RFI token that can be staked to generate Butter, which is used to power community voting for their favorite charities on a weekly basis. Those that merely wish to vote may purchase Butter tokens on the open market as well, which also drives rewards for those that stake Milk! 
https://www.milktoken.net/voting.html

5% of all Butter transactions are guaranteed to go to a charity wallet. In addition, Butter can be used to suggest new charities.
https://www.milktoken.net/suggest.html

$455k has been donated to charity so far, at a very low market cap. We made crypto history when Butter became the first BEP-20 token to partner with a major food charity: Food For Life Global  https://ffl.org/20077/cryptocurrency-butter-token/

The liquidity for both the Milk and Butter tokens is locked away until 2022, at which point both will be relocked. Our Market cap is still low with a solid base, we're building our community for healthy growth, and we’ll continue to develop this project with many exciting use cases plus a full array of features to be rolled out as development completes.

Each week the Milk and Butter token team hosts AMAs with the Developer on Twitch where the community can ask any questions they may have. Occasionally, we have guests, such as when the CEO of “Food For Life Global” joined us and explained the amazing genesis of “Food for Life Global” and took viewer questions. Our AMA’s stream every Sunday at 3am UTC [here.](https://www.twitch.tv/milkbuttertoken)

462,2021-03-26,"$UNIT, is it worthy of your money?Not Financial Advice, etc., you know the drill.

I've seen this posted multiple times and replied to the posts because I've been in it almost since launch. I will say its pros and cons as I've been here since the start.

The pros: The website looks very professional which it's getting rarer in this pump and dump land. The Devs are constantly in the groups, very responsive and making marketing campaigns so more people know and want to invest into the token. They instantly burnt the LP after creating it and took the simple step of verifying the contract, so we can take a look at the launch.

One thing that is quite neat of this token is the liquidity and redistribution system. Every time someone makes a transaction, 2% of the total amount is locked into liquidity diluting the selling price impact and reinforcing the price floor.

Also, they will be adding NFTs and mining, I don't really know how but I'm here for the long run so we'll see if they make good on their promises.

The cons is that it's another token with safe tokenomics and doesn't have a use case at the moment, you just hold it waiting for the price to rise.

The team wants to stay anon, but I don't think that's good nor bad, this is crypto, none of you guys wants to be doxxed.

So, to finish this up. Why should we give them our money?

Well, it's up to you really. I gave you my thoughts and will leave some info down below. I'm staying because I took a liking to the team and the token aesthetics.

The token, which went live on eight centralized exchanges, is built on the Base blockchain and plays a key role in CARV’s ecosystem, including CARV Protocol, CARV Play, and CARV Labs. $CARV offers governance rights, node ownership, high-yield staking, and a buyback program, promoting decentralization and data monetization. It also supports CARV’s play-to-earn economy and Web2 companies' access to user-controlled data.


With a total supply of 1 billion tokens, $CARV is distributed among community members, the founding team, advisors, and investors. CARV's tokenomics includes veCARV, a locked version to enhance governance through long-term staking. In 2024, CARV aims to generate $43 million in revenue, release its mainnet, and implement enhanced privacy and decentralized sequencers. The token’s broad utility positions it for future growth in gaming, data monetization, and Web2 integration.

Here is a quick breakdown:


* Market potential: DEXs are gaining traction due to security concerns with centralized exchanges (CEXs). The perpetuals market, where ApeX Pro focuses, is also on the rise.


* Competition: ApeX Pro is a competitor to dYdX, another DEX leader. However, ApeX Pro has a lower market cap and has grown faster in the last year.


* Tokenomics: Similar to dYdX, APEX has a limited supply and offers staking rewards. ApeX is taking steps to manage an upcoming token unlock to avoid price drops.

Massive marketing push incoming!The Collective is developing BSC's first decentralized freelancer marketplace. Similar to fiverr or etsy, but powered by crypto.The Collective is the future home of one of the first crypto decentralized freelance marketplaces bringing together artists, developers, marketers, and other providers of various products and services, while providing their prospective clients a safe and secure means to do business.

The Collective Coin is a community driven Defi coin and will be the official currency of The Collective. The coin will be the main currency on the marketplace.

Main features:

COMMUNITY-DRIVEN

We strive to maintain a strong community that supports and represents what The Collective stands for. At launch, there will be five separate developer wallets that will each hold 1%, for a total of 5% of the total supply. These wallets will help fund the development of the Collective Marketplace. The developers of The Collective will then participate with the public in purchasing of additional coins.

trendingBURN SYSTEM

After every trade occurs 5% of the transaction will be burned forever into a burn wallet that is locked away. This will decrease the total supply and increase the value of the coin.

AUTOMATIC LIQUiDITY POOL

After every trade occurs 5% contributes towards automatically generating liquidity that goes into multiple pools used by exchanges.

THE MARKETPLACE

Currently offering graphic design services in exchange for cryptocurrencies, the goal of The Collective is to create a decentralized marketplace, inspired by platforms such as Etsy and Fiverr, for other providers to also offer their products and services to clients in exchange for The Collective Coin, or virtually any established cryptocurrency of their choosing, for a small fee.

Providers will create a profile, and have the ability to establish a virtual storefront on the Marketplace, which will be accessible through a dApp from the user’s wallet.

Tokenomics:

Total Supply: 500,000,000,000,000 (500 Trillion) Supply after 50% Burn: 250,000,000,000,000 (250 Trillion) Private Community ICO: 8.4% (21.5 Trillion) 375B/BNB - 73 Wallets Dev Wallets: 5% (12.5 Trillion) 2.5 Trillion/per wallet - 5 Wallets Unicrypt Presale: 27% (135 Trillion) 300B/BNB Liquidity Locked One Year, locked for 3 more years: 79 Trillion

469,2021-04-29,"$BUTTER TOKEN: ~500K MCAP REAL PROJECT WITH LONG TERM USE CASEHey Guys,

I'll be straight to the point with this and speak my honest thoughts. This is a real project with a use case that is in it for the long term. I really can't say that for a lot of other projects in the BSC space right now. The token is about a month old and is still holding up strong with continued development from the team. They are focused on building a strong foundation behind this token.

The lead developer is doxed and the team has been established as a legal entity. Once the paperwork is complete, the rest of team will be doxed soon.

**The Dev actively communicates with the community and takes time to implement new features into the ecosystem based on community suggestions.**

**Some examples include:**

* Staking system custom coded to Churn Milk into Butter
* Integrated wallet on website to see token balance and monetary value
* Charity voting mechanism that is custom coded and built into the contract to suggest and vote for charities
* Many more to come in the coming weeks including NFT farming for members holding tokens, gamification, and lottery.

**Token Name: $BUTTER**

**Max Supply: 1,000,000,000,000**

**Burned Tokens: 370,874,653**

**Liquidity Locked: On DxSale until 2022, then it will be relocked on UniCrypt**

**Token Specifics:**

* **5% Charity**  
5% of transactions using the Butter token are collected by the Butter Token contract and sold into BNB that is reserved to be collected by the Charity Wallet
* **2% Liquidity**  
The Butter Token contract takes 2% of every contract and locks those tokens into a liquidity pair to ensure it is always tradeable on Pancakeswap
* **2% Staking Rewards**  
Milk Holders who have staked their Milk in the Butter Churn earn 2% of every Butter transaction proportional to their share of the Milk staking pool
* **1% Expenses Fee**  
1% of Butter transactions are sold into BNB and reserved in the contract to be collected by an expenses wallet for use in marketing/promotion/business expenses related to the Milk and Butter tokens

Here’s why I’m bullish on Kendu:

1. Community-Driven Powerhouse: Kendu Inu isn’t just another random meme coin. The Kendu Chads community is growing fast, and they are serious about taking $KENDU to the next level. This isn't just hype—it's a strong, united group of holders committed to driving the project forward. Just check out the Kendu Inu Twitter page to see some of the wild things the community is doing.

2. Active and Transparent Dev Team: The devs behind Kendu Inu are incredibly active on social media and within the community, constantly working on new updates and improvements. Transparency is rare in crypto these days, but these guys are doing it right!

3. Potential for Explosive Growth: We’ve all seen what happened with DOGE and SHIB. When a meme coin gains a strong community and some actual utility, it can go parabolic. Kendu Inu is just getting started, and there’s a lot of room for growth.

TL;DR: If you’re sleeping on $KENDU, now might be the time to wake up. The potential is real, and I’m personally loading up while it’s still under the radar. DYOR as always, but Kendu Inu could be the next big thing! 

Let’s go, Kendu Chads

474,2024-08-13,"Exponential Explains the Downgrading of Angle USDAExponential, an investment platform for crypto holders, recently downgraded its DAI rating and did the same for USDA. Here is the rationale:


>The downgrade follows Exponential’s reassessment of Angle’s collateral backing. Currently, about $17 million or over 50% of USDA’s collateral backing is deposited in Morpho Blue, an immutable money market with isolated lending pools. As the protocol launched only in January this year, Morpho is less battle-tested, adding to the potential risks. This introduces a single point of failure; if Morpho were to be hacked or otherwise compromised, a substantial portion of USDA’s backing could be jeopardized.


What are your thoughts on this and will this affect USDA or Angle in any way?

479,2021-10-23,"Altcoin Mythbusting: Do Alts Pump after big $BTC moves?**Tl;DR: For the BTC pumps I looked at, Altcoins bleed during but typically pump to higher highs afterwards. I'm using this knowledge to diversify my portfolio with** [some smaller-cap, high-potential](https://cryptopragmatist.com/sign-up/) **alts.**

\-

>**""Alt season is coming.""**

Or, at least, that’s what the internet says. After parabolic moves by Bitcoin, common wisdom tells us altcoins pump shortly after.

On the heels of this latest Bitcoin all-time-high, will it happen again? We can never be sure, but we can use data from the past to better inform our investing decisions.

# 

# The Data

Today, we’ll be looking at four time periods where Bitcoin pumped, then seeing if altcoins followed along in its path. This is admittedly not a lot of data-you could even argue its merely anecdotal. But if we see that altcoins performed well every time, well, it’s probably enough to reallocate some capital to an alt portfolio make sure we’re well exposed, just in case.

To analyze altcoins as a basket, we’ll look at two charts. First, the [Total 2 Index](https://es.tradingview.com/symbols/CRYPTOCAP-TOTAL2/), which shows the total market cap of the top 125 cryptos without BTC. This index is not static, meaning altcoins are constantly entering and falling off of the list.

Second, we’ll look at [Bitcoin dominance](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/CRYPTOCAP-BTC.D/), as if altcoins pump but Bitcoin dominance stays the same, your money was better off in Bitcoin (a less risky asset).​

# 

# The Moves

We'll be taking a look at the following four Bitcoin moves:

**​**

1. **End of 2017 Bull Run: 11/13/2017 - 12/16/2017, +242%, $6,000 - $20,000**
2. **Bear Market Pump: 6/10/2019 - 6/26/2016, +82%, $7,500 - $13,000**
3. **New ATH: 12/12/21 - 1/08/21, +134%, $18,000 - $45,000**
4. **Summer 2021 Pump: 7/21/21 - 7/30/21, +44%, $29,000 - $42,000​**

&#x200B;

# Move 1: End of 2017 Bull Run

* **11/13/2017 - 12/16/2017**
* **+242%**
* **$6,000 - $20,000**

A 242% gain in about 33 days might never happen to Bitcoin again, but if you were early enough to be there, it was mind-blowing. It was a time of infinite optimism and maybe that’s why alts surged after the ATH.

During this month-long bitcoin pump, the market cap of the top 125 altcoins moved up by 184%, meaning Bitcoin dominance went up and your money was better off in Bitcoin.

Still, not a bad result for a month of investing. But as Bitcoin dropped 23% from the 16th of December to the 4th of January, altcoins continued to pump another 123% for a total gain of 544% over 54 days: over 10% a day on average. That’s a handy little gain.

**Results:** Altcoins pumped alongside Bitcoin, then continued to pump another 123% while Bitcoin retraced.

# Move 2: 2019 Bear Market Pump

* **6/10/2019 - 6/26/2019**
* **+82%**
* **$7500 - $13000**

This move is a bit different than the others, coming in the midst of a pretty serious bear market. Nonetheless, from April to June 2019, Bitcoin tripled in price, with a final 16-day crescendo coming in early summer. Bitcoin put in a near 2x move, coming within striking distance of the all time high.

Altcoins pumped about 45% alongside Bitcoin's 82% move upwards, but afterwards? A whole lot of nothing. Over the next 22 days, Bitcoin erased its gains with a 50% drop while altcoins also got smoked, dropping 80%. While the total market cap of the top 125 altcoins hit a local high on June 26 of around 140 billion, it would take over a year to reach those levels again on August 26, 2020.

&#x200B;

**Results:** Over this time period, your money was better off in Bitcoin on the way up **and** the way down. Bitcoin dominance, with a few small slides, trended up from about 50% of total crypto market cap to nearly 75%. A blowout victory for $BTC bulls.

# Move 3: 2020 Q4 All-Time-High

* **12/12/20 - 1/08/21**
* **+134%**
* **$18,000 - $45,000**

In this euphoric, 134%, 27-day move, Bitcoin doubled its previous ATH with only five red days. It was a Bitcoiner’s wildest dream, and the Q4 move everyone has fixated on since. Bitcoin bulls love this move because after an 18-day, -28% retracement in January, it shot up again another 41% through the end of January and beginning of February.

https://preview.redd.it/l53nq72tz7v71.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=83eedafdc6e617dd5e034c3a03b2302f6237ccf3

But what happened to alts during and after the pump? During the BTC pump, the top 125 alts saw a 74% gain. So Bitcoin dominance went up, but not by much.

It was during Bitcoin's drop that altcoins flew. After Bitcoin reached a local top on the 8th of January, it collapsed by 15% and altcoins responded negatively with a 20% drop. But while Bitcoin continued to trend down with another 25% dip from the 14th to the 28th, alts put in a 33% move to the upside. After that, altcoins enjoyed a 100-day, 349% move upwards through May 12th. Bitcoin dominance slid 33% from 60% to 40%, a near all-time-low level. This was peak altcoin season.

Let’s keep in mind that Bitcoin although enjoying a few new all time highs throughout this period, Bitcoin dominance slid lower and lower. Bitcoin wasn't a bad investment by any means, but alts performed phenomenally.

**Results:** A euphoric, monthlong pump doubled the former ATH for Bitcoin and lead to a lot of very happy altcoin investors. Bitcoin dominance steadily trended down although price trended up.

&#x200B;

# Move 4: Summer 2021 Pump

* **7/21/21 - 7/30/21**
* **+44%**
* **$29,000 - $42,000**

Pulling the market out of a three-month bleed, this nine-day move pumped Bitcoin’s price by up 44%. It’s the smallest Bitcoin pump we’re covering but also the most recent, which might give us a few clues as to how today’s market behaves.

https://preview.redd.it/12f8j52uz7v71.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=0716ddd6e5a180d421cd3c211b15d6d328569634

* **An ATH rejection, then breakout**: An ATH rejection followed by a breakout, would most likely put an ‘altcoin season’ on hold, but would still be good news for altcoins. As we’ve seen, when Bitcoin pumps, altcoins pump, just not as much. Maybe after a big move and a retracement, we’d finally see a real altcoin season. Bitcoin dominance is still pretty low compared to historical levels, so it’s possible we need to see it take some market cap back before altcoins can run.
* **Bitcoin stability:** If Bitcoin just hangs out within $5k-sh of where it is today, altcoins will probably run. That chart would look pretty similar to our late 2017/early 2018 altcoin season, but could signal an end to the bull run.
* **Bitcoin dips:** Bitcoin could still take a dip, and that could mean who-knows-what for altcoins. In 2019, it was bad for alts, in the winter of 2020/2021, it was great for alts. On the bright side, it would probably mean an extended bull run, as pretty much every BTC all time high has been eventually followed by an explosion to higher levels.

If history tells us anything, it’s that altcoin pumps nearly always follow big Bitcoin moves: as to how big those moves are and how long after new Bitcoin ATHs they come, that’s anyone guess. These are a few possibilities I’ve deemed to be pretty likely, and I, for one, am stocking up on altcoins. [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) could be a good choice for more conservative investors while smaller alts look appealing to risk-tolerant crypto buyers.

The normal advice still stands: stay diversified, own Bitcoin as a backup, and have a plan to take profits.

It has been one week since Butter Token’s launch and in that time we’ve accrued $12,929.14 in the charity wallet which was donated to a food charity chosen by our community. The winner was “Food For Life Global”!

Today “Food For Life Global” charity is officially promoting Milk and Butter Token on their socials, newsletter, and mailing list after our nearly $13,000 donation! As far as we are aware this is the first time a major charity has acknowledged and promoted a crypto token! https://twitter.com/fflglobal/status/1381671076367802371?s=21

The purpose of the Butter token is to provide a fun way for token holders to give back to society. Our developer Claypool wanted to capture the fervor surrounding crypto currencies and donate to a good cause. We want to help feed the world with the help of our investors. As their investments grow, so do the donations. It’s a win-win. 

5% of transactions using the Butter token are collected by the Butter Token contract and sold into BNB that is reserved to be collected by the Charity Wallet! 

More information can be found on our website at Milktoken.net including how to get involved and start making a difference with Butter Token. Our introduction video can be found here: https://youtu.be/SaocbsBLWdc

Our developer Claypool’s comment following the donation:  “We're all very excited by the launch of the Butter Token, in just one week we've been able to secure enough funds to be donated and feed 60,000 people. We're eagerly working towards being able to make more of an impact in people's lives than we already have”

Info about our Dev: https://christianclaypool.wordpress.com/about/

This week Butter use cases grow as the ability to vote and pick charities using Butter butter is being added. The gamification of the token is also in the works to win extra money via games like lotto, bingo, etc.

Butter is now verified on BSCscan and pending approval on coingecko and CMC.

Audit for Milk token is out with Butter on the way.

Check out Thunder Protocol $THUNDER [1,843,205 $ Market cap] Hey everyone, I've been watching this interesting project. Well, it hasn't been listed on Coingecko or CoinMarketCap, but the listing requests have been submitted. This has had two audits (Read the one posted on the site [https://e836e407-9b03-42d1-9e58-2e291dbee469.usrfiles.com/ugd/e836e4\_4f9afd2569e7441e96e66341864c1d15.pdf](https://e836e407-9b03-42d1-9e58-2e291dbee469.usrfiles.com/ugd/e836e4_4f9afd2569e7441e96e66341864c1d15.pdf)), the second one was held today and we're still waiting for more info.

It's still really early and has a lot of volatility. But also had nice lateral movement and growth for a while now. So I think it's still a good entry point, and the interest in the token is still there, so it is not just a pump and dump. The tokenomics themselves with these types of coins are great and showed great performance in the past, like with Lightning Protocol ([https://charts.bogged.finance/?token=0x7B9c3Df47F3326FbC0674d51dc3EB0f2Df29F37F](https://charts.bogged.finance/?token=0x7B9c3Df47F3326FbC0674d51dc3EB0f2Df29F37F)). 

volatility Thunder Protocol is a direct fork of Lightning Protocol that works through a dynamic burn rate of \[5 to 12%\], which is applied at each Buy/Sell order. Transactions between wallets and transactions that interact with the future ecosystem are not taxed, to ensure the usability of the protocol.

volatility Concept: There are a total of 156 cycles, each cycle has a TAX amount on buy/sell. \\The TAX starts at 5% and scales to 12% per cycle. The fee gradually increases as 1.275M tokens are burnt. Cycle comes to an end when we reach total 1.275M tokens burnt, 50% of the burn amount is distributed to holders, and 50% goes to permanent burn. Each new cycle starts at 5% tax. Exchange: We will be launching on Pancakeswap 50% of all pre-sale funds will be used to provide liquidity and liquidity will be locked via Unicrypt for 6 months.

volatility How it works:

By holding Thunderstorm ""$THUNDER"" token through deflationary cycles, there will be a dramatic increment in holdings and value, rewarding early adopters the most value.The cycle life depends on volume of buy/sell and send transactions. In the early stages, we will go through cycles rapidly. The more cycles Thunderstorm finishes, the more volume it will take to finish new cycles. For Thunderstorm Holders this implies that early reception and holding gets compensated exceptionally, as Thunderstorm Rebases continue compounding and Total Supply continues to get diminished. The entirety of this is done to guarantee a drawn out store of significant worth which will be coordinated into the DeFi system.

In the longer term over the next few months, there are four primary things to look for that bring Smartlands to the next level:

* Brokerage license secured - allowing Smartlands to act as a central hub of asset tokenisation

* Series A Funding - new round of venture capital funding for Smartlands to go to the next scale of business.

Those of us who have been following Smartlands since 2018 (some even since the ICO!) can see a lot of things coming together now and we’re at a turning point in which Smartlands can really prove itself as central to the growing asset tokenisation sector.

There’s been a number of [stops and starts over the years](https://www.reddit.com/r/SmartlandsPlatform/comments/lzi3p4/a_brief_history_of_smartlands_or_what_is_up_with/), so it's always worth taking some caution with the above items, but with such a pipeline in front of us things are looking very good for what is to come next - **keep stacking and enjoy the ride!**",positive,0.82365185,33

After all, BTC was created to cut middleman in everyday transactions. Right now, we can see more countries are opening to crypto payments, and in my opinion we will see more and more in 2022.

Second thing is UI, newbies in crypto are still not tech friendly, and they need simple solutions. I would like to hear your opinion on this topic, and especially about Utrust payment platform that is driving adoption through their merchants and different services in the HOLD app.

Elongate established itself as the first, biggest and most trustworthy charity cryptocurrency token in the industry after stipulating  partnerships with EB Research, a non-profit organization for treating chrysalis , Kimbal Musk's Big Green, Children International, Action Against Hunger, The Ocean Cleanup, The Human Relief Foundation, Mark Rober's Color The Spectrum, Give India and The National Kidney foundation. Elongate raised over 3 million dollars in the first two months of existence and all donation were recorded and live streamed with presidents, vice-presidents and representatives of said foundations. All donations were in BNB.

Elongate was listed recently on a major exchange LBank (ranking #15th Worldwide in terms of 24h trading volume) and was fully certified by CertiK, a blockchain company that conducts security checks on blockchain. It was awarded a high security rating of 90/100.

Very soon, we are also planning to be listed on a top 10 exchange, which will subsequently increase trading volume by large.

YouTube personality ZHC has also decided to join Elongate and create a video to support our cause. 

To give you an example of what ELONGATE community stands for, Elongate recently made a $150,000 donation to the EB Research Partnership (EBRP), the largest global organization dedicated to funding research for the treatment of chrysalis (EB). The work of the organization is based on the treatment of chrysalis and methods for developing the treatment of millions of people suffering from other rare diseases.

Another donation was made to the Million Gardens Movement to bring gardening education and garden resources to disadvantaged communities across North America, Elongate made a donation of 400,000. U.S. dollars to Big Green, a nonprofit founded by Kimbal Musk in 2011 to tackle food-related health inequalities and create a healthier place where children can learn and grow. This year, Big Green co-launched the Million Gardens Movement with online publication Modern Farmer.

Elongate is unique in its mission, for it makes the world a better place whilst allowing you to invest in it and potentially earning from the growth of the crypto. Elongate is also in the process of launching the world's first charity-focused exchange. This includes Elongate's charity wallet, NFT campaign, and other exciting crypto innovations by the second quarter of 2021. The team just launched a revamped version of the website during the 2021 Bitcoin & Cryptocurrency conference in Miami where we also distributed merch to participants, hired a pilot to skywrite Elongate over Miami and displayed our logo on many taxis all around the conference.

We recently paid for a major marketing exposure that displayed Elongate on billboards and projected our logo on buildings all over the world (Philippines Globe of Asia, New Delhi, Paris, Barcelona, Paris, Amsterdam, Milan, London, Austin, Toronto, Berlin, Manila, Bali, Seoul, Taipei, Rio de Janeiro, Jersey UK, Vegas, Copenhagen and Seoul again). Find out more about our marketing on the pinned messages on our telegram group, please remember to use only the link from the official website [www.elongate.cc](https://www.elongate.cc)

A merch store was also recently released - 80% of all the merchandise sales will be donated to charity, the rest will be used for marketing. Elongate is currently comprised of a 475,000+ holding community, with over 315,000 followers from all platforms and channels. Two Elongate giveaways are currently active for 9000 USD and 4500 USD, these will be presented by LBank directly, the rules can be found on the official LBank Twitter page.

498,2024-06-23,"A look into Kendu Inu's growth since it was first releasedKendu has been on chain for 4 months now and the growth of the project has been quite impressive given we have stuck to an organic growth model.  I wanted to give people a few different perspectives when looking at how Kendu has grown.  I think it's important to look at not only the actual marketcap growth of the project, but the amount of new holders and also the social media growth that we've seen so far as well.  

**Market Cap Growth**

It took Kendu Inu 11 days to go from launch to 1million mcap.  It took roughly the same amount of time to go from 1million mcap to 10million mcap.

After it hit 10million mcap, there was a consolidation period where it took roughly 2 months to reach that 10m mcap again.  Once it did, it then took only 5 days to go from 10m to 50m.

Once it hit 50m, guess what? Yep, another consolidation period.  Difference is this time it only took 1 month to reach 50m again.  Just like before, once that previous all time high was reached again, we skyrocketed.  It took about 5 days to go from 50m to 250m. 

If you're catching on by now, when we hit 250m we started another consolidation period. That's where we are currently and it's only been less than 2 weeks since we hit 250m.  Given the trends that we've seen before I would expect this consolidation period to take less than a month and when we touch that all time high again at 250m, there's no telling what our new all time high will be.

**Holder Growth**

Obviously the mcap growth will also be reflected in the amount of new holders we have gotten but I still think it's good to know what that aspect of our growth has looked like as well.  

From launch, it took about a month to go from 0 holders to 1000 holders. 

Going from 1000 to 10000 holders only took about 2 1/2 months.

You can just see by the numbers that Kendu is growing in exponential fashion.  Obviously yes there were slower times and faster times during these periods of new holder growth, but the end result cannot be argued.  Something to recognize as well, we celebrated seeing 10000 holders as a really big achievement, but in the grand scheme of things, we are still extremely small.  Shiba Inu has 1.4 million holders.  We are currently at a fraction of that amount and have so so much room to grow still.  

**Reddit Growth**   

I wanted to throw in this growth metric as well because we're all redditors at the end of the day and I think it's important that whatever project you buy into, also has a substantial Reddit community backing it.  I personally don't like to see projects shilled on Reddit, without having any actual presence on Reddit itself.  Seems a little shady to me.

The reddit community was created around mid March 2024.  

It took roughly a month to go from 0 members to 100 members.  

In the same amount of time it went from 100 members to 1000 members.

In the same amount of time again, it went from 1000 members to 3000 members.  

Again, the growth we are seeing is exponential and it's all organic.  You can visit our subreddit and you will see that it is all real people who are all in on Kendu.  You might think, oh well I see other memecoins reach the front pages of the various crypto subreddits and and come to the conclusion that they must be very active on Reddit.  Well unfortunately, upvotes reign supreme on Reddit and it is not difficult at all to pay Reddit marketing accounts to bot a post to the front page.  Pay attention to the comment section and you'll see that Kendu posts are from real people, who have real interests in seeing Kendu grow organically; the difference is very obvious if you pay attention to the content!

**Future**

This post just gives a little insight into how Kendu has grown so far and we're still only 4 months old.  There is so much time and room to grow even larger and it's hard to predict how big we can get, but I guarantee it's going to outperform everyone's expectations.  I implore you to join our subreddit or our telegram to find out more about Kendu before you buy in.  Ask any questions you might have, and you'll have a plethora of people willing to answer.

500,2023-04-25,"What are your thoughts on airdrops?  

Personally, I thought Airdrops was a myth because I couldn't earn anything from them for a long time. 

Before we go any further, what are airdrops and why are they distributed? 

An airdrop is a marketing approach in which coins or tokens are sent to wallet addresses. Small amounts of the new virtual currency are transferred to the wallets of active blockchain community members for free or in exchange for a minor service, such as retweeting a message issued by the company creating the currency. A crypto airdrop's ultimate purpose is to raise awareness and circulation of a new token or coin.

Now that we know what airdrops are, I'm sure some people have been lucky enough to earn from them in the past, such as with ARB, which is still the most recent one that has changed my mind about airdrops. 

I got up to $5000 in ARB from the airdrop, which I quickly sold. Since then, I've been looking for airdrops to see if I can get a decent one like ARB. 

I've been following up on this CHUNKS Airdrop for about 2 weeks now; it's new, but I believe it might have the ability to offer even more than ARB because it wants to airdrop 5% of its overall supply, which is massive. The tasks to participate in aren't too difficult, and I've already begun them, so I thought I'd share.

502,2022-01-11,"$TKING a true gem in the altcoin space, or just another memecoin with dreams of becoming something more? 

I've been spending quite a number of years in the crypto sphere, and beyond the usual top 100 tokens out there, it has been quite difficult to find a good altcoin which offers something unique to invest in.

When $TKING launched I dropped like $30 into the token for the LOLs because I enjoyed the show. But after the token suddenly gained significantly in the market, I had a look at the fundamentals and what it had to offer.

Even though the token only shot up in value because some people wanted to pump it (Matt Wallace), I found that [Chainchat.app](https://chainchat.app/) was a revolutionary idea. So I added several thousand dollars in coins to my portfolio.

I might be wrong, but this is a true gem and when Chainchat launches out of beta with full escrow services, I could see a world where people would jump on this to trade NFTs, and even tokens.

What do you guys think? Will Chainchat be something more than just another dApp in the market fighting for relevance?

https://i.redd.it/tsf9owdntbq71.gif

Today is a *huge* day for crypto — the [Syscoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/syscoin/) Smart Contract Public Testnet is now live (yes, that's right — it's not a mythical whitepaper — it's a *living, breathing smart contract beast* waiting for you!) You can now build *whatever app you want* on top of the most innovative network in crypto!

## Sounds Cool, But Why Would I Build On Syscoin (Shouldn't I Just Build It On ETH or SOL)?

Well, to name just a few:

* Any app you can build on Ethereum can be built on Syscoin (DeFi? DEX? Other Dapps starting in D? You name it — you can build it here!) 
* The code is open-sourced — Syscoin has nothing to hide! 
* The Syscoin network has been audited by third party industry leaders (for both speed and security!) 
* Speaking of, Syscoin is ultra-secure (it's actually merge-mined with bitcoin — giving it the **second highest hash rate** of any crypto coin in the universe!) secure
* Did I mention its scalability was designed to accommodate ""smart cities""? 
* The Syscoin network is nimble and will power the NFT innovations for years to come (fractional / divisible NFTs, royalties, auctions, the [Luxy.io](http://luxy.io/) marketplace ...) 
* Want to make a serious stablecoin (or a silly meme-coin?) You can mint those for super cheap on Syscoin. crypto
* The complementary Chrome-extension [PaliWallet](https://twitter.com/PaliWallet) will hit the Chrome app store on October 5th (one wallet for all of your SYS, BTC, ETH, MATIC / Polygon & Web3 needs!) 
* This team has a track record of delivering the goods since 2014 (true OGs!)

Billions of trees are cut down every year. That's about 2,000 since you started reading this sentence.

Every time BlossomCoin is bought or sold, a portion goes to our charity wallet. The value of this wallet (up to 0.5% of current market cap) will then be donated to charities focusing on reforestation efforts every month.

Tokenomics:

 30% of original supply burned - now 36%

 5% distributed to holders per transaction

 5% burned per transaction

 1% donated to planting trees per transaction

They've just done their third weekly donation of $3k to charity, and will be doing bigger ones every week! Devs have also announced on their website that they'll be doxing very soon!

They're already listed on CoinGecko and CMC (less than 3 days after launch), and the Telegram community is legit - everyone's really invested and can see this is a long-term project for the greater good.

The dev team are really responsive and have been answering loads of questions in the Telegram, they've got a full team behind them of developers, graphic designers, web devs and have already begun the audit process - super legit.

Recent concerns about BTC energy usage is gonna send green cryptos parabolic, and this is looking like the best one so far! The roadmap on their website is solid and aggressive, with listings on all major exchanges in the line-up - the devs are clearly in this for the long run.

Check out the whitepaper on their website, it shows a unique and ambitious plan for the token, you can tell how serious the team behind this are!

Syrius Zenon wallet introduction https://youtu.be/t6A7vKhp-MY

based anon explanation What is it: Incredibly fast, almost infinitely scalable state-of-the-art DLT. It combines the block-lattice architecture that was first(?) used by Raiblocks/Nano with a DAG that exists as a separate layer for the consensus. The block-lattice handles the transactions. It's going to be used to scale Web3 dapps as a L1, and also process transactions as a L2 chain.

Who does it: This is an independent, open-source project and will probably be run by a foundation similar to Ethereum and Cardano, but I'm about 99.5% sure its backed by Square. I can enumerate the zillions of times they have hinted as such if I really have to here, but you can search for old biz posts on Zenon here and also on Warosu.

Square will likely use it to scale Bitcoin transactions where the default payment for merchants and Cashapp users is made in BTC, and then they can set it to dollars or pounds or whatever afterwards.

Its open source and not owned by Square, like how Node.js isn't owned by Google but has wide adoption. They'll easily recruit 1000s of legacy web apps for this bc no code changes are needed, and also dapps on Ethereum will easily switch over.",positive,0.93000215,30

I'm sure alot of you would have experienced significant issues with bnb withdraw on binance and buying coins on pancakeswap recently. 

This is where Copiosa comes in to mitigate all the token swap hassles by providing a seamless cross chain platform where users could deposit their countries' fiat currency on Copiosa's exchange to buy the platform's native token $COP and instantly swap for all the new small mc coin that are available on the platform. 

You might ask why do we need copiosa when we already have pancakeswap? The answer is simple, purchasing small mc coin is extremely difficult in the current climate for the none tech savvy people as it involves buying bnb from one exchange, sending the token to your wallet, copy and paste the contract address of coin you want to purchase, then there's all the fees associated with approving for trade and sell, token swap, although the fees are small but they add up over time. And not to mention many people have missed opportunities on buying coins on the dip because their bnb is stuck in transfer from binance. Copiosa aims to solve this issue by providing a platform where the token swap and purchasing is done in one place.",positive,0.89363444,27

It is the perfect time to buy $BUTTER token. This is a real hidden gem with an extremely LOW MARKET CAP of 182K. All bots and whales have left and rug pull isn’t possible with liquidity locked until 2022. 

This is by far the most unique BEP-20 token out there and it’s partnership with “Food For Life Global” shows the potential seen by big companies https://ffl.org/20077/cryptocurrency-butter-token/

If that is not enough, Paul Turner CEO of FFLG, is meeting with Coin Base in San Francisco this week to discuss Butter and Milk tokens! Just imagine the growth by getting listed on Coin Base.

The use cases for this token are growing every week and once the masses see this coin it’s potential is easily 100x. 
Week 1: 5% of all transactions go to charity 
Week 2: Voting added to pick which charities are in the poll and then decide which one wins the weekly donation! https://www.milktoken.net/voting.html
Week 3: A lotto system and bingo are being added so that there is gamification of the token.
 
There are weekly AMAs with the devs including one tonight! It is being streamed on Twitch here: https://www.twitch.tv/milkbuttertoken

For those that don’t know, Butter Token is the first BEP-20 token to partner with a major Food charity and it has donated so much in just one week ($17,000) with a low market cap! For reference, if it had a $100 million market cap $4 million would have gone to charity already. Butter really has the potential to end world hunger!

The best part is that the process is trust-less and automatic. 5% of all transactions are GUARANTEED to go to charity. You can then help choose which charities are available to vote on (partnered charities will always be an option), and then vote on which of the decided charity options get the accrued donation for that week!

Helping yourself by investing, also helps those in need! Milk and Butter have the potential to revolutionize the crypto market having already made crypto history thanks to its Partnership with [“Food For Life Global”](https://ffl.org/about-us/our-partners-sponsors/)”, (a charity promoted by Paul McCartney).

This will bring awareness to those that have never dabbled in crypto, but still want to help out charity while investing in themselves. The [website ](https://www.milktoken.net) will continue to be refined so that the guides and interface are able to introduce anyone to the workings of cryptocurrency.

To help spread the word there is giveaway this week. Refer a friend and join socials for entries. The winner will receive 50 Billion Milk AND 50 Million Butter. Here is link: https://www.milktoken.net/giveaway.html

Here are the most interesting details:


**Liquidity Boost & Stakeholder Commitment**: Ctrl Wallet is launching a 12-month liquidity provision program for its $XDEFI token, with major holders (including Delphi Digital, Mechanism Capital, and others) committing 32% of the total $XDEFI supply to Uniswap pools. This shows long-term confidence in the project while deepening liquidity and reducing selling pressure.



**Tokenomics Overhaul**: The project is introducing a new token unlocking schedule tied to performance milestones, starting in March 2025. Tokens will unlock at different stages of the $XDEFI token reaching $100M, $200M, $300M, and $500M fully diluted valuations.



**Incentivized Liquidity**: Investors locking their tokens in AMM pools will earn a 10% APY on their deposits, but the treasury’s tokens are excluded from this benefit, aligning rewards with external contributors.

514,2022-03-24,"RBIF Weekly: Holder Percentages, Mean Holdings, Median Holdings + BurntQuotation from: [https://www.reddit.com/r/roboinu/comments/tktace/weekly\_holder\_percentages\_mean\_holdings\_median/](https://www.reddit.com/r/roboinu/comments/tktace/weekly_holder_percentages_mean_holdings_median/)

**Hello and welcome to all the new wallets and new holders!**

This is my weekly update on some of the holder stats and RBIF information. I am getting information from etherscan so I do not know how this interacts with Bitmart, however I assume that these numbers only include transactions outside of Bitmart. Until the Bitmart transactions are available on etherscan these stats only tell part of the story.

The first figure below shows the percentage of circulating RBIF held by the top 10, 50, 100 and 1000 wallets. As the changes are quite small and difficult to see on the figure I have also made a table below to show how this has changed over the last week.

[ The percentage of circulating RBIF held by the top 10, 50, 100 and 1000 wallets over time. ](https://preview.redd.it/43pmj0jzdcp81.png?width=5905&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f0e8350fcde086bcc4e7f90b2927556878629b2)

All of the holder percentages have increased this week. This is due to the 1 % burn that happened last week, as the total circulating RBIF has decreased by about 1.7% it is expected that all these percentages will rise. **One of the top 10 wallets have sold a small amount of their tokens or moved them (90 Trillion of 1.8 Quadrillion).**

https://preview.redd.it/d6ku7tnnecp81.png?width=639&format=png&auto=webp&s=68e1e5e147d403d02e18a2000b2c83fbc4613bd8

The second figure below shows the mean and median wallet size on the left and the percentage of circulating RBIF on the right. I have added the marketing wallet to this pie chart. I have also made a table to show the changes in the last week.

[\(Left\) Mean wallet sizes in red and median wallet sizes in blue \(Right\) percentage of RBIF in circulation and burnt.](https://preview.redd.it/2wkh4wasecp81.png?width=6850&format=png&auto=webp&s=fade17a6ad706d9a8c706fdd366403070d1f966b)

The mean and median wallet sizes have both decreased. The mean wallet size has decreased from 19.4 Trillion RBIF to 18.6 Trillion RBIF (0.74 Trillion). This is again good news and the high mean is due to a very small number of wallets holding a quadrillion coins or up (20) which skews the mean. I feel like the median wallet size is more representative. This has also come down from 0.77 Trillion RBIF to 0.72 Trillion RBIF (- 43 Billion). Again reducing the size of the median wallet should bring more stability to the tokens price.

**1.01 Quadrillion RBIF** have been burnt in the last week the majority of which is due to the 1 % burn at the end of last week and the marketing wallet has decreased by **0.95 Quadrillion RBIF,** this is again due to the burn, which burnt tokens from the marketing wallet. The marketing wallet has started building up again after this, however as most transactions are being done in Bitmart, this recovery will take a while.

https://preview.redd.it/6w0l3yoyecp81.png?width=641&format=png&auto=webp&s=0d7d2e60bd975562061b2c2a802d6e8e450bf523

We have also had **114 new wallets** on Etherscan in the last week (2955-3069) and the subreddit has grown by **41 users** (4233-4274). We are currently getting **17 approximately new wallets** a day for the last week. The rate of new wallets was increasing steadily to reach the burn value of 3000 wallets. This has now peaked and there has been a slight decrease in the rate of new wallets.

516,2021-11-05,"Five Underrated Metrics for Evaluating Altcoins>**“Without data you’re just another person with an opinion.” - W. Edwards Deming**

I write about [high potential altcoins](https://cryptopragmatist.com/sign-up/) for a living, and as I see more and more new investors come to the space, I see more and more misconceptions about how altcoins work, grow, and behave.

To help educate newer members of the community and refresh experienced ones on the fundamentals, today I’m going to discuss five metrics that are absolutely necessary to understand if you want to make informed investments into altcoins.

What these metrics all have in common is the fact that they’re objective and indisputable; the reality can be interpreted in different ways, but these metrics are unarguable. Due to this certainty, they represent a foundation on which we can come to more reasoned and (hopefully) profitable conclusions. 

Not only can these stats help us find hidden altcoin gems, they can also help us avoid red flags. The concepts are in no particular order.

# 1. Market Cap

**Where It’s Found:** CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap, TradingView

**Definition:** Market Cap is a measure of the total size of a cryptocurrency. It’s the price of a single token multiplied by the total amount of tokens in circulation. Diluted market cap reflects the price of a single token multiplied by the total amount of tokens that will ever be created.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/quzrxsg43vx71.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b85fdf396c5d35d910dc65e079a6ed081601a97

**Interpreting Market Cap:**

Market cap is meaningful because the size of a crypto helps us understand how much growth is possible or reasonable. For a given cryptocurrency to double in price, it requires an exponential increase in the input of capital. Check out the graph below:

&#x200B;

[This is an oversimplification, as price can move up or down on smaller volumes, but on average it holds relatively true.](https://preview.redd.it/1wang3w43vx71.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e3e19b6a758fa2a8f91f5e7047b74c082179549)

For a real-life example, Bitcoin experienced a 1000x that took only 30 months (Sep 2010 - Mar 2013) when price went from $0.06 to $60. The next 1000x took 96 months. Another 1000x from today would value Bitcoin at 1.14 quadrillion dollars, over 12 times the size of the entire world economy. It probably just won’t happen. 

And for Bitcoin to double from today’s price, it would require an injection of over $1 trillion of capital. It’s possible, but no small feat. But a $1 million altcoin could absolutely experience a 1000x. It would require less than $1 billion of new capital, which wouldn’t even put it in the top 100 cryptos by market cap. This is also the reason [Shiba Inu](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/shiba-inu/) won't go to a dollar.

**Why It’s Important:** The previous graph shows us that the majority of an altcoin’s gains happen early in its life cycle. So although smaller cryptos are a lot riskier, they have a lot more upside because less capital can move the price. 

# 2. Total Value Locked

**Where It’s Found:** CoinGecko

**Definition:** The sum of all assets deposited (or locked) in a given protocol. Assets are locked up to provide collateral for loans, generate interest, or be staked for more coins.  

**Interpreting Total Value Locked:**

Cryptocurrencies are valuable for all kinds of reasons—Bitcoin is valuable because it’s a decentralized, transferrable store of value. Monero is valuable because it’s a private currency. Ethereum is valuable because it creates smart contracts, decentralized agreements to store and transfer value between network users across time. 

Total Value Locked (TVL) is based on that third type of value, the idea that value can be stored within a crypto by being deposited, used as collateral, used as liquidity, or staked for interest. The dollar value locked within a protocol is one way to estimate the intrinisic, fundamental value of that asset. 

So what does this TVL mean for the value of a given cryptocurrency? Some ecosystems generate enormous cash flows and fees on value locked, which are then distributed back to users (Maker DAO and Abracabra Money would be some examples). With protocols like AAVE, the fees generated are used to buy back the token and burn it, creating a deflationary supply. Uniswap doesn’t even charge fees for the use of their protocol, but all of the assets locked up inside represent real value.

https://preview.redd.it/nuvfmbz53vx71.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=634d57f0f96837a4aff54b8d949d98bb5ff4b600

A closely related statistic to TVL is the TVL ratio, which is the ratio of a crypto's market cap to its total value locked. In many cases, investors see a crypto with a TVL ratio of less than one as a signal that it’s undervalued, while a TVL ratio of over one means that the asset may be overvalued. That’s an oversimplification, and some valuable cryptos (Bitcoin, for one) have no TVL. That doesn’t make them valueless by any means. 

Instead of using TVL to value the protocol itself, use it to understand how that value generates wealth for token holders and demand for the cryptocurrency.

**Why It’s Important:** Total value locked can give you a look at the health of a crypto ecosystem and an idea of the intrinsic value created by the protocol.

&#x200B;

# 3. Inflation Rate

**Where It’s Found:** Whitepapers, Official Documentation, Google

**Definition:** Inflation rate is the rate at 4 the supply of tokens of a cryptocurrency increases. A supply inflates as coins/tokens are mined or created via staking.

**Interpreting Inflation Rate:**

Inflation represents how tokens are created in a crypto ecosystem, a key aspect of the supply side of a crypto. As tokens are created, they are added to the market and must be offset by more demand for the token. If demand doesn’t outpace that new supply, he crypto will go down in price. 

Some cryptos are deflationary. Bitcoin will one day have no inflation, and once Ethereum mines its whole supply, it will be deflationary, with tokens burned in every transaction. You can see the token issuance schedules of those cryptos in the graphs below. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/of8uryv93vx71.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f846f586a7715e6b70015c053aacf0d034162b8

An inflationary supply isn’t necessarily a bad thing, and a deflationary supply isn’t always a good thing, but if we understand how the production affects supply and demand, we can better understand the forces causing a crypto to move up or down in price.    

**Why It’s Important:** The inflation rate allows us to understand how the supply of a given cryptocurrency changes. The higher the inflation, the bigger the crypto needs to grow to hold the same token price.

# 4. Coin Distribution

**Where It’s Found:** Official Documentation, White Papers, Blockchain explorers

**Definition:** Analyzing coin distribution involves looking at the spread of tokens across the network and seeing if that distribution is overly concentrated.  

**Interpreting Coin Distribution:**

Perhaps the most important principle behind cryptocurrency is decentralization: the idea that distributing power over a network gives us freedom and autonomy. When coins are concentrated, the integrity of that network is compromised and the power becomes concentrated. Uneven distribution also creates issues around price manipulation. 

Distributed networks prevent small groups of people from gaining too much control over the protocol or manipulating the price. When a token is launched, a distribution is slayed out for founders and investors. You can see this distribution for some of the biggest cryptos below.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/l6485rcb3vx71.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3b440a1f5fdb33045d62f156875ac662a1a2737

But as the crypto grows and matures, that distribution changes. Since most blockchains are public, we can actually use blockchain explorers like etherscan.io to see what percentage of supply the biggest wallets control. Here are the biggest wallets on Shiba Inu, for example:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/u22rngyb3vx71.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=9dacd939d84aefd54c44c5c508eb9c5c3fd651f2

Some of the addresses are known, and are labeled. The #1 address is a burn address, meaning SHIB was sent there and can't be recovered (cryptos do use burns as a deflationary tactic). The #4 wallet holds $2 billion in Shiba, over 4%. A sale that big could tank the price.

**Why It’s Important:** If coins or tokens are unevenly distributed, it means certain groups and individuals have more power over the token and its price. This is bound to happen to some extent, but the bigger the disparity becomes, the bigger the problem becomes. 

# 5. Volume Traded

**Where It’s Found:** CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap

**Definition:** Volume traded is the amount of value, typically measured in dollars, being traded back and forth over a given time period. 

**Interpreting Volume Traded:**

When we enter or exit a trade, we’re participating in an open market where we interact with a real person on the other side of the screen. The sum of all the people trading in a given market is the volume, and the more value being traded back and forth, the more efficient and liquid that market typically is.

Volume is important because it can help us avoid participating in illiquid markets that are likely to be manipulated. Iliquid markets also make it dificult to enter and exit trades. Take a look at the graph below:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/y39fhzbf3vx71.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=d16b7af58fa08f14a01ec02c19381e9aaf96bc66

Each of those flat spots is a time period where there were no trades happening—you couldn’t have exited the trade for the market price at that point in time. Services like CoinGecko can show you all the markets and volume metrics for a cryptocurrency in a single place. Large cap cryptos will obviously have more volume, but plenty of small cap cryptos have enough volume to be liquid for small investors. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/24fhfawf3vx71.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=2aa29ecb5e416dd1e17ebdbdfe782530a509d0d2

Centralized exchanges (CEXes) can provide valuable signals regarding liquidity and volume. When an altcoin is listed on a CEX, it means the team has deemed the asset liquid enough to have a fair and efficient market, and that there will be enough trading volume around that asset to produce fee revenue for the exchange. 

**Why It’s Important:** Cryptos that don’t trade on much volume are more inefficient markets and may result in you getting a raw deal when you enter and exit the trade. More liquid markets with higher volume are less likely to be manipulated. 

# Wrapping Up

My goal as an independent altcoin researcher is to help crypto investors make thesis-backed, intelligent investing decisions. While these statistics are all-encompassing by no means, they will help you avoid common red flags and aid in your search for undervalued gems. Happy hunting!

522,2021-04-14,"Take a Look At Hoge. Here’s a real breakdown of the project. Why you want to take another look at Hoge,

I know, you think Hoge is a shi/tcoin. You probably think the bubble has burst. 

**Let me tell you why you are wrong**

Hoge is the 2nd fastest growing coin on the Eth chain in history. It is here to stay. 

**Hoge is more than a crypto. Here’s Four reasons why. I’ll keep it short and sweet.**

**Reason One:**
Hoge is now an established legal entity in France. This means that Hoge is here to stay with doxxed developers. Furthermore, Hoge is now trademarked and protected on a marketing front. Not to mention the sky net security score or 96 AND the Audit by Certik that should be finalized on Friday 4/16- along with the BigONE listing. 

**Reason Two:**
The developers are constantly communicating and being transparent to the community. They have been busy at work over the last few months and have not shown any signs of giving up. There have been numerous developments that have been released including their promises to work on new exchanges.

**Reason three:**
Exchanges. Hoge will be listed on BigONE on Friday, 4/16. This is a huge exchange and will certainly bring massive amounts of volume into HOGE. In the future of 2021 Q2, the U.S market plans to be targeted. We have secured billboards across Las Vegas and are planning to market and work with a US based exchange to offer a one tap buy for HOGE. 

**Reason Four:**
Do you have animals? Do you like animals? If yes to either, introduce HOGE. The only audited legal team that has actually given to charity. Hell, there is even a forum on the official hoge website to guide shelters step by step into creating a charity wallet. The fact is, HOGE is the only crypto out right now that is legally giving funds to help a good cause. If you like anything to do with animals, Hoge is your coin. 

**FAQ**

Why would I invest in HOGE?
I’m not saying to invest... but the TA charts are looking extremely bullish and volume is picking up considerably. With the addition of BIGONE I think Hoge will find a huge jump. 

What are the next developments?
There is a full roadmap on the website. For short term though, marketing in the US will ramp up and talks with US based exchanges will commence following that. 

What else?
Hoge game labs is starting to form exponentially fast. Hoge has formed an e-sports team and begun developing a Dapp based gaming system. 

“It’s JuSt a MeMe CoIn”:
Fantastic, and so is doge. Explain to me why doge is now the 10th largest crypto? Use case for HOGE is already here from their gaming perspective to the animal charity support. Enough with the FUD, the age of Altcoin is upon us. Jump on or get left in the dust.

524,2020-04-19,"FAQ for Beginners----------------------------------------------------------
What is Bitcoin?
----------------------------------------------------------

Bitcoin is scarce, decentralized, and global digital **money** that cannot be censored.

* Transactions once confirmed generally cannot be reversed
* Less than 21 million Bitcoin will exist 
* Bitcoin is highly divisible to allow for micro-transactions (up to 13 decimal places in a payment channel)
* Bitcoin is an open, collaborative project that no company or government controls belonging to the people
* Bitcoin is more than just money, but a secure timestamping ledger, payment rail, and smart contract platform

Please read the Whitepaper for an general overview of bitcoin as designed 

https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf

----------------------------------------------------------
Quick Advice
----------------------------------------------------------

* **Do not respond to strangers messaging you** with investment advice or offers and read how to avoid being scammed from the posts below.

* Do not *invest* in Bitcoin until you do basic research, paid off all high interest debt, and have a emergency savings account of a stable fiat currency.  

* If *investing* do not expect to get rich quickly. You should expect to wait *at least* 1-2 years before taking profits. Bitcoin is currently very volatile. In the interim spend and replace Bitcoin because its a useful currency. 

* Beginners should avoid all mining and day trading until at least very familiar with Bitcoin. Mining is very professional(You cannot efficiently mine with your computer and need to buy special ASIC machines) and most people lose money day trading. 

* Never store your Bitcoins on an exchange or web wallet. Buy your bitcoins and withdraw it to your personal wallet where you actually own them instead of IOUs. Services like  webull, and Revoult should be avoided because you cannot withdraw or use Bitcoin. 

* Make sure you make a backup of your wallet(software holding keys to your BTC) and preferably keep it offline and physical and private. Typically 12 to 24 words you write down on paper or metal. This onetime backup will restore all your keys, addresses , and Bitcoins on a new wallet if you lose your old wallet.

* Beginners should avoid altcoins, tokens, and ICOs at least initially until they learn about Bitcoin. Most of these are scams and you should be familiar with the basics first. Bitcoin is referred to as BTC or XBT.

Note: Exchanges all have unique market prices and spreads so fees alone will not tell you the best rates. Best way is to directly compare the rates between exchanges. Buy fees above are for normal trading volumes. Verification and hold times can vary based upon lack of history, verification level or credit.

During bull markets when exchanges are extra busy it is normal to see very slow and poor customer support due to the amount of new clients and support tickets. We see many complaints due to this across all these exchanges. This is part of the reason this subreddit exists , to help answer questions for new users.

Before long I walked away from the space, not realizing that I was nothing but a tourist at the time. Full scale adoption never happened. Until yesterday morning I felt the same way with what has been happening the past week. That adoption was imminent.

I finally realized that bitcoin buzz is what it is because I put my eyes and ears in range of bitcoin information. In the online circles I frequent crypto is a done deal. Everyone understands and believes in the crypto future.

Offline, not a single person I've spoken to has a clue what is going on, besides being aware of bitcoins existence. 

The majority of these people are firmly middle class, looking at retirement within the next 20 years, and have investment vehicles they rarely if ever look at besides to check a paper statement for their bottom line.

We are early. Our neighbors will be scrapping for satoshis in 10 years while we look at a cold wallet with .003 BTC thankful we can pay for a nice vacation and buy presents for everyone while we are gone.

I expect volatility. People will take profits and re enter lower, that is how markets work. Being down in a position does not mean you have lost money. You don't lose money until you sell. I won't sell because I believe the future is in crypto.

535,2021-02-04,"To everybody getting into BTC (and also experienced holders): DO NOT SHARE THE SEED OF YOUR WALLET!After recently reading a multitude of similar posts, I would like to state two things that I would consider as essential when getting into BTC:

1. Do not leave substantial sums of cryptocurrencies on an exchange! As most of you have probably already read, ""Not your keys, not your Bitcoin!"". Even though you might be tired of hearing this (or in case you have never heard it), the statement is 100% accurate. When your BTC is stored on an exchange, they are in control of it and even though the occurance of exchanges being hacked has gone down, human errors or theft from employees of the exchanges still take place. Hence, if you own a substantial amount of BTC, get a hardware wallet and transfer your crypto onto it.
2. NEVER, under no circumstances share the seed (recovery phrase) of your wallet! Even though the packaging of most hardware wallets states this multiple times and during the installation process you are reminded again, there are still posts talking about scams, from both experienced and inexperienced BTC holders that have been scammed by sharing their seed. Customer service is never going to contact you and ask for your seed or for you to type it in somewhere. The only time you will need your seed is to transfer or recover your wallet. Also don't store your seed on a device that is connected to the internet (smartphone, pc, etc.), as this makes the whole reasoning behind storing the seed on a piece of paper or metal obsolete. Even if the device connects only once to the internet, it could become vulnerability as malware or other software could gain acces to the seed of your wallet and hence to the crypto stored in it. Therefore, keep it on a piece of paper or engrave it on a metal plate. Also don´t take a picture of the seed, this might sound obvious but trust me I have heard about enough stories like these.

So please take the two things I stated into consideration in case you are getting ready to purchase BTC or think whether you followed both tips in case you already own BTC. You will save yourself a lot of headaches in the future and won´t spread the message that it is difficult and unsafe to buy crpytocurrencies and store them. Even if you don´t want to do it for yourself, do it for the crypto community.

*(I know that the information in this post might seem redundant and obvious to some people but I believe that we as a community must do more prevention work in order to prevent fraud and crypto loss from happening and to improve the public perception of BTC and other currencies.)*

To my mind the best answers so far have been: to circumvent the government in terms of both prohibition and taxes, discounts, to take advantage of what you think is a high bitcoin value that will soon be corrected, and to take and spend profits.

Less helpful answers so far seemed to assume or center around the idea of a 100% bitcoin economy or lifestyle. Obviously we don’t live in that world now and the reason I don’t convert all of my fiat to bitcoin (since I think the value will increase) is 1) that’s a huge gamble and 2) the volatility.

546,2021-06-11,"Let’s start using “bits” as a main denominator instead of “sats” or “bitcoins”. Check why it is so much better.People are pushing the usage of Sats instead of Bitcoins denominator but we should adopt and use the Bits denominator instead as it is the best one possible. My reasonings are:

- It consists of 100 sats, so it is similar with the most common currencies like USD and Euro;

- We'll be able to price things with bits.sats just like we price things with dollars.cents (e.g. $5.50) or euros.cents;

- It is much easier to calculate from BTC because it is BTC/1000/1000. 1000x is what is generally used to show the next order of magnitude in almost anywhere (1 thousand is 1000, 1 GB = 1000 x 1000 KB, 1 tone is 1000 x 1000 grams);

- BTC scares people because ""it's too high"" and sats is a bit intuitive because it's too small. Most people will never be able to afford 1 BTC and it's impossible to own 1 sat (dust limit) unless on lightning;

- Currently 1 bit is 4 cents which is easy to understand. If BTC reaches 1m, that will make 1 bit = $1 which will make pricing a breeze. And if BTC's total market cap reaches 100T, that would translate to 1 bit = $5 which is again pretty straightforward for everyone as most currencies fluctuates between $0.01 and $2;

- We don't use cents to price things in the real world so trying to make ""sats"" the main denominator would be counterintuitive to people outside of crypto;
 
- According to [Adam Back ](https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/1335354258858905604?s=21) the satoshi (sat) was initially intended the to be a 2digit decimal bitcent after the smallest base unit, which was supposed to be a bit;

- It just sounds good and make sense to have bits be the main currency of the internet.

Tell others if you agree and ask the wallets developers to support “bits” as a default denominator.",positive,0.9216385,419

548,2021-02-21,"My journey into bitcoin (the steps I took as a complete noob in the US)I've been on the fence about bitcoin for years but this past week I finally decided to take the plunge. This is what I did...

1. Logged into CashApp which I already had, I just wanted to make sure all my info was accurate and I was using the correct bank account.

2. Enabled bitcoin transfers in CashApp, I needed to take pics of the front and back of my driver's license and a pic of my face. It took maybe 5 minutes for everything to be verified.

3. Bought $100 worth of bitcoin directly from my bank account.

4. Downloaded ""Green: Bitcoin Wallet"" from the play store. Created an account and wrote down my seed words on a piece of paper that is now in my safe.

5. Transferred 100,000 sats from CashApp to Green using the code created by Green.

6. Waited in agony for a couple minutes for my wallet to see the transfer.

That's literally it, took maybe 10-15 minutes. After the small amount transferred successfully and was verified by Green, I sent the rest of my balance over. The only fee I paid was to purchase the sats, everything else was free using those apps.

Since those first steps I have created an account with Coinbase Pro to hopefully buy and transfer coins for a bit cheaper fee. I also downloaded ""Delta Investment Portfolio Tracker"" to keep track of my purchases and profits. And lastly I ordered a Trezor One wallet. It was honestly all very confusing at first, but now that I've done it I can't believe how easy it was! Just start with a small amount to learn the steps, after your first transaction you will be kicking yourself for waiting so long.

556,2020-12-30,"My steps to get started with BTCI wanted to share the steps I took to get started and ready to buy Bitcoin.  I hope this helps another newbie. Also welcome any comments on how to improve!

1.	Read Satoshi’s white paper and familiarize yourself with basics of Bitcoin.  Trick is to understand fundamentals about what it is and the volatility, without getting lost in details that I didn't  need. At this point, the only decision I needed to make is whether to buy a small amount or not.  The FAQ of this subreddit has great resources, too.

2.	Order a hardware wallet; it will take a while. (I ordered a Trezor One).

3.	Get on an exchange (I chose Coinbase Pro).  You will need to be verified (the ""know your customer"" or KYC process)

4.	Set up your Trezor once it arrives.
https://wiki.trezor.io/Getting_started_in_5_steps
- Make sure any holographic seals were not disturbed, connect, 
, install Trezor Bridge (I have a Chrome browser) and install latest firmware ASAP.  Verify the firmware on screen and on the vendor's site. Be very careful to ensure you are at the correct website when doing this.	
- Create a wallet and initialize the device so that it creates a seed. Backup the seed on paper (some people say also on steel – I’m putting a handwritten copy in my safe).

5.	Create a checking account with small amount for bitcoin purchases only (I used ally.com, and I have no other accounts with them).

6.	Link checking account with Coinbase Pro

7.	Go to trade –> deposit –> USD -bank account enter small amount. Now you can buy bitcoin.

8.	Go to trade - > order -> place order for bitcoin.

9.	After order is filled, connect Trezor One and open up Trezor website

10.	Go to address book in Coinbase Pro.  Click whitelisting; go to Trezor and go to Receive, copy destination address; add to address book in Coinbase Pro

11.	Go back to Coinbase Pro main trading page and click withdraw. Set crypto address/ amount

12.	Send small balance (that you won’t miss) to your Trezor wallet. Click on “withdraw” on left hand navigation page under Wallet Balance. Click on the address that you’ve white listed as destination. Note there are 2-step authentication steps and it takes some time before it shows up in your wallet

13.	Reset (wipe) your Trezor and recover from scratch, using the backed up seed. Optional first step - check the validity of your seed: Dry-run recovery of Trezor One. Otherwise, wipe your Trezor, (under Advanced tab in Settings), then recover your seed. Since I have a Trezor One, I used the steps here:  https://wiki.trezor.io/User_manual:Advanced_Recovery.  It is a method of device recovery that guarantees your recovery seed cannot be revealed to hackers. Advanced Recovery doesn’t reveal any of your seed words to the computer, making it safer to use.  It also takes a while and you have to read tiny letters on your Trezor One. I squinted a lot.

14.	See if you get your money and transaction back. If you do, you can now use it with confidence because you know your backup/recovery process works and your backup mnemonic seed has been recorded correctly. You also know that you can execute the recovery correctly and the device works properly. (this was a suggestion I copied/pasted from another reddit post).

588,2021-02-28,"Lump Sum vs. DCA (Analysis) - TL;DR; - Lump Sum Wins (most of the time)No questions... just an analysis.  Trying to stir up some conversation.

With all the discussions on this topic, I analyzed BTC from 1/1/2016 to 1/1/2021.  I asked a very simple question:  Is it better to Lump Sum and hodl; or, take that same amount and DCA.

Method:  I pulled BTC ""adjusted close price” from Yahoo Finance on a weekly basis.  I assumed a fixed investment amount or that same amount purchased weekly from a starting point through 1/1/2021.

Example:  Is it better to invest $26,200 lump sum (day 1) or to DCA $100 per week for 262 weeks for a total investment of $26,200 (same as lump sum).

* Start Date:  1/1/2016
* End Date:  1/1/2021
* DCA Value Today:  $660,449
* Lump Sum Value Today: $2,631,165
* Conclusion:  Lump Sum > DCA (with this starting point).

Then I proceeded to analyze that same question for 261 starting periods (i.e. - 1/8/2016 - 1/1/2021, 1/15/2016 - 1/1/2021… 12/25/2020 - 1/1/2021.

Here are some of the results:

* Lump Sum Investing beat DCA 218 of 262 times (83% of the time)
* DCA beat Lump Sum investing by 30% in the periods where DCA outperformed Lump Sum
* Lump Sum beat DCA by 165% in the periods where Lump Sum beat DCA
* For the selected period, neither strategy “Lost Money” when hodl’d

The shaded area of the image reflects those investment periods where DCA beat out Lump Sum.

**My conclusion**

1. If history is any indicator, you have an 83% chance of making more with Lump Sum than DCA.
2. If history is any indicator, you will make money with either strategy (you will just make more with Lump Sum)
3. History isn’t a good indicator, but I really like spreadsheets.

**What will I do differently?** 

Nothing. Since I do not find boxes with $26K in them on a regular basis where I would have to choose between Lump Sum and DCA, I will continue to Lump Sum invest when I have a lump sum to invest.  

Otherwise, like most ""working stiffs"", I will make regularly scheduled investments that coincide with ""pay day"".",positive,0.9124607,282
589,2021-05-25,"Want to take a great chunk of my money out of stocks and put it into crypto but I have one potentially stupid question first...I feel like I'm missing out on discounted prices for the sole reason I'm scared to post in crypto subs because I see how hostile they can be to newbies but here goes...

How do you guys know, or at least what makes you guys so confident the government or the SEC or whoever won't just ban crypto? I mean I've learned enough about blockchain technology to know there's nothing that can do to stop that, but right now crypto is unregulated which basically makes it the wild west, and I like that. Will there be some measure of regulations someday? I would say that's almost inevitable, and that's ok. Regulations aren't cool but they don't scare me away. 

But what if you build up enough of a fortune to live off of and retire early, then you wake up one day and the government just bans the use of crypto? So they don't shut down the blockchain they just declare all crypto illegal to buy, sell or spend? So you can keep your crypto fortune, you just can't use it for anything. It's effectively monopoly money now.

And my question isn't even whether it's likely or not. Maybe this is very unlikely. The question is more what is there to prevent the government from doing this if they wanted to?

Anything? Nothing? Because if nothing why are thousands, if not millions of people so comfortable to go all in?

I ask because I want to be just as comfortable.

I am arguing currently with a guy at work. The following are his arguments. 

He insists that the reason so many institutions are buying up so much Bitcoin is so they can release it all at once and flood the market. Causing a massive drop in Bitcoin value. Essentially destroying Bitcoin. 

He says it’s impossible for Bitcoin to be a global currency because the big entities  like the US, the EU, Asia, and Russia will simply say no. Drop it and continue to print their own worthless money at whatever value they want. 

The US dollar will never be backed by Bitcoin or any other crypto because it then makes it so they can’t control/manipulate the currency. He’ says it’s not regulated and will be too easy for organizations like terror cells or drug cartels to move money and the governments of the world will destroy crypto before this is allowed to happen. I tried to argue how exactly do those organizations move money now? It’s not through crypto. It’s through cash. He says yeah, that cash is easily traceable unlike crypto.  

Another one of his talking points is they will never let fiat currency be backed by crypto because it would allow private billionaires and corporations to dictate the value of the crypto through manipulation. I tried to ask how that is different from now but he insists it’s because the USD is backed by a government and a country with a standing military. He says now the value is set by the govt and not the billionaire. 

He says that yes, Bitcoin is worth a lot right now because the guys that hold it and create it hype it and have to say it’s the future or it will lose all value once interest is lost. I am to new to this crypto world to have a logical or well thought out argument but it’s frustrating and makes me start doubting my faith in what I believe is the only logical next step in world currency.

619,2021-01-10,"Advice for beginner HODLersHi Everyone, hope all is well.

I have just established my HODLing career in crypto currency and wanted to share some steps I took to get started. One thing I quickly learned is that cryptocurrency is a MINEFIELD for newbies. There are so many ways we can get caught out and subject to eye-watering fees, scams and pitfalls.

I joined this game only 2 weeks ago due to FOMO as part of current surge in BTC value, so I'm still very much a newbie myself. Nevertheless, I've learned some valuable lessons. In many ways, ignorance is bliss.... as I will explain below.  I think there is a rollercoaster ride ahead of us but I'm a true believer that the endgame is to hold on to Bitcoin for dear life for the next 5-10 years. I believe it will be a valuable asset despite the immediate future being volatile and uncertain.

The first trick is to not overwhelm yourself. You only really need to know the basics; go on YouTube and watch a couple of ""summary"" videos on Satoshi's White Paper. It will summarise the key points of Bitcoin.  The other trick is to only bite off what you can chew. Binance exchange looks fun right? You want to trade crypto right? WRONG - leave it, don't bother, you DO NOT know what you are doing. It's unnecessary anxiety.

So if you want to HODL, here are my suggested steps:

1)You need a hardware wallet. Do not leave crypto in an online wallet, you are subject to theft and scams. Visit [https://trezor.io](https://trezor.io) and order your Trezor. It's a self-explanatory process once you're on the website. Trezor offers almost all services now. You can buy crypto direct from wallet at modest rates. I tried to buy crypto on various other platforms and it just overcomplicated things for me.

2) set up your hardware wallet when it arrives. It's dead easy. This isn't a how-to message for how to set up Trezor. Seriously, just follow the instructions when it arrives. 

3) Keep your Trezor recovery seeds somewhere safe. The recovery seeds are literally just a series of randomly generated words that you write down on a pice of paper. Key thing to remember is if you loose the recovery seeds, you will never see your crypto ever again. Keep them safe and out of harms way. Never disclose the location of your recovery seed. Never reveal it to anyone ever.

4) Buy crypto direct from Trezor wallet. I suggest using dollar-cost average approach, i.e. once a month, plug in your Trezor and buy as much crypto as you can afford to lose. Repeat this every month. For example, I log in after pay day every month and buy £50 worth of BTC. YouTube ""dollar cost average"" for more info - it's a cheap and low-risk model for HODLing.

5) Download an app called ""CoinGecko"" if you want to track the price of BTC and other crypto. It's a nice addition but not essential

6) If someone DMs you on Reddit, Telegram, Whastapp, or even drops you an email - DO NOT engage with them. Ever.

7) Trezor is currently developing a ""sell"" feature so we can exchange crypto to Fiat currency and send to bank account. The feature is not available yet. Since the endgame is to HODL for 5-10 years, don't bother trying to send crypto to an exchange and convert to fiat currency. It's honestly not worth it (my option only). I will just wait until Trezor have released this function in the wallet.

Hope this helps. I will probably get a lot of die-hard crypto maniacs picking holes in this approach.... but this is a subreddit for BEGINNERS. ;)

621,2021-02-18,"Explain why price wont nose dive after hitting key ATH levelsLong time lurker, first time poster. Am looking forward to hearing the communities thoughts on the following scenario.

Let's assume that the current trajectory continues upwards and BTC reaches 200-300kUSD or more by end of the year. For most early adopters who are holding BTC, this is a significant amount of money. And for anyone fortunate enough to be holding multiple coins, a life changing amount of money.  


In your opinion, if the price reaches those heights, what happens next? 

I foresee masses of holder selling off their BTC at the 100k, 200k, and 300k level. (Include Elon and the other whales here, wont they be eager to take a massive profit, if the price continues upwards?) If Im correct, wont this mean the price will nosedive quickly to a much, much lower price level?

626,2021-06-22,"Blockchain wallet got hacked and all my funds were stolenHello everyone. I want to share a horrible incident that happened a few days ago. I'm not an expert on cyber security and i know very little about hacking and stuff so i want you guys to fully read my post and give me an explanation. More importantly, i need advices and suggestions for future security. I'm gonna provide all the details in this post so that the experts can understand what really happened, how they got into my account and stole my assets with a clean transaction. This is gonna be a long post and i hope the experts will pay attention.
So I'm working as a freelancer and some of my regular clients use to pay via bitcoin. As this transaction method became a necessity for my business, i signed up for a Blockchain.com wallet in May 10th, 2021. I signed up with my Gmail account.

NOTE: The Gmail account i used to create the wallet had no 2FA enabled. I created the Gmail account recently and somehow forgot to enable the 2FA (probably the biggest mistake)

After creating the Blockchain wallet, I verified everything it wanted me to verify. I applied for gold level verification and got approved. These are the security options that i enabled in Blockchain-

Security center:
1. 2FA (Google authenticator on smartphone)
2. Written down the 12 recovery phrases on my personal diary

Advanced security center:
1. Remember two-step verification- Enabled
2. Login IP restrictions- Disabled
3. Wallet access via tor- Blocked

I downloaded the Blockchain wallet android app on my smartphone (Xiaomi Redmi Note 7) and logged in by scanning the pairing code. To log into my mobile app, i enabled biometric unlock. 

NOTE: I always used my wallet with my PC and smartphone only. I never tried to login with another device. I never used any antivirus software or VPN in both my PC and smartphone. I disabled windows defender for my PC also.

I could always access to my wallet from my phone using the biometric only. I rarely used my PC to log into my wallet and whenever i did, it would ask me to log into my Gmail account first with the same device and browser and authorize the log in. Then i would need to provide the the 2FA code from my Google authenticator app too. So i thought that my account is very much safe because in order to get access, one must log into my gmail account first and authorize the login and then he must have the authenticator code too which is on my smartphone only. So i started to receive payments. I always used my private wallet address to receive and send funds. The first month was good. I withdrew my funds first time in june 1st, 2021. Then i started to receive new payments in my account for the new month. I sold my Bitcoins and stored the balance in my USD wallet in Blockchain. Everything was going just fine until june 13th, 2021.

NOTE: I never shared my wallet ID, my password and my 12 recovery phrases to anyone. I repeat, no-one. My PC and my smartphone was accessable by me only. No one uses them not even my family. I never clicked on any type of links sent in my email. Never. But my password, wallet ID any 12 recovery phrases were written down on a secret notepad in a secret folder in my PC.

In June 13th, i had to send a small amount of BTC to an external wallet so i accessed my wallet with my phone and purchased the exact amount of BTC i had to send using my USD wallet balance. The Bitcoins were stored in my Trading wallet. I didn't transfer that to my private wallet instead i sent the BTC directly from my trading Wallet to my partner's external wallet. Then i noticed that my transaction is ""in review"". I didn't bother because there was no charge included (transactions from trading wallet don't require charges) so i thought it'll take time to be confirmed. After some moments when i tried to check my wallet again with my biometric, i saw that my account is not logged in anymore and it was saying ""Error decrypting wallet, password is incorrect"". I immediately went to my PC and tried to login. I had to log into my email address with the same browser first to authorize the login (there was no email for login attempt before that) and had to put the 2FA but still it was saying ""wrong password"". I freaked out totally and used my recovery phrases for the first time. I was told to change my email address and the password. I was given a new wallet ID with all my funds returned as bitcoins. I applied for my gold level verification again and it was approved. I made the same security settings, added a new 2FA code in my Google authenticator. The recovery phrases were same for the new ID. but my last transaction was still in review. So i contacted their support team via twitter and submitted a support ticket with the title ""Transaction in review"".

NOTE: The new email address that i added had no 2FA enabled either. (Another big mistake that i made). After this first incident, i faced the same problem several times. When i tried to access my wallet with my phone the same ""error decrypting wallet"" occurred. Then i had to use the recovery phrases again and again to regain access to my wallet. But it didn't tell me to change the email again. The wallet ID didn't change either like it did in the frist place. This ""error decrypting wallet"" occurred several times. I used to use hotspots from my partner's phone to check BTC prices sometimes so my partner said that it may happen because of using hotspots from other devices. So stopped connecting with other hotspots and the error didn't showed up again.

One of their support member named ""August"" supervised my issue. I had a support account also and i contacted them via that account. In June 15th, August asked me to clarify that did i change the email address recently and used the recovery phrases. He also told me that my id was accessed via different IP addresses and i need to specify the IP address and country from where i use my account. So i did provide valid information. In june 16th, 2021 i received an email from the support team saying that my fund is released. My Bitcoins were in my account and my previous transaction was confirmed also. Everything became normal again but that didn't last long.

In June 18th, i woke up in the morning and logged into my wallet via phone (biometric login). It logged in perfectly. No password issues, nothing. But all my Bitcoins were gone! I checked my activity panel and found a transaction that was made to an external wallet just 2 hours ago while i was sleeping! The transaction was confirmed. I quickly ran to my computer and tried to login via computer. I had to authorize the login from my email (It was the first login attempt email in 18th june) and provide the authenticator code from my phone. Everything was clean! But how can someone just entered my account and sent all my Bitcoins to another account while i was sleeping! I lost all my money like that! I know I'll never gonna get that back, it's gone for good and I'm trying to move on. But i need to know why and how exactly did it happen?
I made some assumptions but I'm not sure about anything
1. Maybe my email was hacked (as it didn't have any 2FA, it might have been easy) and the hacker got access to my wallet, authorized the login for his device from my email account and stole my assets. Is this possible?
2. Maybe my PC was hacked and the hacker used my PC to do the work. But i computer was shut down. And still he will need the 2FA code from the Google authenticator app in my smartphone. Let's assume that he hacked my PC and somehow found the 12 recovery phrases. Then why my password wasn't changed! He could have change the password with those phrases. Is this possible?
3. Maybe my smartphone is hacked. In that case he can get into my wallet from the blockchain app. Probably figured out the pin code as the alternative for the biometric. Is this possible?

NOTE: i did gave my wallet ID and IP address to the official support team. They wanted the information. I heard that it is possible to hack an entire device just by using the IP address.

Actually this could be anything so i need an expert to analyse this matter and give me his best guess about how it all happened and i need an expert to advise me on this matter. I'm not trying to get my money back cause i know it's long gone. I just wanna make sure that my accounts are 100% secure for future. And what measures should take to completely secure my devices. I have already made a clean windows set-up on my PC and I'll perform factory reset on my smartphone. I have changed my IP address also. I know the best solution is a hardware wallet but don't have the budget for one right now because I'm trying to get an iPhone first. The Xiaomi phones are not good for privacy as i heard. I'm also planning on buying a YubiKey security key for my future blockchain and coinbase accounts. I hope I'll get valuable suggestions from the experts on this community.

630,2021-04-19,"Bitcoin Question - what happens when BTC is no longer mined?Hi all,

As with so many others these days, I’ve been trying to get up to speed on Bitcoin. When I look at new financial products, I tend to try to poke holes in them as a way to better understand potential risks.

I now have two questions I’m putting out there to get people’s feedback on.  I’m sure people much smarter than me have already posed and addressed this, but I haven’t really seen it yet.  Note I cross posted this on the /bitcoin forum too.

I will first pose the questions here, and then dive into my assumptions and thought process (sorry, it's a long post):

**The questions are:**  What level do BTC transaction fees need to be to support the physical infrastructure required to process and maintain the BTC blockchain once new BTC cannot be mined?  And will that equilibrium transaction fee render BTC completely impractical and lead a breakdown to the entire blockchain?

I’ll start with some baseline assumption/stats, all taken from bitinfocharts ([https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/](https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/))

1. Miners are currently paid 6.25 BTC  per block mined (US$375,000 @ 1BTC=$60,000)
2. Bitcoin mining rewards reduced by 50% roughly every four years at current rates (last time May 2020)
3. Transaction Fee rewards are around 1.49 BTC ($89,400 @ 1BTC=$60,000)
4. Fee as portion of total processing reward: 17.9%
5. Average transaction fee for a Bitcoin transaction is currently .00063 BTC ($37.80 @ 1BTC=$60,000)

Based on those facts, I calculated the following (pretty basic but bear with me):

1. Total Reward for processing a bitcoin block: roughly $464,400
2. Means there are on average 2,365 transactions/block (=total transaction fee / average transaction fee)

So let’s fast forward to the time when all of the Bitcoin that can be created have been mined. At this point, the Bitcoin network must be supported solely by transaction fees.

Assuming *current* transaction levels and BTC price remain the same, but miners no longer earn rewards for mining bitcoins and only get paid via transaction fees, then total transaction fees per block must equal $464,400 (=current value of mined BTC + value of transaction fees per block)

That equals $196 per bitcoin transaction (total transaction fee / average transactions per block). That’s based on current transaction levels and BTC price.

This transaction fee seems pretty high to me, when compared to alternatives. And this assumes the current level of transactions on the bitcoin blockchain.

If I think about current Bitcoin trends, then I assume, going forward:

· The number of bitcoin transactions will increase over time as adoption grows.

· The value of BTC will increase over time as adoption grows.· Increased BTC values results in increased processing time.

So, BTC blocks will become harder to process and there will be more transactions to process, requiring investment into new processing hardware to maintain blockchain performance. This hardware will need to be paid for.

The questions, again:  What level do BTC transaction fees need to be to support the physical infrastructure required to process and maintain the BTC blockchain? And will that equilibrium transaction fee render BTC completely impractical and lead a breakdown to the entire blockchain?

I see a few potential scenarios here once mining new BTC stops:

Scenario 1: Transaction fee are not high enough to support most miners, thereby reducing the number of miners until you introduce the real risk of a 51% attack.

Scenario 2: Transaction fees inflate hugely as no miners will agree to process transactions unless the fee covers their operating costs and some profit. The increase in fees results in BTC becoming too costly to use.

Why am I wrong?

Thanks for reading this far. I may have rambled a bit toward the end. In any case I am interested in hearing answers to my questions and critics of my arguments.

&#x200B;

Other notes/points:

One counterargument I have heard regarding high BTC transaction costs is the you can use Layer 2 solutions to reduce transaction fees. What I have seen is that the Layer 2 solutions DECREASE the number of actual BTC block transactions (there are lots of transactions on the Layer 2 level, but only one opening and one closing transaction on the blockchain). Also, as an aside, to me the Layer 2 solutions invalidate the basic purpose of bitcoin, namely anonymous transactions and no financial middlemen (since low transaction fees have already been proven to be false).

So instead of a large pool of miners competing over a large number of transactions, there will be fewer and fewer transactions to compete over, and less transactions to earn fees on, increasing the competition to process the remaining transactions and thereby driving down transaction costs.

However, if BTC can no longer be mined, and the only reward is the transaction fee, there could be a situation where transaction fees are not high enough or transactions not frequent enough for less efficient miners to cover the cost of processing the blockchain. This will result in those inefficient miners dropping out of the mining population.

So fewer transactions on the actual blockchain due to Layer 2 solutions, plus transaction fees being the only way to get paid results in a hypercompetitive “winner takes all” market where only the most efficient and most competitive miners will survive.

&#x200B;

Edit (20 Apr 2021)

Thank you everyone for your comments.  Lots of arguments made about how miners will always get paid or will always profit due to various reasons.  I'd like to respond to this point:

Currently, I get how miners can make a profit.  They know that if they processing transactions, they will earn a brand new bitcoin.  This dynamic changes once all bitcoins are mined.  Revenue for miners no longer comes from new bitcoin, but from transaction fees.  People need to pay transactions fees, and if they no longer want to pay transaction fees then they do not.  Miners become reliant on market forces of transaction fees and competitors.  This is a completely different economic dynamic than just mining from brand new bitcoins.  If there is any sort of competitor in the next 120 years that is able to provide the benefits of bitcoin at lower transaction fees, the entire system collapses since miners will have no revenue (since people wishing to make financial transactions will go to the lowest cost competitor).

Secondly, Bitcoin is a commodity good.  What I mean by commodity is that each bitcoin is identical to every other bitcoin.  In commodity markets, the lowest cost producer always ""wins.""  Regardless of how efficient technology becomes, someone will implement it better than everyone else, and will therefore be able to process transactions more cheaply.  In the long run, this will drive all other miners out of business, resulting in the risk of a 51% attack.

You already see this dynamic playing out with something like 75% of all new bitcoins being mined in China.  This is the case because you can mine more cheaply in China due to electrical costs.

If I put my conspiracy hat on, which I rarely do, I might say that the bitcoin blockchain is already at risk of a 51% attach due to the concentration of mining activity in China.   You may not be aware but every single company in China MUST, BY LAW, take direction from the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and larger company are required to have CCP staff on their management team or board.  Can you imagine a situation where the CCP directs Chinese miners to falsify the blockchain in order to disrupt the worldwide financial system, or at least cause some mayhem, once bitcoin is more widely adopted?

633,2021-05-16,"I want to understand Bitcoin basics (the economy, not the currency)Hi everyone,

There's two things I'd like to be sure about regarding the bitcoin economy. I have presented my understanding of the topic, and then posed the questions.

**Question A**

There are two types of people in the Bitcoin network. *Type 1* are the more regular ones, who can send and receive transactions and also have access to the ledger with all validated transactions in the network. Type 2 are miners - they too can do everything that *Type 1* people can, but they will have access to pending transactions for their computers to verify (and thereby mine bitcoin).

Question: Am in right here? Or does **e\*\*\*\*veryone have access to the pending transactions** which they can verify but only those with the computing power will actually be able to mine?

**Question B**

This one is a bit more complex. I am trying to understand the mining process from the perspective of someone who does it.

This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BODyqM-V71E&t=124s) was really helpful: From 1:40 to 3:00, he says that mining computers have to solve a problem, then the mining program puts a list of pending transactions in a block, and that this block is sent to all the nodes in the network so that **other computers** can validate it. Other computers that validate the solution sent along with that block will update with its copy of the transaction ledger with the transaction that were in this block.

However, I found the below text in this.

*A transaction’s lifecycle starts with the transaction’s creation, also known as origination. The transaction is then signed with one or more signatures indicating the authorization to spend the funds referenced by the transaction.* ***The transaction is then broadcast on the bitcoin network, where each network node (participant) validates and propagates the transaction until it reaches (almost) every node in the network. Finally, the transaction is verified by a mining node and included in a block of transactions that is recorded on the blockchain.***

*Once recorded on the blockchain and confirmed by sufficient subsequent blocks (confirmations), the transaction is a permanent part of the bitcoin ledger and is accepted as valid by all participants. The funds allocated to a new owner by the transaction can then be spent in a new transaction, extending the chain of ownership and beginning the lifecycle of a transaction again.*

In contrast to the video, this one says that each network node (participant) validates and the transaction and it's THEN verified through mining node.

**Question:** Am I right in assuming that every computer in the network (or at least minimum number of computers) will validate a given transaction - but then afterwards, a mining computer is needed to solve the equation, 'tag' that block with a unique ID or something, and then this mining computers solution is validated by other mining computers, which will then make this block a permanent part of the block chain?

If my understanding is completely fucking wrong, could you please explain the mining process from the perspective of someone with a mining computer? E.g. Firstly, there are a set of pending transactions in a block, there is a hash that needs to be solved by your computer to tag that block with uniquely, it is then sent to...

I have .10943357 of a bit coin at a average cost of 68k
With a equity of 7.8k

Is this enough or should I keep putting money in?

I didn't buy when it was at 20k-42k

So I bought it at 72k before it climbs even higher.

But I don't want to put too much incase it dips back down and my money is on hold for who knows how long until it climbs back up.


Any advice or tips? I'm totally new and never done anything like this before.


Even words of encouragement would be helpful 

Edit:
I wasn't expecting so many replies. I'll try to reply to everyone but might take a while. 

Just some extra context. My main reason for doing a FOMO (I had to look it up ) was because I was spending too much money on wants. I was saving up for a car but kept using the money. So I decided to put it somewhere I couldn't really touch it, BTC. I have about 2k $ in stocks such as Disney, Delta, Meta. But they weren't really doing much so I just sold it and put it in BTC.

I had previously bought btc at 27k and sold it at 28k and thought I made good profit. 

I am ready to lose all of my money. And even then I would put more money in. I am willing to go broke and on a tight budget to support the long ride. 

For those of you who mentioned DCA. I never knew or heard of it before. I will definitely start investing DCA way.

I waited for it to dip once and ended up buying the majority of my bitcoin at 72k.

Long story short.
I plan on investing more(DCA)
I am prepared for the correction and if it happens then that means I lost the key to the safe and will remain untouched until I'm in the profits again.

1. It seems to me that the 12 or 24 word seed phrase is the most important part of the puzzle. Lose i and you lose everything. Lost your hard wallet, then whatevs, buy another one and restore your keys with your seed.

So wouldn't the safest thing be to buy the cheapest HW wallet, generate the seed and create your keys, and then just destroy the wallet? 

I think the answer to that is ""then you cannot add to your wallet"". Buy couldn;t you just use your own public key to deposit? What am I missing?

2. So why even have a hard wallet? Why can't there be a safe, cheap, efficient way to generate a seed phrase and keys without a $100 purchase?

3. Can you create a software wallet from the seed phrase you create from your HW wallet?

It goes without saying that this is barrier to entry. I remember how scared shitless I was when I created paper wallets for my 11 or so BTC back in the day.

When monolithic mining pools in Asia dominate the mining economy? When people who can afford to buy the most bitcoin now are still the billionaires and big banks? 

I like the idea underlying bitcoin, but it’s revolutionary must not be as idealistic as originally hoped for, if bitcoin is mostly going to mirror the massive concentrations of wealth and power that already exist. The ones who benefitted the most were the early adopters. 

It looks like bitcoin may turn into something that is mostly a protest against inflationary monetary policy by being a deflationary asset. It will still be the major corporations and governments of the world who will be running their economies in tandem with the bitcoin economy.

But after asking these questions and reading the responses, it really seems to me like just having a safe in your house with a bunch of cash in it would be far more useful in such a situation than having an equivalent amount of Bitcoin.

However, while you can sell your Bitcoin for example in GBP, you can't just transfer that GBP directly to your bank as you could with other traditional investments, it instead gets held in your exchange portfolio at that currency.

From what I've understood you need to have a separate ""wallet"" for cryptocurrencies which come in digital and physical forms. They... Contain some kind of addresses, and these addresses are used to transfer BTC from an exchange to a wallet for safekeeping? Since a digital wallet could get hacked, people prefer to store their transaction keys/addresses in a physical item that you can plug to your computer and manage it via there somehow. But if your Bitcoin is in a hard wallet, can you still buy more of it or sell it? Does a Trezor wallet communicate with Coinbase for example? I can visualise how you put money into Bitcoin, but how to actually then sell it and turn it into fiat currency in your bank account, that is lost on me.

I am relative new to crypto, I started back in November. I have made gains that I never expected in such a short time. It got me thinking when will I take my profits. For what do I take the profits?

This were scenarios I was thinking to take profits and I dont know which is best to achieve my goals.

1. Sell everything and buy back in the bear market.. but that got me thinking of I probably don't get it so cheap as I bought it...

2. Sell 50% and hold the rest and use a little profit to buy myself back later.

3. Hodl everything and wait until the prices are going parabolic and what is enough because greedy feeling is coming when you stay waiting. The hard part is when is this if everybody would time the market we would be millionaires.

Binance - Registered with my phone number which in my country is registered to me personally. To purchase BN I needed to provide my full name and address in order to use my bank card. Apple Pay did not work. I needed a full ID to trade ‘properly’.

Coinbase - Similar to above but needed actual photos of ID.

Exodus - Appears anonymous as I don’t recall providing information to install the wallet app. Now I could receive crypto and I guess it would be anonymous. However I don’t like it not being open source as it means I have to trust these guys to not somehow have a backdoor into the wallet, right? Buying Bitcoin via Apple Pay in app also didn’t work.

Are there trustworthy exchanges that allow anonymous trading? Are there ways to trade directly from your wallet or do you always have to keep some money in an exchange and then transfer in and out?

EDIT: Some of you have questioned my motivation for anonymity and linked it to taxes. That’s interesting to me as I’d never considered taxes. It must come up a lot when trading higher values and is something I’ll look into now.

Not being anonymous means that there are inherent privacy risks and now I need to consider them and accept them. For example I need to trust the exchange with my personal ID information.

747,2021-06-06,"Wouldn't Bitcoin mining stop someday?Hi! I recently was thinking about this:

Now  people mine and verify the transactions of the Bitcoin network because  of the prize that the network gives them. And as long as Bitcoin amount  is limited, the prize that the network gives to the miners is decreasing  logarithmically (Is this even a word? XD).  So my concern is this:  Wouldn't people stop mining bitcoin and using so much resources when  Bitcoin network stops giving prizes to miners or it gives a very very  little amount of money?

I'm thinking of buying my first (fraction of a) Bitcoin. I'm thinking of investing $500, and then slowing ramp up.

Here's what I plan to do, please can you tell me if this looks good or am I doing something wrong?

   1. Open an account with Coinbase Pro

It costs between $200-$300 to get all the equipment and set it up with Umbrel (and less if you already have some of the hardware required).   The tech set up took <2 hours, and the sync only 2 days.

1. To support the decentralized Bitcoin [network](https://bitnodes.io/)
2. Increase my privacy (my wallet connects to my node)
3. Confirm my transactions directly with my node (removing my need to trust 3rd parties to verify)
4. Offers me the ability to manage my own [multisig](https://coinguides.org/multisig-multi-signature-wallet/) set up for added security
5. I can open a [Lightning](https://www.blockchain-council.org/blockchain/a-quick-guide-on-lightning-network/) node if/when I decide to do so

With the wallet on the way, I then went looking for an exchange, so I'd be ready to go when it arrived. This is when I started to rethink investing. 

Every single exchange I've researched has a ton of problems: Several days/weeks/months for verification. 
Bank transfers that don't show up.
Frozen accounts. 
People not being able to withdraw their coin/earnings. 
Unhelpful customer service for days/weeks on end.
Exchanges being hacked, which is especially worrisome when many seem to have trouble getting their assests of the site.

After 3 days of headaches, researching all the exchanges, I have not found one yet without a plethora of problems. This makes me question if Bitcoin is a wise investment.
 I can't picture many people being willing to go through all this research, headaches, and being willing to trust their money with these exchanges. I therefore have my doubts that a big influx of people will actually go through with adopting Bitcoin.

804,2021-08-15,"Appreciating everyone who helped lay down the groundwork for Satoshi Nakamoto to create BitcoinBefore **Hal Finney** passed away, he written one final (and very sad) post called [Bitcoin and Me.](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=155054.0) **Hal** said:

>Fast forward to late 2008 and the announcement of Bitcoin I've noticed that cryptographic graybeards (I was in my mid 50's) tend to get cynical. I was more idealistic; I have always loved crypto, the mystery and the paradox of it. When Satoshi announced Bitcoin on the cryptography mailing list, he got a skeptical reception at best. Cryptographers have seen too many grand schemes by clueless noobs. They tend to have a knee jerk reaction.

I don't blame them for being skeptical. The Cypherpunks had been trying to build a decentralized payment network for about 20 years and kept failing. They were losing faith as they were growing old and grey.

Anyways, I thought I'd make a thread crediting and sourcing all of those who contributed to building Bitcoin. I think sometimes Satoshi unfairly gets too much credit, there were dozens of people who came before him who laid down the academic ground work, he just was the one who was finally able to put all the pieces together.

Let me know if there's any key papers I'm missing. Starting from the beginning:

&#x200B;

* In 1974, **Ralph C. Merkle**  published a paper called ""*Secure Communications Over Insecure Channels*"",  which invented public-key cryptography. [You can read the paper here.](https://www.merkle.com/1974/PuzzlesAsPublished.pdf)
* In 1977,  **Ron Rivest**, **Adi Shamir**, and **Leonard Adleman** published a paper called ""*A Method for Obtaining Digital Signatures and Public-Key Cryptosystems*"", inventing the world's first digital encryption standard, called **RSA** (based on their initials). [You can read their paper here.](https://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/Rsapaper.pdf)   **RSA** is an algorithm used by computers to encrypt and decrypt messages using a public key and a private key.
* In 1978, **Ralph C. Merkle** published a paper called ""*Protocols for public key cryptosystems*"".  [You can read the paper here.](http://www.merkle.com/papers/Protocols.pdf) **Ralph** proposes different methods to create protocol networks using public-key cryptography.
* In 1981, **David Chaum** published a paper called ""*Untraceable Electronic Mail, Return Addresses, and Digital Pseudonyms*""  [You can read it here.](https://chaum.com/publications/chaum-mix.pdf) **David** essentially lays out some mathematical proofs for encrypted anonymous messages between two parties.
* In 1982,   **Leslie Lamport** published a paper called ""*Byzantine Generals Problem*"". [You can read it here.](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/pubs/byz.pdf) The Byzantine Generals Problem describes a condition of a computer system where components may fail and there is imperfect information on whether a component has failed. This academic paper paved the way for consensus algorithms in distributed ledgers.
* In 1982, **David Chaum** published another paper called ""*Blind signatures for untraceable payments* "" [You can read it here.](http://www.hit.bme.hu/~buttyan/courses/BMEVIHIM219/2009/Chaum.BlindSigForPayment.1982.PDF) It essentially lays down a mathematical concept, that is somewhat similar to what's used in Bitcoin wallets.
* In 1987, **Ralph C. Merkle** published a paper called ""*One Way Hash Functions and DES*"", where he invents  *cryptographic hashes*. [You can read it here.](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/0-387-34805-0_40.pdf)   *Cryptographic hashes* are used to verify the authenticity of a piece of data. They are a one-way function, which is practically infeasible to invert or reverse the computation.
* In 1988, **David Chaum** published another paper called  ""*Untraceable Electronic Cash*"". [You can read it here.](https://www.chaum.com/publications/Untraceable_Electronic_Cash.pdf) He proposes the idea of electronic anonymous payment channels.
* In 1990, **David Chaum** announced the start of *eCash*, a project from his company *DigiCash* that allows anonymous payments though his internet network. Development continued into the late 90s and **David** received a lot of investor funding, however, like most 90s internet companies, the project flopped and he filed for bankruptcy. You could call *eCash* the world's first VC cryptocurrency.
* In 1991, **Stuart Haber** and **W. Scott Stornetta** published a paper on a concept of a cryptographically secured chain of blocks whereby no one could tamper with timestamps of documents. [You can read their paper here.](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=B2B303D1152CC7D1B9FEEE445FAFDAF2?doi=10.1.1.46.8740&rep=rep1&type=pdf) While they didn't call it ""blockchain"", they essentially invented the core concept that Satoshi  ended up expanding upon.
* In 1992, **Hal Finney** had been invited to a mailing list of San Francisco tech enthusiasts, which would later be known as **Cypherpunks**. He sends an email to the group referencing **David Chaum**'s 1981 paper and wants to figure out how to apply it to build a decentralized, private, and permissionless internet. [You can read his email ](https://cypherpunks.venona.com/date/1992/11/msg00108.html)[to the Cypherpunk mailing list here](https://cypherpunks.venona.com/date/1992/11/msg00108.html). Hal Finney's email essentially kickstarted the **Cypherpunks**' mission to build bitcoin.
* In 1993, **Cynthia Dwork** and **Moni Naor** published  ""*Pricing via Processing or Combatting Junk Mail*"" [You can read their paper here.](http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~naor/PAPERS/pvp.pdf)  They found a way to deter denial-of-service attacks and other service abuses such as spam on a network by requiring some work from a service requester, usually meaning processing time by a computer.  They are often credited for creating the mathematical proofs behind **Proof of Work**.
* In 1993, **Hal Finney** sent an email exposing the double spending flaw in **David Chuam**'s 1988 paper, and brainstorms of ideas to fix it. [Read his email to the Cypherpunk Mailing list here. ](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/detecting-double-spending/)
* In 1993, **Eric Hughes** penned the ""***Cypherpunk*** *Manifesto*"". [You can read it here.](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/static/docs/cypherpunk-manifesto.txt)  **Eric Hughes** outlined his opinion on the core principals of being a **Cypherpunk**, which he believed were people who built software to create a private, decentralized internet. He believed that privacy in the digital age is a human right and **Cypherpunks** must fight to protect that at all costs.
* In 1993, **Hal Finney** proposed the concept of what would become the modern NFT. [You can read the email to the Cypherpunk mailing list here.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EtVhjozXcAUoTsK?format=jpg&name=large)  He suggested using the cryptographic proof not just to cash, but also  to validate digital collectables like baseball cards.
* In 1994, **Hal Finney** proposed a decentralized *remailing* network that pays people for performing the work necessary to keep the network running. [You can read his email to the Cypherpunk mailing list here](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/for-pay-remailers/).
* In 1997, **Nick Szabo** published a paper called ""*The Idea of* ***Smart Contracts***"". [You can read it here.](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/the-idea-of-smart-contracts/) In his paper he coins the term **Smart Contracts,** which he says code can become legal law by enforcing social contracts through immutable code.
* In 1997, **Adam Back** invented the **Proof of Work** consensus algorithm that was used in *Hashcash*, which was a program designed to fight email spam and DDoS attacks. Before sending  an email, a *Hashcash* user would need to generate a hash (a seemingly random string of numbers) using parts of the email and some extra data, and send this hash along with the email to the recipient. The recipient would only accept the email if it included a “valid” hash, otherwise the email would bounce. The trick was that only a subset of potential hashes based on the email would be considered valid. This meant that users had to spend some computing power--essentially, energy--to generate *Hashcash*. 5 years later, **Adam Back** published a retrospective paper on Hashcash. [You can read it here.](http://www.hashcash.org/papers/hashcash.pdf)
* In 1998, **Nick Szabo** proposed a digital payment Network called ""*Bit Gold*"". *Bit Gold* would use the concepts of **David Chaum**, **Stuart Haber** and **W. Scott Stornetta**, and **Adam Back** into a single decentralized digital payment network. On a technical level, **Nick Szabo** envisioned many of the core concepts that Bitcoin later implemented, but he didn't build a working product, largely because he couldn't overcome the double spending problem in an effective way.
* In 1998, **Wei Dai** published a paper called ""*B Money*"", which was a concept of a decentralized digital payment network using a distributed ledger. While he provided no code or product, he essentially described in words exactly what Bitcoin became to be 10 years later on a philosophical level.  [You can read his paper here.](http://www.weidai.com/bmoney.txt)
* In 2002, **John R. Douceur** published the paper ""*The* ***Sybil Attack***"". [You can read the paper here.](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/static/docs/the-sybil-attack.pdf) **John** coins the term: **Sybil Attack,** which he defines as bad actors who exploit the game theory of a decentralized network by creating and using multiple identities  to spam the network. **John** states that networks without a logically centralized authority will inherently always be vulnerable to **Sybil Attacks,** but there are ways to alter game theory to minimize it.
* In 2004, **Hal Finney** invented ***Reusable Proof of Work*** *(****RPoW****)*. [You can read his email to the Cypherpunk mailing list here. l](https://cryptome.org/rpow.htm)  Reusable proof of work resolved the double spending issue by  permitting the random exchange of tokens without repeating the work required to generate them. After someone had ""spent"" a PoW token at a website, the website's operator could exchange that ""spent"" PoW token for a new, unspent **RPoW** token, which could then be spent at some third-party website similarly equipped to accept **RPoW** tokens. While Bitcoin did not use **RPoW**, **Hal Finney** was the first to come up with a working solution to the double spending problem.",positive,0.7624249,120

813,2021-02-09,"Beginners' Mistakes (Don't be like me)Thought I'd grace this sub with a few observations I have made along the way. Keep in mind that I am a beginner myself, but perhaps a few steps ahead of a complete newcomer, so I hope I can help someone avoid some basic mistakes. I am not advising you to buy or to sell (I personally am a hodler). This is not investment advice, just some things to consider if you do decide to buy. This is mostly for people using the big exchanges.

1) Don't fund your account with a credit card. I know, it's tempting. Your first time buying, you want to have your BTC instantly. The fees are just not worth it. It's much better to fund your exchange account with a small amount via bank transfer repeatedly. That's how you stay disciplined with your DCA, if that is what you are going for. Fund account, DCA until you start running short, fund again.

2) Always make limit orders. I personally use Kraken but my understanding is this applies to other exchanges too. Whenever you use the ""instant buy"" option or execute a market order, you actually get a significantly worse exchange rate. I assumed I would simply get the market price–not so. In fact, the rate you get when buying this way can be hundreds of USD higher. This also applies when selling, just in the opposite direction.

3) Don't even think about day trading. Unless you have experience from other fields, it's just not worth it. Even then I would advise against it. Most people lose money daytrading. It sucks up your attention, wrecks your nerves and usually results in a loss anyway. Hodl is the way.

4) Expect outages. I take them as hodl protection. Every time there is a large pump, the exchanges tend to crash. Even if I am temted to sell, I can't. If you do want to sell, perhaps keep some of your BTC on the exchange at all times to make it easier, although I would strongly advise you not to, since not your keys not your coins.

5) Avoid shitcoins. If you want to diversify into some of the bigger alts that can be okay. But there's always pump and dump shenanigans going on and honestly it's best to just stay away. You might get lucky, but chances are you won't. D\*gecoin's rise is an exception, pump and dumps usually don't become a huge thing.

6) Don't just take reddit predictions at face value. Everytime i go on r/Bitcoin, there's ten people predicting a pump and ten others predicting a dump. Just because they sound certain don't mean they're right. I believe the price will keep following the 4 year cycle and I believe it will keep climbing up over the long run. Yes, there are useful indicators out there but ultimately, nobody knows. We are in turbulent times and with institutional adoption, this cycle really does seem to be different. So who knows. Do your own research and don't make hasty decisions. It's your own money and it's up to you how much risk you are willing to tolerate.

7) If you're a hodler, don't check the price too often. If you're on a DCA plan, you really don't have to. Just set a time and buy at that time. The price doesn't affect you in the short term, if you're in for the long term.

There's much more I could put here, but this isn't meant to be comprehensive. It's just a few things I have encountered and/or experienced and learned from.",positive,0.7938919,117

However, one thing that doesn’t sit very well with me is all the people that advocate for bitcoin and say it’s the next crypto which at some point will replace fiat - and then look at the coin as a short-term or long-term “investment” praying that the 10k they “invested” turns into 40k, or more (you get my point). 

These people are such strong advocates but ironically only use the coin as an investment feature, and this is very prominent in almost all of the communities I’ve visited. They essentially cash in almost fully into the coin to then cash out immediately when they turn huge profits, what’s the point of bitcoin then? 

My question is chalked up to this: how can people say it’s the next currency when they don’t even use it as one? How does this help the cause at all if you’re not even using it for the sole purpose it was designed for?

Am I missing something?

&#x200B;

So with that in mind, I'm hoping someone can clarify a few things for me. Before I ask my questions, just know I have no ""pride of authorship"" here - if I'm wrong or am misunderstanding something I figure ""BitcoinBegginners"" is the place where I can sound like a complete idiot, then learn the right answers and not feel \*too\* bad for, you know, sounding like a idiot lol. 

&#x200B;

So let's start with I'll start with what I understand Bitcoin actually is... 

&#x200B;

I. What is Bitcoin (BTC)

I've spend the last, let's say 2 weeks reading up on BTC. From what I can tell: 

1. BTC is a non-fiat currency which has no intrinsic or practical value (except to the blockchain database itself). 
2. BTC is currently (for now) distributed as a ""reward"" to certain contributors (miners) who help maintain the integrity / accuracy of the blockchain database. 
3. BTC can also be acquired through more ""traditional"" means (you can buy it with USD) but is pretty much exchangeable for practically anything (determined by buyer/seller).

In essence - BTC \*itself\* is completely worthless (it's not backed by any government or by any commodity) and it's valuation is tied \*exclusively\* to usefulness as a secure means of tracking exchanges within the Blockchain database.  I mean, I'll give it to BTC that the security of exchange, if it works, has a value but the idea of getting tokens from your computer as a reward for... keeping track of all the tokens... I guess that's one way to run an economy? I'm no money scientist but that raises some more questions - but I'll get to those later.

But first, do I have everything here in section above correct? Am I missing something? I'm being critical of BTC here which perhaps is a bit unfair - BTC has been around for awhile but it's still relatively new. I'm just trying to make sure I have the concept correct. I'll move on to the blockchain.

&#x200B;

II.  What is Blockchain?

So again, in my scholarly research of an entire 2 weeks of doing on again off again reading... I found that basically Blockchain, also known as the Blockchain database, also known as the public ledger, is just that - a decentralized ledger that everyone uses to keep track of transactions. You know, when I first read that I thought it was a really neat idea. The invention of the \*double\* entry ledger was ***revolutionary*** to accounting when it was invented, and essentially the blockchain system (software) is a pretty damn nifty way to take the next step forward to a \*TRIPLE\* entry ledger system. 

So again, if I have this right - BTC and the blockchain database actually work with each other to make transactions more secure AND to ensure the records of those transactions are accurate - I mean that's a pretty neat idea.

&#x200B;

III. Conclusion

  
First I'd like to know if I have items I. and II. correct. Do I? If you were to ELI5, I mean really dumb it down, aren't these the basics? 

If so, there is an old saying, ""when everyone's in charge, no one's in charge"". 

It just seems to me from the basics of how BTC and Blockchain technology work together that there are some pretty big vulnerabilities in the system.  Whoever came up with the idea is a genius, but it blows my mind that they left out things like:

1. Updates / changes to the Blockchain software are determined by a VOTE between all users and whoever invented BTC didn't have the foresight to ask themselves what if bad actors or even well intentioned actors (like governments) influence those votes. I don't know if it is still the case, but the I've read several studies that show China controls an estimated 75% of the nodes (votes) in the BTC network... 
2. Mining Pools. I mean really? Seriously? Capitalism 101 - separate the worker from the means of production. Investopedia basically says *individual* mining for BTC is practically useless. So giant mining pools form... almost like a bank or a business (or scary thought BOTH). Who's regulating these mining pools? Wouldn't the mining pools also have a concentration of voting power? Don't mining pools have a conflict of interest or at the very least strong financial incentives to keep a disproportionate amount of mined BTC profits for themselves?
3. Who is in charge of reliability, updates and fixes to the blockchain software? I read that there is a group out of MIT that is doing most of the work, and yes I also read that there is this process called BIP that all proposed changes must go through. BUT I also read that \*anyone\* in the BTC network can propose changes, and well ... if someone who owns a mining pool, say... a large corrupt government... proposed a change which completely screws everyone else over so they can profit... ... ...  or what happens if an update is pushed out and it causes problems? WHO is going to remedy the damages? If a bank get's robbed in the US my money is insured, I will lose zero sleep over it. If a Blockchain software update causes an error and I lose my BTC because of a ""glitch"" WHO is liable? Do I sue the entire BTC network? The guys and gals at MIT? If anyone knows I am genuinely curious. 

&#x200B;

Alright, my name is Dave thanks for coming to my TED talk lol. I hope I don't come across as sounding like an arrogant a\*hole lol - just these are my concerns from the research I've done. I still think the concept is genius - I could see blockchain technology revolutionizing the global economy and even the way we do business. Just as an investment I'm curious to know what the community has to say before I move any of my USD into BTC lol. As someone very wise in the ways of business/investment (who probably got screwed over) once said ***Caviate Emptor***  

&#x200B;

Looking forward to learning more from the community, I mean who knows, seems like crypto is the right track for the next stage of the economy.",positive,0.87969935,106
861,2021-05-09,"Questions about safely holding BTCMy knowledge of investing basically sums up to - buy low, sell high = profit, buy high - sell low = loss. So I am not much of an experienced investor. I am a software engineer so I do understand concepts around crypto to a certain level that I understand the risk.

Around a month ago, I've joined Coinbase and decided to try DCA, as I am not prepared for a lump-sump without knowing more about this. I am currently having recurring buys each Sunday (30$ BTC)

My questions are:

\- If I bought low positions through DCA a week ago, and now transfer my BTCs to a wallet - do I still hold these low positions?

\- How often should I keep my BTCs in Coinbase, Software Wallet, and Hardware wallet? Should I buy through Coinbase, and immediately transfer it to a wallet?

\- How do I know that I 100% own my BTCs and not use Coinbase as a bank or something similar?

\- Is it possible to do DCA without using a middleman? Just immediately doing it through a Hardware wallet for example?

A) only the CEO, or only the CFO?
The problem i see with only one person, is that you rely on one person, that can change jobs, die, Take the money and run before you know it, etc

B) both the CEO and the CFO
More or less the same situation, one could just take the money and transfer it to another address, and there would not be a way of identifying who did it

C) three or more people
It gets even more nasty. Not even need to take the money and run, just take the money and no one would know who actually did it

D) custodial service

I understand China is obviously a massive part of the global economy, so I definitely get that negative moves they make would create big fluctuations but it still seems weird to be that every single time the China makes it to a crypto news headline, the entire market just takes an incredibly swift nosedive. 
This is obviously oversimplified, but hypothetically speaking, what would China somehow banned residents from buying, selling, mining crypto, etc. while other major economic entities adopted crypto to some degree? I don't even really see how they could achieve banning everyone in China from holding something that only exists digitally. With the consistent reaction of the market, it seems like the takeaway is if China doesn't get on board, we all might as well pack up and head home. That's just confusing to me.

891,2021-06-22,"Security Tip #1: Secure your e-mailYour email is one of the most important things in online security that must be secured. It is often used as a confirmation/validation mechanism whether 2FA or to make any changes to online account information. It's also used as a password reset mechanism for 99.5% of websites basically. You could have the strongest passwords in the world (e.g. 50+ character randomly generated) to your other accounts, but simple access to your email disables all that security in a few clicks.

1. Use a strong password. **Don't even bother complaining about getting hacked if you are reusing passwords**, and not using randomly generated strong 12+ (at minimum) character passwords (e.g. @qO&s1Mmjdaw). Use a password manager. It may sound at times I'm a shill for password management companies, but I'm not. Use one. Virtually every single security expert believes that for the general public a password manager is more beneficial than not having one.

2. Use 2FA. Even though I [wrote about 2FA via SMS often getting conflated with password reset via SMS](https://old.reddit.com/r/CoinBase/comments/o3aeow/can_we_talk_about_sms_2fa/), I believe **2FA SMS is better than no 2FA**. Definitely use hardware tokens or TOTP authenticators if you can. If you follow #1 to the t, 2FA should serve its purpose as a safety net.

3. Login only on a device you have verified does not have viruses/trojans (e.g. a PC you control where you have anti-virus software on it) or better yet a mobile device like an updated iOS or Android device--app sandboxing is far better on mobile OSes than on desktop PCs. If your Android device is rooted or using custom APKs, don't even bother complaining about getting hacked. Similar comment if your iPhone is jailbroken.

**Edit**: Bonus Gmail material.

With all the talk about SIM swaps, I tried to investigate the concept of a recovery phone # and email that Google prompts you to add all the time. Basically these are backup options into your account in case you lose your password and/or 2SV mechanisms. I'm not 100% clear on the implications of this, but immediately what comes to mind is that I could have hardware tokens as my 2SV mechanism, but with a recovery phone #, all that security goes out the window.

To test this theory, I created a brand new account with no 2SV but a recovery phone #. I tried a forget password attempt and one of the ways to get back in was to confirm the 6 digit code in my recovery email or recovery phone # SMS. This simply means that a strong 50+ character password can be defeated by a simple SIM swap.

I'm not ready to provide full recommendations on the recovery phone / email yet as it requires more testing (e.g. with accounts that have 2SV options), but I have found at least potential weaknesses where it is vulnerable to SIM swaps. The tradeoff is without those options you can never recover your account, but from an account security perspective, it is a very weak backdoor that can be abused.",positive,0.9207955,94

**Storytime**  
Went to a Bitcoin Depot ATM in town (usa), deposited cash, it paid me Bitcoin. Quite simply, which conversation price did it base it's payout on?  
I feel like it wasn't the current usd <> btc price/exchange rate, and I paid peak price instead. (Google shows 1 BTC = 59,471.10 USD)

And if it was the sales price, *why* would it pay out a month old price? What did I miss?

**Receipt shows:**  
Market Price: 	$59,300.00 USD  
Sales Price: 	$80,470.10 USD  
Cash: 60 USD

Thanks in advance!

---

**EDIT 1: What I've learned**  
Thanks to everyone for advice. Even the snarky ones that are simply ""why ATM? Do your research"" - I thought I had, and this shows I didn't do enough. So I paid to learn.

Anyway, I learned
- I likely paid WAY too much in a service fee (around 30%) that I don't see on my receipt  
- ATMs are.... less than not great. They're*expensive* and a huge majority of them do KYC (know your customer), so they need your ID and eliminates any privacy.  
- p2p (Peer to peer or person to person) are the best way to go, but I need to do more research here. Since I don't know anyone IRL that even knows what a satoshi is, there could be some hurdles.  
- DEX (Distributed Exchanges) are probably the best way to go when buying (for me)... more research here too. Coinbase is suggested a lot, but I don't understand why they're the best... so yeah, research is needed.

I really like [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/s/SUbL8cc67I) because it gave some suggestions. I'm copy/pasting here in case it gets deleted:  
> Avoid ATMs. You should sign up for multiple reliable bitcoin exchanges. In USA, I recommend Coinbase (learn to use advanced interface to keep fees low), kraken, and my favorite is River with dollar cost average and automated withdrawal set up. ",positive,0.89744145,101

I didn't anticipate all the support I would recieve. I never thought a post about funny internet money would be the catalyst to change my outlook on life, on family, and on myself.

I've always been afraid of change, afraid that I would hurt my parents. My parents were happy, so I've always endured, for their sake. Every scenario I concocted in my head ended hurting them. I thought that if my parents were happy, I would be happy. 

For years I've told myself this. Always waiting for some outside force to change something, some force  that would probably never come. Not being  able to pull the bandaid off in fear of seeing the scar underneath, I kept trudging on, letting these delusions cloud my vision. I've been an idiot.

I could go on about the past. But now I see I'm not doing myself any good. I've always looked back. I need to stop that. The person who has been controlling me all this time has been myself. My parents aren't the real problem. The biggest problem is myself. 

I don't know what I'm going to do, what I'm going to say, but I'm going to talk with my parents, even if it hurts me to do so. I'm going to tell them my feelings, my thoughts, my wishes. I'm going forward with hope, not fear. 

All of you who have given me advice, all of you who have ridiculed me, thank you. Thank you for opening my eyes. I have so much more important things to deal with than whatever I came here hoping for.  I'm going to get off the Internet for a good while and set my priorities in order. To anyone who would care enough to use your time to talk to me, thank you. 


Original post below





I've been researching a bit in the past few weeks and want to get started investing in Bitcoin and other various things, but all the guides I've read seem to ignore the question of HOW you move money to and from a bank.

I have about 50k just withering in a savings account. I do not have a cell phone or laptop or anything else. 

My questions are:

What's the step by step process of turning money in a savings account into crypto or other investments? All the things  I've read make it sound easy, but they seem to operate on the assumption you know how banks work.

What supplies do you need? Even the things you might overlook like a phone number or bank account. I know a phone or laptop (or both?) at the very least will be needed, what else?

How do I get my parents to let me? They are not very tech savvy and wouldn't understand things like this. They are pretty untrusting of online transactions and accounts. I do not have a car so to go anywhere or buy anything I would need to explain the situation  to them. I'm afraid they'll think everything is a scam and refuse to let me.

I don't know how taxes work so I don't want to do anything taxable until the the next year. Is just buying and hodling going to cause any issues? (In the US)

Lastly, how much should I invest? I have little to no expenses and make about 250 a week.

976,2021-12-09,"The difference between encryption and hashingI see many people that don’t understand the difference between encryption and hashing. I think it’s important to know the difference in understanding both computing and how it applies to bitcoin/blockchain.

Encryption is a two way process where information is encoded and can then be decoded using matching keys or a password. Hashing is a one way process where the input cannot be reverse engineered with matching keys or a password. Encryption is used to secure data while hashing is used to guarantee the authenticity of data. 

Hashing takes an infinite amount of data as input and generates a fixed output regardless of the size. If a single bit is changed the output of the hash completely changes, this is how hashing guarantees authenticity. For example, you can download a file from the internet, run it through a hashing algorithm and compare its checksum with the reliable party. If the hashes are different you either didn’t download what you thought or the file was manipulated in transit (like if you accidentally downloaded a malicious php file instead of that naughty stepsister video from that sketchy foreign site) 

Bitcoin uses the sha256 hashing algorithm which is also used in many other things in computing to guarantee authenticity of data such as a file or a program. When it comes to the blockchain, thanks to hashing, each block is assigned an original identifier, which ensures the chain is irreversible and cannot be manipulated, guaranteeing the authenticity of each block.",positive,0.89913696,78

988,2020-08-14,"Exactly 10 years ago Someone did a transfer of 184M BTC 

Exactly 10 Years ago someone found a bug in bitcoin code that allowed him to transfer 184M bitcoins to 3 different address .

>On  August 15 2010, it was discovered that block 74638 contained a   transaction that created 184,467,440,737.09551616 bitcoins for three   different addresses.[\[1\]](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Value_overflow_incident#cite_note-1)[\[2\]](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Value_overflow_incident#cite_note-2)[\[3\]](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Value_overflow_incident#cite_note-3)  Two addresses received 92.2 billion bitcoins each, and whoever solved   the block got an extra 0.01 BTC that did not exist prior to the   transaction. This was possible because the code used for checking  transactions before  including them in a block didn't account for the  case of outputs so  large that they overflowed when summed.[\[4\]](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Value_overflow_incident#cite_note-4)  
A  new version of the client was published within five hours of  the  discovery that contained a soft forking change to the consensus  rules  that rejected output value overflow transactions (as well as any   transaction that paid more than 21 million bitcoins in an output for any   reason).[\[5\]](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Value_overflow_incident#cite_note-5)  The block chain was forked. Although many unpatched nodes continued to  build on the ""bad"" block  chain, the ""good"" block chain overtook it at a  block height of 74691[\[6\]](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Value_overflow_incident#cite_note-6) at which point all nodes accepted the ""good"" blockchain as the authoritative source of Bitcoin transaction history.  
The  bad transaction no longer exists for people using the longest chain.  Therefore, the bitcoins created by it do not exist either. While the  transaction does not exist anymore, the 0.5 BTC that was consumed by it  does. It appears to have come from a faucet and has not been used since.[\[7\]](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Value_overflow_incident#cite_note-7)

I  know a guy that I've been to school with and he's been with bitcoin  since 2010, while I criticized it and ignored it . lately we've been  catching up and talk a lot, he said basically someone is probably  manipulating the network in different way while we are unaware of.

""The  184M transaction was bold, everyone could have seen it. In the real  world if A really good hacker would do the job , he would do it without  us noticing, it will be under the surface, it might be too late if ever  could someone else even notice""

991,2021-08-27,"What happens when we reach 21M Bitcoin?As far as I understood it the whole process works as followed:
Every single transaction gets written down on the blockchain and verified together with all previous transactions.
So when people mine bitcoins they basically donate their calculating power to the cause and get rewarded for it by randomly ""finding"" bitcoins (fractions of one coin, obviously)
The more calculating power there is on the market and the closer we get to the limit of 21M coins the higher the ""difficulty"" and the less the reward you get for mining.

So.. fast forward a couple of decades and let's assume we are pretty close to the 21Million. The high difficulty makes mining not profitable anymore, because the reward is lower than the electricity bill, which leads to people stop mining.

But without the mining there is no more verification of transaction, or how is that supposed to work then?

I'm really a noob when it comes to bitcoin, so my thought process might be flawed, please enlighten me.

\- Most wallets, including BTC core, allow for the lowest fee to be 1 sat / vbyte, and most transactions are at least  \~300 vbyte in size (lowest is, afaik, 1 in 1 out segwit = \~145). This means, the cheapest (!) BTC transaction at a 100k price tag is: 300  vbyte \* 1 sat / vbyte \* $100k / BTC = 30 cents. To repeat once more, that's the absolute minimum for most current wallets, it's a technical limitation.

\- A high BTC price will also give newbies a hard time to enter the eco system. Similar to the price of a troy ounce of gold, a very high BTC price will lead people astray to buy ""something cheaper"", but that's of course a very bad idea - however, a sat might be too cheap, and something in between is hard to understand.

But my point is: if Bitcoin allows a cash-like, permissionless and transparent monetary system, that on top of that has sound economics, and can be used by anyone in the world irrespective of what the establishment and Governments say about it, the effect that price has is, at most, secondary. 

Yes, in the short term price drives adoption, but hedge funds will always hedge, and markets will always be heavily influenced (I will not say manipulated because of decentralization) by big bag holders. 

But: once more and more people (hopefully also corporations and even nations) start using Bitcoin as a unit of account, who cares what the dollar-denomination of Bitcoin might be? I mean, it's quite a drastic example, but how many of you are delighted about how filthy rich you are, measuring your wealth in Zimbabwe dollars?

It is not about becoming rich, it's about using a system that favours people, instead of central planners and banks. Of course, if on the way there some get rich, then good for them. 

Is this the way to looking at Bitcoin? Or do you see it's usage as unit of account hardly feasible?

And in terms of using it as an actual currency, the longer time goes on, the smaller the increments that will be transacted between regular people, as its value skyrockets. Decades down the road, the distribution of the currency will largely be determined by the how generous the current owners are. It's not too unlike how we're currently held to the whims of governments' spending decisions when it comes to distributing fiat, except it's even less democratic because private owners have no obligation to anyone but themselves. Governments at least have to keep up somewhat of an appearance of caring. 

I guess my question is, how is this better than the current monetary system, and how can it act as a universal currency when its supply cannot be replenished? Besides hype, what factors are actually propping the value of Bitcoin?

The only time I can see Bitcoin being useful is in times of political turmoil. If your country's fiat is not accepted, then it can serve as a backup. But I'd rather not invest in something that relies on the countries falling into disarray to prop up its value. 

Sorry if this post seems critical, I just feel like I must be missing something big here if I'm seeing all these flaws yet so many people are into Bitcoin. I'm just seeking to understand.",positive,0.6536595,73

I'm just an idiot with a computer and bought during the last dip because of a prediction off a YT video, something anybody can do. I understand there's a lot to learn, but still. Am I missing something?

Also a few quick questions. I know nobody is infallible and knows for sure but what are your favorite sources for price predictions and timing BTC's bear, accumulation, and bull runs? And how do you go paying for things that you can't with crypto? I'd like to pay for everything with crypto without having to transfer into USD but that's not practical for everything, do I just gotta bite that bullet? Thank you in advance.",positive,0.88890934,65

Anyways, I was watching the following video by 3blue1brown on Youtube:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9JGmA5\_unY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9JGmA5_unY)

He explains that it's practically impossible with today's computer power to find any specific bitcoin private key given the public key.

While that's true, in reality, that's not the approach a hacker would take. The hacker would be happy to find ANY address with money. So a more sensible approach would be to generate a random Private Key, derive the Public key (which is trivial), and check if there are funds on it. Do this a million times increasing the Private key number every time. (and you can start from at a random point in the private keyspace)

As more people adopt bitcoin, it should get just a little easier to get lucky and pick a private key with money in it, no? So my questions are:

\- While this might be hard to pull off right now because of the ratio of:

 (accounts with money) / (total accounts) 

is low, this ratio will only increase with time. How do we know when the address space is saturated and it's time to increase \`total-accounts\`?

\- Was this ""saturation"" considered in the original Bitcoin implementation and there should be no need to increase the total account number? I find this very unlikely as it's hard to predict how bitcoin will be used by companies and individuals (people can create as many wallets as they please)

I see this as the only way my investment in BTC will go to 0. I want to make sure I do it all correctly so did a bit of research.

Below is a list of all of the ways I've found that **I could lose my BTC**. My question is, am I missing anything? I'll add to/amend this list if needed, then hopefully if something like this doesn't exist then others can use it.

i) **Losing your Seed Words**: either by losing the paper/metal which you write them on or someone stealing them. Ways to overcome this:

* Don't store them on phones/computers: this takes away the whole point of cold wallets as then they can be hacked/seen through a compromised connection/PC.
* Hide them really damn well: if someone gets access to your seed words, they have access to your BTC. Treat your seed word sheet as you would treat a bar of gold.
* Don't ever send your seed words online: phishing attacks, rogue apps, and Reddit DM's all seem to be ways people have lost their coins. Don't ever give your seed words out. Always recover a lost wallet by entering seeds only on a Trezor device and never on the computer 

ii) **Wallet Setup:** it seems that a **tiny** fraction of boxes containing Trezor/Ledger get tampered with. This is something that spooks me because as a newbie, there are things that I could overlook. Ways that I've seen people safeguard against this:

* Check box/contents for tampering: the anti-tampering hologram looks pretty weak on the Trezor, but I guess that a lack of shrink-wrap or any signs of the box being opened should result in returning the item. If the seed word sheets are pre-filled, then return it. This sheet should be blank.
* Wipe prior to installing software: it seems that any malware that might be installed onto the Trezor can be removed with a wipe prior to installing the software. Do this just in case.
* Ensure software is downloaded from the legit website. [Trezor.io](https://Trezor.io) for Trezor. There are fraudulent apps in the app store which claim to be legit, but they ask for your seed words. Always verify if software claiming to be Trezor is authentic.

iii) **Burning your BTC:** for some (including me), this will be your first experience sending stuff over the blockchain. If you burn your BTC, it means you send it to the wrong wallet address. Doing this loses your BTC with no way of getting it back. Not too sure what to say apart from:

* Send over a small test amount prior to sending the rest: ensures you don't lose loads if you've messed up. I think exchanges tend to allow you to whitelist these addresses, so you can ensure it's right another time.

Do let me know what sounds good/dodgy and thanks for reading this far. Hopefully, as well as making me feel less nervous about this, it could be somewhere to link people to in the future (if this list doesn't already exist)...",positive,0.79087365,62

I purchased my first fraction of a bitcoin via coinbase today, but after only seeing this subreddit after I purchased, I feel i've made a mistake?

After browsing this subreddit it seems people do not like coinbase and I've seen a few people mention I don't actually own the bitcoin i've purchased?

Would someone be able to help a fellow novice out and let me know what steps I should take to 'secure' my bitcoin? If I should move my bitcoin to a different provider? etc.

Edit: For anyone else new to Bitcoin, to summarise the comments and to also learn from my mistakes.

1. Don’t use coinbase, their fees are high. Use coinbase pro or similar as their fees are much less.

2. An exchange and wallet are two different things. Some exchanges have wallets I.e. coinbase. You buy/sell Bitcoin via your chosen exchange. Then use wallets to store your coins securely.

3. Wallets are used to store, receive and send Bitcoin (or alt coin) just like your actual wallet. If you decide to sell your Bitcoin, you will need to send it from your wallet to your exchange. You can then sell the Bitcoin and withdraw the cash to your chosen withdrawal method.

4. DO NOT send your bitcoins to any wallet until you're confident in doing so. Also, always test sending them with the smallest amount possible. That way if you don't receive your bitcoins, you know you've messed up and don't lose everything.

I have a lot more to learn, but wanted to run a scenario by this group. 

I have about $2500 in bitcoin in Venmo. I bought it for fun curiosity when I saw Venmo was offering it. I now know Venmo is an exchange. I presume then it also acts like a hot / custodial wallet? But I could be wrong. I downloaded Blue and Green apps on my iphone. My thought was to transfer the bitcoin from Venmo to one of these wallets. But I’m not sure how different they are from Venmo. I know not to buy bitcoin from a wallet. Is this like the middle step between Venmo and a hard wallet? I think I can make a non-custodial wallet in Blue.

Upon advice from this group, I’ll be buying a hard wallet too. Either Trezor or Jade (as recommended in FAQ). I’m presuming they’ll be compatible with Blue or Green? 

Or do I just buy the hard cold wallet now and skip the app wallet and just transfer straight from Venmo? Should I keep Venmo as a means to purchase bitcoin from their exchange, move it to a non-custodial wallet at regular intervals (monthly, etc) and then move it all to hard wallet once the balance has reached a certain point? 

Related question: I have about $15k in stocks that I was thinking of cashing out and buying more bitcoin for the long haul. The stocks are about 1/2 S&P Index and 1/2 various others ( Netflix, etc). It may be wise to keep the S&P, maybe not. 

I do have about $150k in 401k and IRA accounts, so bitcoin would not be my only investment if I did this. 

My main goals are to 1. Keep the $ safe and 2. Do this as anonymously as possible. 

I also plan to set up regular interval transfers (sorry I forget the fancy acronym for this), but someone suggested $1 a day or whatnot. Would I keep Venmo for this purpose? Or use another app?

I’m a newbie and I’ve tried to learn about hardware wallets as much as I could and I think I understand the basics. Some questions I couldn’t find answers to - 
- What happens when you transfer your private keys from an exchange to a hardware wallet. Does that mean when you go to the exchange you no longer see the value of your portfolio or does the exchange keep track of that? If not what’s the best way to keep track of it?
- What’s the process of selling coin once it’s on the hardware wallet? Do the private keys have to be transferred to an exchange first and then sold?
- Whats the best way to save your passphrase? I’ve heard of metal cards, and storing partial sets of phrases on three cards in different locations. But all of this sounds complicated and I am very worried that I will lose the wallet and forget my passphrases.",positive,0.83347696,52

But if online can be hacked, and offline can be lost, what can I do?

I was thinking about having some kind of software wallet, kept inside an encrypted container that could be backed up on a cloud service (in case my harddrive breaks). But what do you think? Is this any safer than just storing them on binance or coinbase? Or is there another option that I am not thinking of?

Again, the amount is too small to be worth buying a physical wallet, I know they are considered the safest but this is not what I am looking for (at this time).

Wow, bit of an overwhelming response haha, thanks for all the advice. No one has commented anything on holding data on encrypted containers backed up on a cloud though. Any opinions on this?

Hope I won't be crucifixed for my question but I will try anyway!

Most of the time, I have read comments on here saying that Bitcoin is still the crypto to invest in, because it's solid, it's stable and has still prospects of growing.

Now with the Bitcoin reaching its ATH , how much would you think someone should invest in BTC to make it worth.

Of course depends on how much money someone is ready to ""loose"" and I understand that but in real terms, you people how many Bitcoins have? In particular those who invested in the last 2-3 years, how many BTC you have in your wallet currently?

In my specific case, to give some context:
I am a doctor in UK, so my salary is decent but nothing more than that. I have a lump of money I would be happy to invest in crypto, but this won't be more than £15-20k?
With this amount of funds, would you say it's still worth to buy like 1/4 of BTC or at this stage doesn't make sense anymore?

I am sorry if this question sounds stupid or has been already asked several times, I still hope you could give me your feedback about.

As I said, I understand the amount of money to invest depends only in how much I feel confident to loose £15-20k and never see them again happy

1282,2020-05-16,"Is Bitcoin day trading a bad idea?Hey all, I've been following Bitcoin for a couple of years and pre-halving buzz made me finally get into the game. I invested a couple of thousands of dollars and bought Bitcoin, but decided to try day trading instead of holding it.  

I managed to increase my investment by 20% in the first week of day trading but lost significantly more going forward (remember pre-halving dump?). To be honest, I didn't really understand the extreme volatility in Bitcoin prices first, but then I started to deep dive into the reasons and dynamics behind it. It appeared that there are a couple of factors that make Bitcoin trading quite a tough activity. Below two are the most obvious ones:

* **A small group of people has God-like power over Bitcoin pricing**. In Bitcoin terminology, they are called **whales**. They hold a huge amount of Bitcoin and use it to manipulate the market.  Whales enter the market with a big number of Bitcoins, usually worth more than $20M, and cause the prices to go up. As it creates a bullish trend, more and more small players like me join the trend. At some point whales simply sell their Bitcoin and dump the market and with it, prices start dumping. In this simple move, they make a huge amount of money, while small players are struggling. Sometimes they still manage to make profit by selling their Bitcoin before the situation gets worse, but sometimes it is too late and the P&L is already negative.
* **Exchanges short the market (almost) all the time.** No matter on what platform you are trading, each time you make a transaction, such as buying or selling Bitcoin, exchanges charge a small fee for that. I use Binance to trade, and their fee is 0.1% for my account (fees vary on different trading volumes). Now imagine billions of dollars worth trading volumes happening on exchanges on a daily basis, which translates into millions of dollars of worth commissions, where a big portion of them are in BTC. Very few exchanges promise to not sell their Bitcoins that came from commissions, but majority simply sell them back to the market in exchange for US Dollars. Why? Well, they have to pay their employees, satisfy their shareholders with ""real money"" and so on... Which in turn, causes even more volatility in Bitcoin prices. And obviously, most of the exchanges are unregulated, and we don't know how they are using trader and market data... Can they be a part of market manipulation? Possible. Do they really manipulate the market? Not enough data to claim this.

BTC is a good investment, I am sold on this idea. But as a day trading tool, I am not sure if I feel the same way. The very fact of the market being manipulated all the time makes the risk of Bitcoin day trading weight more than its opportunity. It would be great to hear your opinion on this.

I am not sure if all the points are exact or if I am saying something totally wrong because on Google there is a jungle of information ranking on page 1, with questionable answers to Bitcoin :)

I would appreciate if you could take the time to confirm if this is all correct :)

* Satoshi Nakamoto found the solution to digital payments and double spending without a centralized institution…  
 
* The main difference between Bitcoin and FIAT consists in having the ledger on every computer that is part of the Bitcoin network instead of only being owned by the bank where your money is deposited.  
 
* The ledger is called Block Chain, a chain made of blocks sorted in chronological order where 	each block contains a number of transactions that are virtually	impossible to be modified once written.  
 
* The	block chain is installed on every user’s computer (also called nodes) that is part of the Bitcoin network and it is constantly updated and synchronized so that all transactions are identical on 	each node.  
 
* The	nodes made by people who want to be part of the network, everybody can	be a node in the bitcoin network and have the ledger installed on their computer.  
 
* Unlike for the banks, everybody can access the transactions. However, 	they are anonymous and people can only the transactions, but not the names of the people or the owners of the accounts.  
 
* Every Bitcoin transaction made must be validated by the nodes in the block chain and each block needs to be 'sealed' by a miner.  
 
* If I decide to alter my account from my installed block chain, all the other computers in the network will be notified about 	my new balance and will work to confirm whether it is legitimate… Because I could not access to the other nodes and do 	the same change that I did on my local block chain, they would find out that there are no money moved into my account and will not validate my balance.  
 
* Furthermore, each block in the chain carries a signature from the previous block, which means that if I want to modify a transaction occurred in a certain moment, all the transactions after that will also need approval again, and the nodes in the network would need to check the transactions to see if that single change in the network is valid.   
 
* Bitcoin cannot be confiscated, 	there is no government that can decide the value of Bitcoin as it is determined by its users.  
 
* Bitcoin cannot be produced over its maximum established amount, which is 21 millions. This means that Bitcoin will not be subject to inflation.  
 
* Paying 	with Bitcoin has smaller commissions because unlike for your FIAT money, there are not as 	many middlemen involved in validating the payment, only the Bitcoin network.  
 
* Bitcoin 	is also open to all those people who don’t have access to a banking system.  
 
* We must not forget to consider that Bitcoin is at its infancy and there is no guarantee that it will 	continue to exist over time or that it will increase in value.",positive,0.86479944,45

1382,2021-03-16,"If Bitcoin was created during the recession with a goal to help combat wealth inequality, how is it actually going to do that?The way I understand it, over 18 of the total 21 million coins have already been mined in its eleven years of existence. I read somewhere that only 1.5% of the global population owns Bitcoin. I'm guessing the majority of that 18 million are owned by ""whales"" who, at this stage, could basically hold forever.

So how do people expect this to play out for the next 50 years? Or even the next 5-20 years? The whales will likely still be holding, while that 1.5% world population of people buying Bitcoin expands to maybe 5% or 10%, and the vast majority will only ever be able to afford fractions and their savings will never amount to a single full Bitcoin.

I'm not factoring in the unknown amount that will be lost over time. Crashed computers, lost passwords, and people will die unexpectedly without a plan for who takes over their wallets when they're dead. So that 21 million will never actually reach 21 million because so many will have been lost by the time our children's children's children finish mining. All of those generations of children who will be living in Bitcoin poverty because of the scarcity, unless they're one of the lucky descendents of original whales... which brings us back to the same wealth gap issues we have today.

TLDR: who will have a legitimate chance of gaining wealth if they weren't an early Bitcoin investor or an already wealthy person who could still afford to buy into a healthy portion at or above today's price per coin?

If you'r a hodler, what is the point of having hardware wallet (or any permanent wallet) ?

Why cant the following scenario work:

1. Buy bitcoins on exchange
2. Transfer to any established soft wallet
3. Save the pass phrases offline
4. Uninstall the wallet.

Any time in the future you need access, you install any other ""compatible"" wallet and get access to your coins.

Doesnt it all come to saving passphrases offline securely ? Even with hardware wallet you need to save them somewhere separate just in case you loose the wallet anyway ! Essentially your wealth is in the network, all you need is to ""remember"" the access to it.

What am I missing ?

Update:

So much ""blind faith"" in hardware manufacturers. Seems like lot of people dont realize how hardware is made. Its software embedded in it, Its created by humans. Humans building hardware can not be more trustworthy than those building software. If you dont trust one you should not trust the other.  Just because its ""offline"" it doesnt mean its more trustworthy. Itsnt it obvious ?

Update2:

Its obvious Im against a ""religion"" here. And its not my intention or place to ""convert"" you or convince you. Im in the process of figuring this out  and I'd like this to be helpful to other new comers. Ultimately we want as much adoption of digital currency as possible. So bring up proper explanations why should people spend extra money on wallets and why its more secure than piece of paper. Thats on you, not me.

Update3:

3 words: supply chain attack. Its very real and not hard, especially if you have your hardware made in some 3rd world country or China. Your HW could be compromised and neither you or your manufacturer would have any idea.

Update4:

For tech savvy, HW with open source software on rasp pi.

I came across this blog post called [How China can kill bitcoin](http://galgitron.net/Post/How-China-Can-Kill-Bitcoin) and thought that the author does have quite a good point (despite the tone of the blog post). He argued that the top 4 Chinese mining pools alone represent more than 51% of the hashrate and if the Chinese government are to forcibly commandeer these top 4 mining pools (without having to buy new mining equipment) then they can easily orchestrate the 51% attack within an hour and a double-spend would have been successful.

1. If this all is true, wouldn't you say that China is quite a big threat to the existence of bitcoin? Isn't this something we should be more worried about? (it seems that most of bitcoin community just assumed that no one will attempt the 51% attack and it has been debunked many times).

1413,2020-08-08,"Bitcoin endgameHi everybody 
I am still getting started in the world of cryptocurrencies, focusing on understanding how bitcoin works. I chose bitcoin because it is the most established cryptocurrency and with the higher chance of becoming a full fledge currency worldwide, being used by everyone (at least that’s what I think at the moment, I might be wrong here)
I know that the practical limit for bitcoin is 21 million bitcoins and each bitcoin can be divided into 100 million satoshi.
My question is, assuming bitcoin takes over as a single global currency and everyone is using it, isn’t the total amount of satoshi too little? I mean, if you split the total amount of bitcoin by everyone in the world, each person receives a relative small amount of bitcoin (I did a rough estimate, and from my estimates, each person would have the equivalent of 30€ in bitcoin)

Thanks in advance for dedicating the time to this weird question :)

EDIT: 

Thank you all for the answers.
Like it has been said I agree that the main obstacle for bitcoin to become the one currency on a global scale is politics because no one, in this case governments would like to loose control of their money.

With the increase in market cap and the subdivision of satoshi’s (part that I was unaware of), bitcoin could be used as the global currency  because, at the same time, bitcoin would have enough “value” to represent the global economy and would be divisible enough to a reasonable value for cheap stuff like a bottle of water.

The main technical issue that I see at the moment is the difference to fiat in how bitcoin is stored (hardware wallets) and transferred between two entities (addresses and private keys). For me it is something that I am starting to understand but I think it would be close to impossible for the majority of people that are older / not so tech oriented. I haven’t yet bought bitcoin, just got a bit of exposure to it using Revolut and decided to explore it on a deeper level.

One other thing that was referred was that subdividing satoshi’s is similar to “printing” money and would lead to inflation. I understand why this is being said, because creating money or dividing the current supply into smaller amounts can be seen as having the same overall effect. I think that the key difference in the division of satoshi’s is that it is not controlled by a central authority. For example if a new base unit that corresponded to 1/100 of a satoshi was created, everyone would be affected equally. When money is being printed by  a central bank or government, they are increasing their wealth by making everyone else poorer, since they are increasing the percentage of money they have (note that I am not an economist and this explanation probably is flawed).",positive,0.9188854,46
