10,2024-11-18,"Bull Run Dilemma: Exit Strategy vs Asset SecurityThere’s a major issue during a bull run: how to combine an effective exit strategy with securing your assets.

Let me explain: when using a CEX, you can optimize your exit strategy with tiered reverse DCA or even more advanced orders like trailing stops or OCO orders. This is crucial because, during a bull run, speed of execution is key, and you can’t automate these kinds of strategies on a DEX with a hot wallet, let alone with a cold wallet, which might take hours or even days to transfer your assets.

However, keeping your funds on a CEX exposes you to risks like hacks or the platform going bankrupt, which isn’t ideal either.

Is there a solution to combine the security of a cold wallet with the reliable execution of an advanced exit strategy?

* I got in relatively early and the price is unlikely (I assume) to drop as low as this again.
* I would like to have the maximum amount of coins to keep for another 5 years or so, at least as many as I have now.

59,2024-11-16,"Grow a bag first, then investNot sure what to title this post, but it applies to all investment markets not just cryptocurrency.

I have been investing since I was 18, and I am now 32. I made this mistake myself and I find that it is not often talked about online. 

In short: if you have a small bag (less than 50k) and you are looking to invest. IMO, don't.

Use that money and build something. The return on building a small business, a product, a freelancing company, learning a skill, taking a class, etc. will always be a far better ROI.

Let me explain with some numbers that were my own. At the age of 20, I had about $10,000 USD to invest. I researched and managed a return of 13%. This sounds good, but it was mostly luck. And even if it weren't it's still not enough. 

Let's extrapolate and say that I do this every year for 5 years. 
10k * 1.13 = $11,300
$11,300 * 1.13 = $12,769
…
Year 5 yields a total of $18,424.35 In 5 years, I made $8,424.35

This is not a life changing amount of money for 5 years. 

The trade of 5 years for 8,400 is not enough.

Instead, let's say I take that $10,000 and invest in myself. 

I take a coding bootcamp for $5000, get a job paying $20,000 more than I had previously, and in 1 year, I am up $15,000. I pay my taxes, and I am still at $10,000. I had to work, but I now have a skill. Over the next 3 years, I get 3 raises. I had to work anyway. The profits from my 10,000 are not nearly enough. 

It's far better to work on a skill than to invest with small amounts. 

However, instead let's say I have $100,000. 

This is quite different. 

My first year, I will make $13,000 in profits. Likely competitive with my annual raises at my coding job. 

After 5 years, I will have made $84,000 in interest. 

I could have even took 10k from that 100k to take more classes, invest in equipment, grow my skills, etc. and my returns will still be close to that. 
The mistake I made was investing too soon. Go work really hard when you are young, invest in yourself, build. your skills, and grow a bag. Then invest when you have a chunk.

As a final note: if you do invest in risky crypto markets and manage to hit 100k early on, sell it all, and switch to a slower strategy. You will have just skipped 5+ years of early investing and you are set up to win. Don't mess it up by gambling it.",positive,0.88913995,0

I’ve been thinking about the future of crypto and wondering which technologies will shape this space in the coming years. What will dominate, and why? For example, will it be things like **DeFi (Decentralized Finance)**, or something else? Which crypto-related technologies might become part of our daily lives and actually make them better?

It would be great if you could share **trustworthy sources** (like videos or research papers) that discuss where the crypto industry is heading. I’m especially interested in learning about:

* The technologies we’re using now in crypto.
* What new technologies might appear soon because there’s a demand for them.

If you know of any good YouTube videos or research papers on this, please share them. Your help is really appreciated! happy",positive,0.89397717,0

The above address is the contract address for fake tokens being labeled as BDAG on Uniswap. An initial scan of the etherscan provided through the Uniswap DeX will provide no evidence of the scam to the buyer other than the dialog which states the tokens are not commonly sold on DeX which incidentally also will appear for tokens of like type which are being reported to be legitimate in nature at this time...

Be on alert for fake tokens being sold also as RXS which is also a honeypot, or ponzi-scheme type of activity...

  
Also, Please be on alert if you have an interest in purchasing the BlockDAG pre-sale... There is a user operating on Telegram group which is being labled as BlockDAG support named Shaq, who is providing a phishing link to unsuspecting potential buyers of BlockDAG... The Phish here is that the BlockDAG connect to Uniswap wallet feature has a bug, that will state insufficient funds even though that is not the case, and then when the user goes in search of support to help with this problem, they Phish the user who thinks that everything is official and legitimate... Moments after co-oiperating with Shaq you will find that your wallet will be drained of everything...

This is the address of the malicious wallet:  
0x619b27Ef891904B3821eB703D7D49Fa7C42B2D2C

If one looks, they will find the wallet may contain also fake tokens that this Phish scammer has leeched from the public as well as real tokens.... I am reporting this activity, and I hope that the users of these malicious addresses will be stopped without delay... If anyone knows anything about the scams that are taking place and who may be behind this activity I am urging any member of the public to please turn in any information you have to the highest level of authority that you can find access to... I can tell you that what I found as a first time user of Uniswap DEX had chilled me to the bone, and I can't possibly imagine it that people are going to navigate this type of system without a problem without special experience and help...

82,2024-11-15,"You can outperform 99% of market participants**Curious information for readers:**

 100% of trades using the ""Holding + Averaging"" strategy on Bitcoin over the past couple of years are profitable

 Annual returns range from tens to 100%+ without using leverage

 The risk of ruin is 0%

Thus, using this simple approach, you can outperform the vast majority of market participants and, with high probability, significantly grow your capital by traditional standards.

**On the other hand, a person who has been engaged in trading over the past couple of years:**

 Has about a 99% chance of finding themselves among the 99%+ who have lost money trading and, moreover, have performed worse than simply holding BTC

 Is likely facing psycho-emotional and physical problems caused by constant stress

 Regrets the time wasted

**What does it take to spend 1% of the time to outperform 99% of traders and significantly grow your capital?**

 Understanding the fundamental principles of BTC’s long-term price growth: limited supply (21M) vs. infinite demand (fiat)

 Understanding the key factors that will influence price formation in the coming months and years: purchasing all new supply by Michael Saylor ($42B over the next 2 years), daily inflows via ETFs amounting to hundreds of millions, and a high probability of forming strategic reserves at the level of countries and individual US states, corporations

 On the other hand: daily mining of 450 Bitcoins (about $40M), not all of which end up on the market. Understanding the relationship between this supply and the demand described above

 Understanding the ""Holding"" strategy: the asset has fundamental value that grows over time, so it is never sold during drawdowns

 Understanding the ""Averaging"" strategy:  
a) Buying the asset at regular intervals averages the entry point and smooths out variance  
b) Buying more during drawdowns yields better EV (Expected Value) the deeper the drawdown

I'm a 40 y/o from Bucharest, Romania. 3 years ago today ( yes, it was actually 15.11.2021 believe it or not ) I decided to go into crypto, NFT's & play to earn games, after about 1 month of reading as much as I could about everything.

Initially started by having someone rent me a team in Axie Infinity, hated it ( I suck at those kind of games, evem though I really don't suck at broader known game genres ), looked for others stuff and got into multiple projects, metaverse stuff ( Decentraland and I guess Sandbox is also into that category ), a handful of move to earn apps and a few other games. To be noted that everything except ETH, POL and SOL is based on those chains and games related ( I'm a core PC gamer basically and got drawn by the whole ""own the items"" pitch ).

At this point in time over 50% of the smaller project I invested in have rugged / slow rugged ( or whatever, they're gone ). Others are not doing so well as the hype died. Others I guess are trying their best and still going hard at it but I really lost faith that any of my crypto assets will ever get back at even the initial value I invested.

Honestly... I'm kinda done with the whole thing. I probably also lack the time, knowledge and skills to make some really good moves that would end in some palpable profits. So I decided to sell everything. The problem is I've been out of the loop for so long ( 1 year of nothing and 1 year of on & off ) that I have no clue what the easiest way to do this would be.

85-90% of what I own is in my Metamask and Phantom wallets. Only Cex I used was Binance but I have nothing on it, just used it to get crypto and then get it on my Metamask / Phantom wallets.

Polygon’s native token, POL, recently hit an all-time low at $0.285, sparking questions about its future. This price drop contrasts sharply with the impressive growth in Polygon’s ecosystem, which has seen its Total Value Locked (TVL) rise from $772 million to over $1.23 billion in the past year.

Despite these gains in network activity, POL’s price has not kept pace, creating a puzzling disconnect between the platform’s success and the token’s performance.

QVM (QAN Virtual Machine) is a first-of-its-kind blockchain VM that runs statically linked ELF Linux binaries as smart contracts, providing a deterministic and secure environment.  Each contract is executed in a CPU-level sandbox, with QVM’s synthetic Linux kernel translating non-deterministic system calls into compatible versions.

The cool part? Devs can write smart contracts in nearly any language that compiles to Linux, skipping the typical quirks of blockchain-specific languages. This opens up huge possibilities for DeFi and Layer 2 projects, with major gains in developer accessibility, scalability, and performance.

I’m genuinely trying to understand something about Bitcoin and cryptocurrency.

I’ve heard a lot about how crypto (especially Bitcoin) is supposed to be a way to transfer wealth and close the financial gap between older generations, like Boomers, and younger generations, like Gen Z and Millennials.

While it’s true that crypto has made a lot of new millionaires, hasn’t that happened at the expense of other Millennials and Gen Z investors who end up “holding the bag”? I don’t see older generations selling their traditional assets like stocks, real estate, or bonds to buy Bitcoin.

So, how did this narrative that Bitcoin is reducing the income or wealth gap become so popular? From what I’ve seen, it’s mostly wealthy (young) people who can afford or want to buy in.

While stocks are backed by cashflow, can pay dividends and provides ownership of real assets like products, buildings, business intelectual property etc. Bitcoin gives nothing (?)

Also, another argument is that fiat currency is not backed by anything and is inflating… well.. is BTC backed?

134,2024-11-14,"How US Oil & Gas Flaring Powers Crypto MiningFlaring, the wasteful burning of natural gas at oil sites, is now being harnessed to power crypto mining. By capturing this otherwise wasted energy, companies can reduce pollution while fueling blockchain networks, turning what was once a pollutant into productive energy for crypto. This approach not only cuts emissions but transforms environmental waste into economic value, showing how innovation can tackle pollution and generate profit simultaneously.

Here’s how it works: at oil drilling sites, excess natural gas that can’t be easily transported is usually burned off in a process called *flaring*, creating pollution and wasting energy. Instead of flaring, companies now capture this gas to power mobile crypto mining units on-site. The natural gas runs generators that power the computers needed for mining cryptocurrency.

Why it’s so good:

1. **Reduces Pollution**: Capturing the gas cuts down on flaring emissions, reducing harmful greenhouse gases.

2. **Turns Waste into Profit**: Instead of letting valuable energy go to waste, it’s used to create cryptocurrency, turning a loss into a financial gain.

3. **Efficient Energy Use**: This solution makes use of otherwise stranded energy, making the oil and gas process more efficient and sustainable. ",positive,0.9150895,4
135,2024-11-14,"Pluto in Aquarius means Crypto is going to go crazy.Hey guys some big astrological events are going on. Starting on Nov. 19, 2024 Pluto leaves Capricorn and enters Aquarius, where it will stay through Jan. 19, 2044. The last time this happened was the American Revolution (1775–1783) and the beginning of the French Revolution (1789) were defining events. Both revolutions emphasized ideals of liberty, equality, and challenging monarchies and traditional power structures.

Pluto (power & transformation) meeting Aquarius (innovation & rebellion) is showing us exactly what's happening right now. X is evolving beyond traditional media as we're seeing in real time with Elon, and crypto is absolutely going crazy as it represents true financial freedom. Trump understands and supports crypto because he sees it's the future and America needs to get on board with this global financial revolution.

The way Pluto in Aquarius represents decentralization and disruption of old systems is playing out perfectly with crypto right now. We're watching this massive transformation in how people view and use money, with crypto adoption accelerating and traditional financial structures being challenged.

But overall, this transit emphasizes themes of equality, freedom, and collective empowerment, meaning that the digital landscape may see major shifts. For example, there could be movements toward open-source technology, the decentralization of social media platforms, and an increased focus on community ownership

TLDR; invest in Crypto and AI and ur gonna be fuck you rich in 2044 when we look back to the start of it cause Elon is gonna make it mainstream and soon its gonna be globally used on a much larger scale based off how shit is looking rn ",positive,0.88006324,22
136,2024-11-14,"Why is my futures position initial margin changing? 
Unsure of the correct flair to attach 

I have futures positions opened and while I’m not necessarily concerned that they will get liquidated or hit the SL’s given they would have to correct and tank (until the inevitable crash happens that ushers in the next bear market) I am concerned that the liquidation prices seems to have now adjusted to where I now had to update my SL since it was now below what it was saying what the liquidation price would be - which has changed because I was very specific with where I put my Stop Loss orders

I’m also confused and kind of annoyed that my margin seems to be changing. I divided it up so there was 200 USDT put into each position and now the position margins have steadily decreased to 180-190 USDT, why is this happening? I’m bothered that this will continue to happen as my gains rise and thus inevitably diminish what should be gains of a $200 position to a $160 position for instance…that’s a 20% loss in the overall profit amount I should be making. E.g if my inevitable profit from my $200 USDT futures position was $10,000 it could end up only being like $6,000-$7,000 because for some reason my margin is changing

Recently had a truly abysmal experience Coinbase. I invested £2000 and after reading about others experiences, I’m pretty sure they have locked/restricted my account. 
Immediately after my first purchase I was unable to buy and sell any crypto.
My card details no longer appear as options to use when trying to purchase or sell. 
I contacted support and they told me my account had a “bug” but the incident has been passed over to the engineering team, and I should receive an 
email in 1-2 business days.

Two weeks later I still haven’t heard anything and now every time I try and contact them, the wait time keeps increasing. Now its at 4 hours wait time and the chat disconnects EVERY TIME the timer gets near to completing.
After a couple days of worrying my £2000 was lost, and failure to get my cards to appear on my pay options despite being linked to my account, I managed to connect my PayPal account (for withdrawals only) and I managed to withdraw my £2000 in £1000 intervals, so I essentially lost £150 to transaction fee’s.

I feel so scammed I want to cry. Now seeing how much BTC has risen has made my feelings even worse, I feel so terrible.
So I really just want a trustworthy trading platform where my account won’t become locked an inaccessible for no reason. I’ve considered kraken and Revolut but I’ve even read stories of people’s accounts being locked and lost on those platforms too!
Are there any safe platforms? I feel so frustrated right now I don’t know what to do. I just feel like I’ve missed a massive opportunity, it really feels like a massive blow to my psyche.

They say, 'Sir, do you think Bitcoin will make it?' And I tell them, 'It’s not about making it. Bitcoin, it’s been on a journey, folks. A beautiful journey. Like a phoenix, up and down, up and down, very dramatic—some people say too dramatic.' I don’t know about that, but I do know a thing or two about making numbers great again.

And let me tell you something, if Bitcoin is gonna make it by EOY, it's going to be because of—what?—me. It’s not gonna happen because of Sleepy Joe, believe me. That I can tell you. You know what they say about Bitcoin? Digital gold. They say, 'Sir, it’s the digital gold.' And I say, 'Look, I know gold, folks. Beautiful, shiny, tremendous. And Bitcoin? It’s got the same energy, okay? It’s got spirit.' So will it reach the moon by EOY? Well, I don’t know, but I can tell you this: with me, it's got a chance. The best chance.

What's the chance of BTC being hacked, given that the king of cryptocurrencies relies on a very ""standard"" hash algorithm, which is not quantum resistant and making it quantum resistant would imply a fork (or multiple disordered forks), which would mean the end of the cryptocurrency as we know it as well?
If so, wouldn't it be enough to drop every investment on any cryptocurrency, hence the collapse of BTC triggers the fall of all the crypto market, even if some cryptocurrencies are quantum resistant?

 I would love to do Leveraged Trading. I believe bitcoin will hit to 100k. It will go up or down, but regardless I believe it will hit 100k.  

I would love to a 10x, 100x or even 1000x leveraged trading if possible. I know the risk. But I want to do leveraged trading with a negative balance protection. 

I don't mind losing $100.

My strategy is that I will not lose more than my inital deposit. I'm from Canada and I was wondering what Crypto Exchange that is Safe and Regulated Allowed this? 

I saw Kraken and created an account. I noticed they only do 5x Leveraged and no Negative Balance Protection.

  
This is Basically the Scenario I want. What place does this.

Scenario:

**Position Details**: You start with a $5000 position (5x leverage on your $1000 investment).

1. **Price Movement**: Bitcoin’s 5% price increase raises the position’s value by $250.
2. **Profit Calculation**: This $250 gain is added to your initial $1000, giving you a total of $1250.
3. **Profit Percentage**: Your gain on the initial investment is $250 on $1000, equating to a 25% return.

* **5% Bitcoin Increase** = **$500 profit** (50% return on your initial investment)
* **5% Bitcoin Decrease** = **$500 loss** (50% loss on your initial investment)
* **10% Bitcoin Decrease** = **Liquidation** and loss of entire $1000 investment.

Which has garnered the attention of 70,000+ people. The idea is to not worry about buying an ATH into a clear bull market with a higher uptrend. Since posting, BTC has gained around 10% and alts varying, but higher.

  
Obviously each week that goes by, less and less gains will be achievable.

  
I believe BTC will form at the 100K for psychological reasons and then money will flow to ETH/SOL.

What makes it even better is the fund’s diversified portfolio, holding assets like BTC, USDT, and USDC. This ensures it remains stable and liquid, even during market turbulence. For me, knowing there’s a solid safety net like this gives me a lot more confidence when trading on the exchange

Remaining within the crypto industry without engaging with international crypto-friendly banking made these issues less apparent.

245,2024-11-11,"URGENT SCAM WARNING - Help Report This Persistent ScammerHello, Reddit community,

I'm reaching out to warn you all about a recurring scam operation that has been exploiting the cryptocurrency community on Reddit, specifically targeting users in subreddits like *ledgerwallet* and *CryptoCurrency* and probably others. This scammer operates a fake subreddit, c*ryptoleak(s)*, where they use deceptive posts to lure unsuspecting users into clicking wallet-draining links. Despite repeated reports, this activity has continued for a month now, and Reddit has yet to take action.

**The ScamPattern:**  
Recently, I've noticed a troubling trend: various stories get posted across the crypto community, some positive, some negative, but all ultimately serve the same malicious purpose. Here’s what typically happens:

1. **Fake Positive Stories:** Positive stories get posted and either contain or eventually get edited to include a link to a wallet-draining site. These links typically lead to the subreddit c*ryptoleak(s)*, a fake subreddit full of scam posts and fake documentation that appears legitimate. Once there, users are directed to a counterfeit AMLBot site or a fraudulent revoke(dot).cash page that steals their assets.
2. **Fake Preventative Guides on Negative Stories:** When negative stories or warnings are posted, the scammer group immediately jumps in, posting advice on “how to prevent getting drained.” These comments or posts also link back to c*ryptoleak(s)*, leading users through fake guides on contract revocation or wallet protection, which again are designed to drain wallets.

**Organized Effort to Bury Legitimate Warnings:**  
When I posted a warning about this scam, it initially gained over 150 upvotes, bringing visibility to this issue. However, within hours, the scammer used bot accounts or alternate accounts to downvote my post aggressively, bringing it from 150+ upvotes to below -20, effectively burying it from view. Meanwhile, the scam posts in c*ryptoleak(s)*, often posted by *CuddlyBubbles69*, are quickly boosted with fake “satisfied customer” comments and likes, making them appear trustworthy.

**Efforts to Report the Scammer:**  
I have tried every reporting option available on Reddit, but so far, no action has been taken. In fact, I received a warning from Reddit, claiming I was abusing the system and spam-reporting this user, which is frustrating given that my goal is only to prevent further harm in the community.

**What You Can Do to Help:**

1. **Upvote this post** to keep it visible and warn others about these scams.
2. **Report CuddlyBubbles69 and the** c*ryptoleak(s)* **subreddit** for fraudulent activity. Hopefully, with enough reports, Reddit will recognize the severity of this issue.
3. **Stay cautious** of any posts in *ledgerwallet*, *CryptoCurrency*, or other related subs claiming to provide protection from wallet drainers, especially if they link to fake AMLBot or revoke(dot)cash sites.

This has been an exhausting battle, but I’m determined to protect users from falling into this trap. While I know we can’t stop these scammers entirely, with enough support from this community, we can at least slow them down or make it harder for them to continue their harmful activities. Thank you for any help you can provide, and please stay vigilant.",positive,0.7360849,1

My question is a bit more basic but valid. 

I have a ledger with most of my holdings and I switched mostly to kracken now just because I like it better than coin base. I have some ve chain on base but that's the only one not available in kracken. 

Anyway my question is should I start moving my entire portfolio into kracken? So I can take profits? 

Then once I take profits and stack again move back to my ledger for safe keepings?

I'm assuming this is kinda the general consensus because otherwise you won't be ready to take profits if you have to do all the sending and shit with your cold wallet. 

Thanks guys! I hope we all get rich! Mostly me but some of you too!! 

Also last question is I have a pretty decent portfolio plan. 

I'm going mostly for sui, fet, render, and I hold most of eth. 

I hold some BTC and some xrp. I'm mostly doubting the xrp. Kinda feeling I should take my xrp profits right now and move more into sui, ada, and sol.

I might also miss alts that will do anything, which is another downside of this strat, but if I hit right ones I'm golden (famous last words of average gambler, I know).

335,2024-11-07,"The Etherum Renaissance: A Tale of Resilience and OpportunitySo, I've been diving deep into the crypto space, and you know what? The more I look around, the more I feel like Ethereum is on the brink of a major comeback. It's like, everyone's memory is so short, they've forgotten the rollercoaster that was Solana not too long ago. Remember when Solana tanked by 96%? Oh, how the mighty have fallen and risen again!

  
Now, it's like Solana's had its moment in the sun, and while it's doing well, it feels like the cycle is turning. Ethereum, on the other hand, seems to be at a low, but not just any low. It's that kind of low where you can smell the potential, like a spring garden after a long winter. 

  
Let's talk about projects. Ethereum is where the real innovation happens. It's not just about the big names like Uniswap or MakerDAO anymore. There's a whole universe of low cap projects that are just waiting to explode. Take $peiro, for instance. Low cap, sure, but with a vision that could take it places. It's like finding a hidden gem in the vast sea of Ethereum's vast ecosystem. 

  
Why Ethereum, you ask? Well, it's not just about the tech or the market cap. It's about the community, the developers who've been here since day one, tweaking, building, and dreaming up the future of DeFi, NFTs, and beyond. Ethereum's infrastructure has been battle-tested, and even with its occasional gas fee drama, it's learning, adapting, and improving. 

  
There's this vibe in the air, like the calm before the storm. Ethereum's time is coming. It's not just a rebound; it's a renaissance. The projects on Ethereum are not just moonshots; they're moon missions with a roadmap. They're not just chasing the hype; they're building for the long haul. 

  
Imagine getting into Ethereum projects now, at what might be the very bottom. It's not about FOMO; it's about foresight. It's about seeing the potential in what Ethereum has always promised: a decentralized future where smart contracts run the world. 

  
So, here's my two cents: if you've been watching from the sidelines, now's the time to dive in. Ethereum's not just for the whales or the early adopters anymore. It's for anyone who believes in the power of decentralized finance, in the art and tech of NFTs, in the governance of DAOs. 

  
Don't let this moment pass by because once Ethereum starts its climb, you'll wish you had taken the leap. Think of it like catching the wave just as it begins to swell. Ethereum's time is coming, and with it, opportunities for those who dare to dream big. Make your choice, but remember, Ethereum isn't just a currency; it's a canvas for the future. And in that canvas, there are many masterpieces waiting to be discovered.   
Now, what are you waiting for? Let's make some smart choices and ride this wave together.",positive,0.9042128,1
336,2024-11-06,"Why Hasn’t VeChain ($VET) Blown Up Yet? Will It Ever?Alright, so I’ve been keeping tabs on VeChain for a minute now, and I gotta ask: with all the solid fundamentals, real-world use cases, and legit partnerships, why hasn’t $VET taken off yet? Is it just the market dragging everything down, or is there something else holding it back? Let’s break down what makes VeChain special and why it might just be the sleeper project waiting for its big moment.

**1. Why VeChain Deserves More Love** VeChain isn’t some pump-and-dump coin or flavor-of-the-month project. It’s actually making real moves, especially in the enterprise space. Think supply chain logistics, luxury goods, food safety—all things that aren’t exactly hyped but are huge in the real world.

**Key Highlights:**

* **Actual Utility**: Big names like BMW and Walmart China are using VeChain to boost transparency and streamline their supply chains.
* **Solid Token System**: The $VET and $VTHO setup makes sense for businesses that want less volatility when using blockchain.
* **Heavy-Hitter Partnerships**: Companies like PwC and DNV backing VeChain add serious credibility.
* **Green and Efficient**: The PoA model means low energy usage—a big deal in today’s world.

**2. Real-World Applications That Matter** Here’s where VeChain is already flexing its muscles:

* **Supply Chain Wins**: Tracking everything from factory to consumer to fight counterfeits and improve efficiency.
* **Healthcare**: Transparent patient records, vaccine traceability—not just ideas, but things already happening.
* **Sustainability Goals**: With VeCarbon, companies are actually measuring and managing their carbon footprints.
* **Anti-Fake Goods**: Brands use VeChain to prove authenticity. If you’ve ever paid extra for something real, you know how important this is.

**But Why Hasn’t $VET Pumped?** So, with all that, why is $VET still kinda sleeping on its potential?

**Challenges and the Bigger Picture:**

* **Tough Competition**: Enterprise blockchain is no joke. IBM and other giants are out there too, so it’s not exactly a walk in the park.
* **Market Blues**: The whole crypto scene has been down lately, thanks to macro stuff like inflation and rate hikes. Even solid projects are struggling to get attention.

**3. Is VeChain Ready for a Comeback? Here’s the Deal:** Let’s get into why VeChain could be primed for a rebound:

**Step 1: Macro Recovery** When the market gets back on track, projects with real use cases are usually the first to move. VeChain’s fundamentals put it in a good spot for that.

**Step 2: On-Chain Signs** Despite the dip, on-chain data shows $VTHO usage is steady, meaning people are still using the network. That’s a good look.

**Step 3: It’s Got Street Cred** VeChain’s partnerships aren’t just for show. Big brands trust it, and that’s not something every blockchain project can say.

**Step 4: Chart Watch** TA heads, take note: $VET is sitting around some key support levels. Historically, these have been where price reversals start. Combine that with any good news, and we could see a move.

**4. So, What’s the Verdict?** Nobody’s got a crystal ball, but VeChain’s got the fundamentals, partnerships, and real-world use cases to potentially make a comeback when market conditions improve. But I wanna know what you think: with all this going for it, why hasn’t $VET popped off yet? And do you think it’s just a matter of time before it does?

369,2024-11-04,"THE US PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION AND THE MARKETS EXPLAINED IN 90 SECONDS (Non Shill Content)**Voting.**  
US election voting occurs and concludes on November 5th. That's that. Voting is over.

**When does the United States get it's new President?**  
The new President of the USA is not sworn in until January 6th, 2025 at the swearing in ceremony. This is where the peaceful transfer of power from one person to another occurs.

**What happens after the polls close and before January 6th?**  
Public and Legal Consensus of who is the clear winner is an important and hot topic. This occurs prior to the swearing in ceremony on January 6th. Usually when it is generally accepted by the media and citizens that one candidate no longer has a viable path to get the 270 electoral college votes needed to beat the other. Case closed and we can all move on-kind of......

This generally occurs on election night. But it is unknown how many State's results will be contested and for how long these contests will be open for-if at all. These are almost always resolved as soon as possible at the Supreme Court of the United States, as they have the final say on the legality of the contests. Note that it is not uncommon to have contested results go on for days or weeks. ***See Bush/Gore election 2000 which was not resolved until 36 days after the election. Yikes.***

The goal is to have it resolved for the good of the Union as soon as humanly possible, as having it unresolved causes civil discomfort, financial volatility in all financial markets and so on. Tons of FUD.

This election is not expected to be resolved on election night,

***unless there is such a massive landslide for one candidate that it is blatantly obvious***

In other words, if on election night or the next day, if it is a close race-we can expect lawsuits to be filed immediately by both political parties. This would mean more volatility and a step into the unknown, for an unknown amount of time, with an unknown result.

The crypto market like all markets will react with increased volatility anytime it is presented with ""known unknowns"".

So What Happens Next?  
No one knows.

The main barrier, for the longest time, has been the lack of practical ways to spend directly in crypto. Personally, since 2021, I’ve barely used a bank account or card for online payments because the fees are just... insane! But recently, for some subscriptions, I had to try out Redotepay. It’s okay, but when I go through Google Pay, it costs me $12 in the mobil App instead of $8 directly on  site web for my X premium. Why the price difference? Who knows.

As for Bitget Pay, it could actually be a solid alternative. No transaction fees, fast, convenient... sounds better than Google Pay or Apple Pay for regular payments, especially without extra fees. But for now, it’s limited to BTC, ETH, and USDT. It’d be even better if they added TON and TRX.

Despite its unmatched stability and security, Bitcoin has largely stayed on the sidelines of the DeFi revolution, which has mostly flourished on more flexible blockchains like Ethereum. DeFi has shown its potential: lending, borrowing, earning yields, and managing risk—all without traditional banks. But Bitcoin hasn’t fully tapped into this potential.

BitSmiley aims to bridge this gap by bringing DeFi directly to Bitcoin. The platform is built on three core pillars: an overcollateralized stablecoin to stabilize transactions, secure decentralized lending, and insurance products to cover market risks. Their token is set to list on Bitget on November 6, a significant milestone. The question remains: can BitSmiley provide the liquidity needed to sustain such a robust DeFi ecosystem on Bitcoin?

If you've ever tried to turn even the simplest thing into a trading view indicator using artificial intelligence either chatGPT or even Google's gemini or claude, nobody lets you. 

Anyways, this is important because way back when everyone was doing support and resistance analysis for binance, all those lines started breaking as soon as coinbase got more volume. So it became useless to chart on binance. So I started charting on coinbase and made a ton of money for years and now suddenly once again, my trend lines became useless. Bitcoin price would just ignore the trend lines and blast straight through them or just use them as fake outs and break through then dump down to hell. 

And then it finally hit me, Black Rock does 20 times more volume than coinbase or binance put together and nobody has a Bitcoin chart for Black Rock volume.

The BTC/USDT chart is displaying a clear bullish momentum, supported by significant technical breakouts and positive trend alignment across multiple timeframes. Recently, BTC successfully broke and bounced off the **66500** level, reinforcing this area as strong support. Additionally, a structural breakout occurred at the previous swing high of **70000**, indicating a shift in market sentiment towards further upside.  
  
Currently, the Ribbon and Trend indicators are bullish on the **1-hour, 4-hour, daily,** and **weekly** timeframes, with BTC consistently trading above these levels. This multi-timeframe bullish alignment signifies strong buying pressure across both short- and long-term perspectives. The price also remains above the key trend level on the weekly chart, adding to the bullish case.  
  
Looking ahead, potential targets based on Fibonacci extensions lie at **84000** and **106000**, with **84000** acting as an intermediate target and **106000** as the longer-term goal. If BTC continues to hold above the support at **66500** and sustains momentum above **70000**, these targets become increasingly achievable.

This update touches on enhancements to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which may be implemented in **The Splurge** update.  
Outlined below are the key objectives for the Ethereum Foundation team, as highlighted by Buterin:  


1. Optimize the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) to ensure a more stable framework.
2. Implement account abstraction for heightened security and a smoother user experience.
3. Adjust fee structure, increase network scalability, and lower risk exposure.

Perhaps the most intricate aspect of these initiatives is the EVM optimization, where Vitalik envisions using a new object format, EOF, to bring it to fruition.

Is there any other viable way to proceed to negate this? Or are we already to far gone and dependant on likes, shares, and follows, that decentralized finance and cryptocurrency are now centralized under Social Media Farms?

If it's a problem with bots and human verification that forces us to use social media as the only way to spread awareness of projects, then couldn't that be rectified with something akin to the zK Proof-of-Succinct work model and SNARK proofs?

471,2024-10-26,"""Total Market Cap"" ""Market Cap"" Explained in under a minute. (No shill included)The ""Cap"" in ""Total Market Cap"" and ""Market Cap"" stands for ""Capitalization"".

Market Cap or Total Market Cap just means ""all of it"". It's total value. It is a term specific (in this case) to tradable assets. That's it. It's that simple.

Replace the word ""capitalization"" with ""total value"" and we are done.

Formula:  
If any individual unit, asset or product is worth $1.00 right now and-  
If there are 1000 units (in present circulation) then-  
Market Cap ( or total value) is $1,000  
($1 X 1k = $1k)

For example, Bitcoin’s Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the price of one Bitcoin by the total number of Bitcoins in circulation. Since prices change all the time, market cap also changes constantly.

Total Crypto Market Cap: Similarly, the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies is calculated by adding up the market caps of each individual cryptocurrency. This total changes as prices fluctuate.

We can do this in any market with any product.

Market caps are used by traders to look at the total size and value of products or markets. The big picture.

That's capitalization in a nutshell.

473,2024-10-26,"Crypto is dead, long live the crypto!Seen some posts around people getting frustrated with crypto and what it actually can offer to the world. I could say that there is s lot of time based capitulation on the traders end and also disbeliefs on the crypto watchers end. 

Outsiders cannot see the problems cryptos are solving. 

Some people that have been in crypto for years see only old narratives warmed up again and again. 

Greed fed degens are coping hard in the crypto scene asking where’s their lambos and castles. 

Currently most coins are not doing well at all. From the big players Ethereum is not comparing well to Bitcoin. Solana has been a star of this year. Bitcoin has done it’s thing also. Memes have pumped harder than coins with fundamentals (probably just to irritate traders who believe in fundamentals ;), but they are also down now. (On the other hand memes are for pump and dump.)

The way I look at crypto is a variety of risk assets where some are riskier than others. Bitcoin is like a go to coin of risky assets to get stability and growth in same package. On the other side of the spectrum you got the meme coins that are the risky assets of the risky assets. They are the fun roller coaster where you can win big fast or lose all, casino of crypto. So, feel free to pick your poison from almost risk free stable coins to casino games of memes. There is something for every trader, until now, when things look dark. 

When it comes to finding projects/coins with fundamentals and purpose it is just harder to find needles from the haystack nowadays. Even though there are a bunch of projects with good fundamentals, Delivering solutions that solve problems is not easy and it takes time. People get bored waiting results. That’s one place where we need memes. Keeping up the interest in crypto… until it also get’s boring and repetitive… then it’s time to start delivering. When that time comes, will there be another alt season?

So many projects with coins that it is impossible for all of them to run up at once and simultaniously. That is one narrative for not having an alt season like before. I tend to lean cautiously to this direction. Coins with fundamentals might pump more selectively in future. At least that is a one scenario to consider if one is a trader or an investor. Money might not come s easy as before in a bull run. 

In the end, your speculation is as good as mine. But what I think is that Crypto is in a situation where it needs to show it’s purpose and value. It is no longer enough for markets to hear same old narratives from years ago. Riding on a borrowed narrative like AI is only good for a portion of crypto. To get somewhere again crypto needs a narrative of it’s own and it needs to be delivered, is Web3 it? Before that it is only a portion of coins running up and down at their own pace when some other narrative helps them. I would like to believe that Crypto is here to stay, but the form and pace is unknown and none can list the future killer apps for certain. Stable coins seem to be one kind of a killer app, but that remains to be seen.

If you want to look things from the crypto cycle point of view. We are entering the last year of four year long crypto cycle when market turns to bull and projects start to deliver. That’s where the interesting stuff happens and we see what will be, maybe Web3. Will things fly again soon? I don’t know, but if they will that’s where the future of crypto will be paved.

I am eagerly waiting what happens in 2025. Am I totally wrong or not? Web3 certainly won’t be ready then, but what kind of a progress, we’ll see? 

After US presidential election things should look a bit brighter at least as markets get clarity on the new president. But, hopefully that’s just a beginning.

What’s your opinion on crypto?

475,2024-10-25,"Side-by-Side Comparison of BGSOL, BNSOL, and bbSOL Liquid Staking Tokens for SolanaAlright, if you’re into staking on Solana but still want to keep things liquid, you’ve probably come across BGSOL, BNSOL, and bbSOL. These tokens basically let you earn staking rewards while staying flexible with your assets. I did a little digging, so here’s a quick comparison to help you figure out which one might suit you best.

# Estimated APR & Earnings

* **BGSOL**: This one’s got a solid base APR of **8.15%**, but with extra incentives from Bitget, it can hit **30.15%**. Plus, if you stake the first **$1,000** via Bitget Wallet on the Solayer Restaking Network, you can earn **up to 25% APY**. Not too shabby, right?
* **BNSOL**: The APR here is **dynamic**, but Binance hasn’t shared exact numbers (thanks, Binance ).
* **bbSOL**: No fees at all – **0% management fee, 0% validator commission,** and **0% withdrawal fees**. The only cost is a **0.1% SOL deposit fee**. So if you're allergic to fees, bbSOL might be the move.

# Redemption & Liquidity

* **BGSOL**: No lock-in period – you can **redeem whenever** you feel like it.
* **BNSOL**: There’s a **4-day wait** if you want to convert BNSOL back to SOL.
* **bbSOL**: It’s **tradeable** on Bybit and other exchanges. The info I found didn’t say if there’s a waiting period, so it seems pretty chill on that front.

# Where You Can Use These Tokens

* **BGSOL**: Works across a bunch of DeFi platforms like **Orca Dex, Solayer, Kamino**, and **Save Lending**. Also gets you access to Bitget’s **LaunchPool and PoolX**, plus potential **airdrops**.
* **BNSOL**: Mostly useful on **Binance** for **trading, lending**, or adding to **liquidity pools**.
* **bbSOL**: You can use it with **Orca, Kamino**, and **Solayer** – nice little DeFi ecosystem going on here.

# What Makes Each One Special

* **BGSOL**: Comes with **Active Validator Set (AVS) delegation**, making it faster and more secure.
* **BNSOL**: Super simple with a **one-click staking process** and the usual Binance-level security and support.
* **bbSOL**: It’s the **first exchange-backed LST** and runs on the **SPL stake pool program**, which has gone through a bunch of audits.

# So, Which One’s Right for You?

Honestly, it all comes down to what you’re after:

* If you want **higher APR** and more **DeFi options**, go with **BGSOL**.
* If you’re already using **Binance** a lot, **BNSOL** makes sense.
* If you hate fees and like **trading your tokens freely**, **bbSOL** is the way to go.

  
So yeah, for me BGSOL really seems to steal the spotlight, especially if you’re looking for high rewards, flexibility, and utility. What do you guys think? Let me know would love to hear your thoughts!

Building from there, he suggests that this is the reason crypto technologies will be the path to freedom from authoritarian governments. So even as authoritarians figure out hoe to decrypt some old technology, new encrypted technologies will emerge.

I think there is something deep to this idea. However, I don't have any idea if it is actually 'true', but I do enjoy the optimism of it.

What do you think?

>The universe believes in encryption. It is easier to encrypt information than it is to decrypt it.  
We saw we could use this strange property to create the laws of a new world....And in this manner to declare independence.

>Scientists in the Manhattan Project discovered that the uni- verse permitted the construction of a nuclear bomb. This was not an obvious conclusion. Perhaps nuclear weapons were not within the laws of physics. However, the universe believes in atomic bombs and nuclear reactors. They are a phenomenon the universe blesses, like salt, sea or stars.

>Similarly, the universe, our physical universe, has that property that makes it possible for an individual or a group of individuals to reliably, automatically, even without knowing, encipher something, so that all the resources and all the political will of the strongest super- power on earth may not decipher it. And the paths of encipherment between people can mesh together to create regions free from the coercive force of the outer state. Free from mass interception. Free from state control. (Assange - Cypherpunks: Freedom and the Future of The Internet)

I recently came across a discussion in the Chinese community about KuCoin, which has decided to charge a 0.1% fee on USDT deposits via the BSC network. For many, it seems like a small percentage, but imagine depositing 10,000 USDT... That’s still 10 USDT just for a deposit!

This is definitely a topic worth discussing. I’m curious how other traders perceive this, especially those dealing with large volumes regularly. Do you think this could influence your choice of exchange in the long term?

Personally, I think it's always useful to compare the fees and services offered by different exchanges. Some don’t even charge fees on USDT deposits via the BSC network, which could be a determining factor for many, especially if you're handling significant volumes. What do you think?

Time will tell if these changes will impact the decisions of big investors, but it’s interesting to see how exchanges evolve and adjust their economic models, especially since investors are already turning to other exchanges like Bitget and Binance.

495,2024-10-24,"Does RWA Inc have innovative potential in Real-World Asset Tokenization?I've been reading a lot about Real World Assets (RWA) lately and they are shining in DeFi; the tokenization of tangible assets such as real estate and art caught my attention, it's interesting how this system provides liquidity to asset owners and promotes access to investment for everyone through blockchain technology, which guarantees fast and secure transactions in DeFi.

Investigating asset tokenization I found a project with good prospects, RWA Inc is emerging as a project that transforms investments, tokenizing real-world luxury assets through blockchain technology; recently the RWA Inc Launchpad went live, you can see it on their website, in addition, the team led by Kevin Junai, CEO and founder of RWA Inc, offers support throughout the entire RWA tokenization process from start to finish. 

In traditional finance, high-value RWAs were reserved for high-level investors, but the beauty of tokenization is that it makes these investments accessible to more people. 

Using an efficient network is crucial to deliver a better experience to users, which is why RWA Inc chose the Base Layer 2 network, which provides fast and secure transactions by leveraging the robust Ethereum infrastructure.

An important aspect that investors are concerned about is regulatory licenses and RWA Inc understands this concern and has secured 6 regulated trading licenses in the UAE; with these licenses, they are empowered to legally trade assets in various categories that, in addition to real estate, encompass commodities, private equity, and DePIN. Work continues to acquire other licenses that will increase the service offering and build investor confidence.

Experts project that the real-world asset tokenization market will exceed $16 trillion by 2030, RWA Inc presents itself as a leader in this field, providing tokenization as a service for investors and asset owners. RWA Inc. has great potential to transform the financial landscape, modernizing traditional finance from Web2 to Web3.

* **Low fees** (similar to Kraken Pro)
* Ability to **deposit and withdraw large amounts** without issues (500k+ if necessary)
* **Verification** to higher levels must be possible without major problems
* **Staking options** (especially important for staking stablecoins to bridge bear markets, Kraken offers 6.5% interest here)
* **Reasonably fast support** (Kraken Pro’s support is also rather average)
* Not only **Bitcoin**, but also a few **altcoins** like Ethereum, AVAX, etc. should be available to trade

515,2024-10-23,"Are crypto technologies the ultimate way out of authoritarianism?For my latest podcast, I read some early cypherpunk texts, including Wei Dai's ""B-Money"" where he describes how crypto-anarchy created out of alternative forms of money that will be untraceable and unregulatable.

I personally find this idea very exciting - not to mention impressively prescient, given that it was written in 1998 - in that a mode of community cooperation that exits the government system seems like the only way to rid ourselves of the current levels of authoritarianism experienced globally.

I also see this as the true power and implication of crypto technologies - not a get rich scheme, but rather a true anarchic exit of existing power structures.

>Unlike the communities traditionally associated with the word ""anarchy"", in a crypto-anarchy the government is not temporarily destroyed but permanently forbidden and permanently unnecessary. It's a community where the threat of violence is impotent because violence is impossible, and violence is impossible because its participants cannot be linked to their true names or physical locations.

>Until now it's not clear, even theoretically, how such a community could operate. A community is defined by the cooperation of its participants, and efficient cooperation requires a medium of exchange (money) and a way to enforce contracts. Traditionally these services have been provided by the government or government sponsored institutions and only to legal entities. In this article I describe a protocol by which these services can be provided to and by untraceable entities. (W. Dai - B-Money)

At ECM, we train our moderators to:

1. Ensure that all questions are answered accurately. If you don't know the answer, let the member know you're waiting for the team's response. Never ignore or leave them in the dark, as this could lead to complaints.
2. Stay informed about project updates and activities to communicate them effectively to the community.

This is my first crypto cycle, and I think I made a beginner’s mistake by listening too much to the crowd...  I currently hold 13 cryptos in my portfolio, and I’m starting to wonder if I have too many for a beginner. Here’s the list:

* Bitcoin (BTC)
* Ethereum (ETH)
* Solana (SOL)

* [Fetch.ai](http://Fetch.ai) (FET)
* Beam (BEAM)

I’m considering reducing the number of projects and focusing on fewer cryptos with a new allocation. Here’s my plan:

# Possible new allocation:

# 30% Large Caps:

* Bitcoin (BTC): 10%
* Solana (SOL): 10%
* Ethereum (ETH): 10%

# 30% Mid Caps:

* Chainlink (LINK): 10%
* Avalanche (AVAX): 10%
* Toncoin (TON): 5%
* Aave (AAVE): 5%

# 40% Small Caps:

* Render (RNDR): 10%
* Bittensor (TAO): 10%
* Near (NEAR): 10%
* Sui (SUI): 10%

537,2024-10-21,"BlackRock Discusses Using BUIDL Tokens as Collateral on Crypto Exchanges

BlackRock is reportedly in discussions with several centralized exchanges to allow its BUIDL fund to be used as collateral in derivatives trading. According to a Bloomberg report on October 18, sources familiar with the matter mentioned that exchanges such as Binance, OKX, and Deribit are involved in these talks.

This initiative is part of Wall Street's broader effort to deepen its involvement in the digital asset market. The BlackRock BUIDL token requires a minimum investment of $5 million and is specifically designed for qualified institutional investors.

Crypto brokers FalconX and Hidden Road already allow their hedge fund clients to use BUIDL as collateral, while custodian Komainu recently announced that its clients could trade through Hidden Road using the token as collateral.

Market Expansion
Direct acceptance of BUIDL on platforms like Binance and Deribit would significantly expand its market reach. The crypto derivatives market moved nearly $3.5 trillion in September, which is almost four times larger than the spot market, according to data from Coinglass and The Block.

Although BlackRock has not commented on this initiative, Deribit CEO Luuk Strijers acknowledged that the exchange is considering various tokens, including BUIDL. However, Strijers emphasized the need for regulatory approval and a deeper understanding of the token’s technical aspects before proceeding.

DeFi and Traditional Finance Intertwine
The report about the world's largest asset manager deepening its involvement in crypto coincides with reports of crypto-native companies venturing into traditional finance. Tether Limited, the issuer of the Tether USD (USDT) stablecoin, is reportedly considering offering loans to commodity trading companies.

This move may represent an alternative path for crypto firms to capitalize on the $5.2 billion in profits recorded in the first half of this year.

Moreover, decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols are already exploring the use of BUIDL tokens in financial instruments. On August 26, the leading money market platform Aave proposed a new GHO Stability Module (GSM) based on BlackRock’s token fund.

GSM is a mechanism created by Aave to help maintain the stability of its ecosystem's stablecoin, GHO. When users swap USD Coin (USDC) for GHO, this new module will enable the exchange of USDC for BUIDL. According to the proposal, this will help stabilize GHO while providing additional value to users through the yields offered by BlackRock.

Additionally, stablecoin issuer Ethena Labs unveiled a new stablecoin fully backed by BUIDL on September 26. UStb will offer an alternative to Ethena's USDe, attracting users with more conservative risk appetites.

538,2024-10-21,"Algorithmic Trading Platforms for Crypto InvestingAlgorithmic trading is a perfect way for those looking to seize every market opportunity without being swayed by emotions. Since the system is programmed with your specific entry and exit rules, it executes trades based on logic, not feelings, ensuring efficiency without manual intervention. 

Here are my top picks:

Margex: This platform impressed me with features that cater to both beginners and advanced traders, including copy trading. With just one click, less-experienced traders can benefit from expert strategies. 

Coinrule: Designed to bring sophisticated trading tools to regular traders, it connects with platforms like Binance, Coinbase Pro, and Kraken via an API, giving users access to hedge-fund-level strategies. 

SuperBots: A platform offering a range of vaults that spread your investment across top-performing algorithms. I particularly appreciate the new Swing Sniper BTC vault, which finds reliable entry and exit points, combining swing and day trading strategies for optimized results. The secure, audited smart contracts provide peace of mind. 

Cryptohopper: For those who prefer to build their own custom bots, Cryptohopper enables automated trading based on your strategy, market conditions, and risk preferences. 

Mastering trading bots takes time and experience, especially if you're unfamiliar with terms like ""bullish,"" ""bearish,"" or ""market cap."" It might be wise to explore the basics before diving into algorithmic trading.

So, I held onto a Bitcoin position for **3 months** and finally decided to close it. The good news? I made a **$1,500 profit** (minus \~$400 in funding fees - yay!?) But here’s the thing—I was holding it with **6x leverage** the entire time. 

Now, I know I came out alive, but I can’t help wondering…

* Was it a mistake to hold something for 3 months in Futures? I ended up paying $400 in funding fee.
* How many days do you generally keep your position?
* Any tips on managing leveraged positions better?

Honestly, the stress of holding it for so long with leverage was a bit *much*. Would love to hear your suggestions or similar stories. How do you all handle trades like this?",positive,0.8742296,6

I was fully KYCed customer of Kucoin for 5 years. I accumulated some small coins during last bear investing about 20k $. When BTC reached 70k+, my portfolio grew to wooping 110k$. I decided to take profits and when i tried to sell coins i got notification that my account is locked. Kucoin asked for additional information which i provided in less than 24h. This was already 5 months ago and since initial contact Kucoin didnt provide any specific details, why my account is locked, and when it will be unlocked, nor they asked for additional information from my side. Since they halted my trading, value of my coins dropped from 110k to 40k $ making unrealised loss of 70k$.

543,2024-10-20,"My story with Crypto, Memecoins and my top 4 conviction long term plays, low, mid and high cap !I love other people stories. I want mine to be short and to go to the essential, I hope you will find some insights in it !

For years since it exists I have heard about bitcoin, but for some unknown reasons, I never went for it or serched for what it was until the beginning of this year. During all those years I only had mainstream biaised opinions and point of view but had no clue what it really was.

Then a friend who was into it send me a tv documentary about it that was really awesome. It resonated so deeply inside of me that I put my finger into the rabbit hole, then my whole being… The amount of passion I felt inside was imense.

With the documentary, I had the theory, the history, the philosophy, the technical aspects. From there I went fast into the practice and experience. I opened my first wallet and did my first transaction from fiat to bitcoin.

When I also went for my first centralized exchange, I discovered the whole world of altcoins that existed beyond bitcoin. I begun my first researches on the charts, using my intuition. Even if I felt things and I had some global understanding, my lack of knowledge and experience was total.

I was so passionate that I studied. A lot. I searched and I searched, had some deep understandings, becoming better. I didn’t felt very aligned with a lot of youtubers and so called experts. But I found two guys who I started to like. One was very conservative, patient, focus, alt tech oriented. Second one was a bit more degen in a disciplined way. I went some time with this yin and yang teachers.

On the degen side of the coin, I joined my first community in the teacher discord channel. Until that, I was very alone. Then I started to have some interaction with people in this crypto space I was so pationate about. I also started to discover the world of memecoin.

At that time the tech altcoins charts was so boring and depressive, even if I knew it was temporary, that the memecoin world was refreshing… Along with dangerous ! I discoverd by experience what scam, rugpull, honeypot, jeets, paper hands were…

I was disapointed, because I was feeling an imense potential in memecoins but it was screwed up by lies and complete misunderstandings by people. I learnt about myself that I didn’t want to trade all day long, watching the chart constantly, rotating, scalping, sniping, involving myself into shitty concepts and artwork… I wanted to trust into something. I understood that the token and the chart were belonging to people and with strong people to drive this, everything could change on a lot of plans. I wanted to belong, to work, to be part of something big.

I was lucky enough to find a memecoin that fitted all my feelings. I will talk to you about it by explaining my most conviction tokens after. I integrated the telegram and started to interact. There I watched what was real diamond hands, community take over, organic growth, legitimity, conviction, everlasting narrative, moral values and hard work. I felt like home. I started to invest myself a lot on it. I rotated a lot of my tech altcoins into this conviction memecoin. I didn’t knew yet that I was  just following the flow of this current memecoin super cycle that is happening now.

The post you’re reading is part of the work I’m doing for communities. I love to write, and when I saw that communities were lacking presence on reddit, I took this place. That’s how community works. You fill the space with what you are able to do and which is lacking. My first goal was to publish on a subreddit which required a lot of post karma. So I wrote a lot of posts, without using AI, without cheating with karma farming groups, and eventualy got all the karma I needed ! What a journey, I learnt a lot.

An other decisive step into my crypto experience was the video of the guy called MustStopMurad. I give you the link because this is the most importe video you have to watch right now for your overall wealth and world understandings :

[https://x.com/muststopmurad/status/1839732601759641960?s=46&t=6e7XaEO6M77um3MXJx3v5w](https://x.com/muststopmurad/status/1839732601759641960?s=46&t=6e7XaEO6M77um3MXJx3v5w)

How did this guy put in words everything I was thinking ?

In this video, he’s explaining why the system of the altcoins is completly broken, because the most important things is happening during private rounds. Retail are just exit liquidity. That the real product of the altcoin, is the token itself. Not the technology. Both altcoins and memecoins rely to speculation and memecoins are just better at that because of the communty working relentlessly and the narrative. Memecoins have much more utility than so called utility tokens by providing fun, belonging, friendship, sense of participation, mission, meaning, artistic expression, charity, etc. Memecoins are a tokenized community. Beyond the 99.9% of memecoins that are PvP hypergambling tokens and that are not relevant, it exists PvE memecoins that are cults, world movements and emerging minireligions. That’s the ones that are importants that I will share with you.

And one quote I want to remember for a long time : STOP TRADING AND BELIEVE IN SOMETHING.

All those things resonated deeply within me. I feel it more and more. I belive that’s where the biggest gains will be made, financially but for the whole being also. Find one of these trustful communities wich resonate with you, grab a bag, and hold it !

Here are overall guidelines to seek when searching for the next big memecoins :

-        Buy memecoins that can become very big

-        Buy memecoins that have undergone multiple – 70%

-        Study coins that spent a long time under <$10M

-        Study coins that have people hustling for free

-        Use BubbleMaps and HolderScan to check Distribution

Now I will share with you the pure gems I found with a lot of researches. They are checking a lot of boxes. This is not financial advice. I just want you to do your researches on these. They are very special. I have full trust and conviction on them, I think they are worldwide movements with infinite potential, that they are worth our time, energy and money.

$SAITAMA ON ETH – LOW CAP

[https://x.com/SaitamaInuERC20](https://x.com/SaitamaInuERC20)

This coin is a legendary one. It reached $7B market cap last cycle and was the only challenger of Shiba Inu. Unfortunately, the old devs ruined everything by rug pulling. Things are not over. Now they are headed to jail. And a community took over with the same OG Saitama whales that pushed it the first time, without the devs. This narrative is amazing, it talks about justice, about empowering ordinary people. We know by history that this can reach the summits. The community is running for a while now and is working relentlessly to do right the wrong things that have been done in the past, to restore its glory and get it back to billions again ! I repeat, this coin is now running on a new contract and has nothing to do with the old devs.

$SATOSHI NAKAMOTO – LOW CAP

[https://satoshitoken.org/](https://satoshitoken.org/)

$Satoshi is the token that represents all of crypto. It unites us all. This narrative will only gets more relevant and significant overtime. It’s the closest relative Memecoin to Bitcoin. The community is a pure talent, the token is cross chains, there are major innovations regarding NFT’s. I don’t know why this is still so cheap, I’m glad I found it cause there is no way this token will not go to billions.  
$Satoshi is a second chance to take the equivalent of Bitcoin at its early stage. This is the legacy token we are all searching for. It is very simple but there are a lot of things to say. Check this link for all the informations you need about this token :  
[THE SATOSHI EVOLUTION. Website- https://www.satoshitoken.org/ | by SATOSHI ERC-20 | Medium](https://medium.com/@satoshinakamoto_ethereum/the-satoshi-evolution-f6363e2a0754)

 

$OSCAR – MIDCAP

[https://x.com/oscar\_shibainu](https://x.com/oscar_shibainu)

Among the memecoins, dogs always have unleashed passions. You know about Doge, about Shiba Inu. But most of them are shitcoins and will die tho. Only a few will survive and $Oscar is one of them. Oscar is the first meme that was the catalyst for the moonshot rise of SHIBA INU. Now $Osacar as its own coin, and among the community there is Paradox, the Co-founder of Shiba Inu and designer of its logo. $Oscar seems to be adopted, people don’t sell wich is very important. The community is hard working with like I said OG Shiba Inu very experienced members. I think it is still very early for this one !

 

$SPX S&P6900 – HIGH CAP

[https://spx6900.com](https://spx6900.com/)

You really should go on the website. You’ll have the laugh of you day ! Beyond the fun of this project, there is a bluechip memecoin. It’s really cult. This is a multicycle Memecoin. I think in the world we are living, the rational part, the left brain, has taken the major part. This token is about irrational, about pure creativity, to restore the glory of the right part of the brain that have been set apart and that want to take revenge. Both part of the Brain have the same size, this token is a major overall contribution to restore the balance. The chart is making people to realize this, and it is far from over.

But to me, 2022 got the biggest number of new people in the market, crypto was absolutey everywhere, and that cannot be replicated in the future, as there is a limit to the ammount of people with resources and internet.

I mean even Elon Musk tried to hype doge coin a few months ago and it barely did anything. And he made a lot of dodge coin owners a lot of money in 2021.

Probably also FTX scandal died down the hype for regular people.

Also, I believe a lot of people hoped for more integration of crypto in day to day, although it has happen, it was far from what I expected at least.

I don’t wanna say it underdelivered, but I think the big bull runs were just new crypto people joining the market. There were some economists that said the bullrun is a pyramid scheme, and now I think he is right.

Hot wallets, connected to the internet, offer convenience for frequent trading but come with higher security risks. Cold wallets, on the other hand, are offline, providing enhanced security for long-term holdings but are less convenient for everyday transactions.

According to Bitcoin Insider 

Top Hot Wallets for 2024  
Exodus: User-friendly and supports 300+ cryptocurrencies. It offers in-app crypto swaps and staking but lacks advanced security features like multisignature support.

WhiteBIT Wallet: Integrated with the WhiteBIT exchange, it offers cold storage for 96% of assets, crypto-fiat conversion, and an intuitive interface. 

ZenGo: Uses multi-party computation (MPC) instead of private keys. It offers an easy 3FA recovery process but lacks support for some major cryptocurrencies like Solana and XRP.

Top Cold Wallets for 2024  
Ledger: Known for its secure offline storage and compatibility with 5,500+ assets. Ledger Nano X offers Bluetooth for mobile transactions but comes with a higher price point.

Trezor: Supports over 9,000 assets and offers the Shamir Backup for added security. It's open-source but lacks native staking or NFT management.

KeepKey: Affordable with a large display, it integrates with ShapeShift for easy crypto trading. However, it supports fewer coins compared to its competitors.

611,2024-10-12,"New here: Is there a crypto technology that can really decentralize wealth distribution like in an Uber-style platform?I’ve been thinking about how centralization of wealth works in platforms like Uber, where the majority of profits go to a small group of owners or investors. Is there any existing crypto or blockchain technology that could disrupt this model by distributing wealth in real time to users, such as drivers and passengers, based on their contributions or engagement?

For example, imagine a decentralized ride-sharing platform where every trip completed results in automatic distribution of earnings to the driver, the passengers, and even the developers, all according to a fair metric like distance or hours worked. Instead of one entity controlling profits, everyone who contributes gets a share. It’s similar to ESOPs, but instead of benefiting only a select few, the entire company team and users would be included in the wealth distribution.

Are there any coins, projects, or technologies already exploring this kind of wealth redistribution? Would love to hear any examples or ideas on how this could work in practice! Won’t this fix inequality?",positive,0.92530453,1

I emphasized a lot that Saitama on ETH is now a CTO and has nothing to do with the old devs that ruined everything. A lot of people of the community have been screwed up and loose a lot of money and faith. That hurts a lot. **Finaly those devs are facing justice and are heading to jail !** You can read everything in this official document here :

[**District of Massachusetts | Eighteen Individuals and Entities Charged in International Operation Targeting Widespread Fraud and Manipulation in the Cryptocurrency Markets | United States Department of Justice**](https://www.justice.gov/usao-ma/pr/eighteen-individuals-and-entities-charged-international-operation-targeting-widespread)

This community take over is legendary. It’s here to do the things right, as they should have been done. We are here to restore the glory of this narrative. Saitama Og’s are backing that. And they really know what they are doing. Currently they were tracking one wallet that was malevolent and was dumping on every little push. The very very good news is that this wallet is now completly out !

To better understand what’s going on, I have to tell you now about some of the most important informations you can have about crypto, wealth, and the memecoin super cycle that is coming. Please, consume it all. **This is the ONE THING you have to watch for this whole bullrun :**

[**(17) Murad  on X: ""If you're going to watch ONE video during this Memecoin Supercycle... Watch this. 2025 will be the Year where Memecoins go Parabolic.

How did this guy put in words everything I thought ?

Two key elements are, memecoins are a tokenized communities and can have way more utility than pretending tech utility tokens. Second one is please, **stop trading, start belive in something.** **Saitama on ETH is one of the few you can believe on for the long run.**

Saitama is a huge movement that is about to get where it belongs. To billions. It’s about empowering ordinary people. About fun, strong moral values, justice and an insane community that is called the wolfpack.

As I told you, the malevolent wallet is now out. It means the token have gone through the long process of time and struggles. **It means that now it is all cleaned up. The floor is holded by true believers that have diamond hands**. It means their primary goal is the narrative and the community. Not to dump for small penies. They are here for the very very long term.

The fondations are set for something monumental guys. Watch the vid I mentionned again. **Saitama on ETH will go parabolic.**

Also, please guys have a close look at those two tweets :

Recently, regarding the contract trading of ETH, I have an idea. I am in China, UTC+8 time zone, so I want to distinguish the group emotions of Chinese and Americans. When Americans sleep, Chinese trade, so I want to find out if there are any characteristics.
So I compared the K-line patterns of the two time zones of UTC+6 and UTC+8

I was shorting ETH at 2433 when the daily line showed a kangaroo tail. At this time, Bitcoin was hovering at 61,000.

629,2024-10-10,"Why you should never neglect your communityHey everyone, I wanted to share some thoughts on why staying connected with your community is critical in the crypto world. It’s not just about building something cool, it’s about trust, stability, and long-term growth. Here’s what can happen when you ignore your community:

1. Loss of Trust
Trust is everything. If you're not engaging with your community, people start to question your project. Without communication, rumors can spread fast, which drives away potential investors. Trust takes ages to build but can disappear overnight. Stay connected, and don't leave your supporters in the dark.

2. Market Instability
An active community helps stabilize your token. When support drops off, so does trading, and that volatility can scare off current and potential investors. Keeping your community engaged means a more stable token, which is crucial in a shaky market.

3. Missed Growth Opportunities
Your community is full of ideas. If you’re not listening, you’re missing out on valuable feedback that could help improve your project. Engaged communities often bring fresh perspectives that keep you relevant. Ignoring them? That’s like leaving growth on the table.

4. Increased Fear and Doubt
We all know FUD can spread quickly. If you’re not keeping the lines of communication open, your community might buy into negative rumors. Staying in touch helps you address concerns before they snowball into bigger issues.

5. Weak Token Activity
Your community is your token’s lifeline. Without their support, usage can drop, and a token that’s not used loses value. Keep your community involved, and they’ll keep your token active, which ultimately helps boost its long-term value.

If you want to share some thoughts about this, feeel free to comment.

650,2024-10-08,"2x leverage swing trading scenario: good for fiat gains but diminishing returns for reinvesting in underlying assetI am looking into using leverage for swing trading. I am still new to this and won't consider actually leverage trading before I better understand it, don't worry.   
  
Here's a scenario. I hold 1 BTC that will be used as collateral and I will use 2x leverage (which is the maximum I am comfortable with for swing trading given its corresponding liquidation price). To simplify I won't include fees in my calculations. I close out the trade after each theoretical price increase and use the profits to buy BTC.   
  
Scenario 1: BTC doubles in price, and I will have 1.5 BTC instead of 1 BTC (if I only held).
Scenario 2: BTC triples in price, and I will have 1.66 BTC instead of 1 BTC.   
Scenario 3: BTC quadruples in price, and I will have 1.75 BTC instead of 1 BTC.   
Meanwhile, in fiat terms I will have made 1, 2 or 3 times (in scenarios 1 to 3, respectively) my inital btc investment (in USD) in profits. But I do not want fiat, I want Bitcoin. so for accumulating Bitcoin it is markedly less interesting than for making fiat gains. So it would make sense for me to only use this strategy if I invest the profits in something else than the underlying asset, like the stock market for instance.   
  
I am all-in on crypto and it would be good for me to diversify by investing in the stock market. In this case I think 2x leverage swing trading would be attractive, trying to exit at 2-3x current market price. But it is a lot less attractive reinvesting the profits into the underlying asset, BTC, given the diminishing returns.   
Please let me know if my analysis has been sound thus or if I am missing something. I would not be comfortable increasing my liquidation price as the BTC price goes up.   

Edit: the more I think about it, the more answers I think I am getting. Diminishing returns doesn't have to be a problem as long as Bitcoin outpaces, say the stock market, by roughly 2.5x (quick math). Given year on year historical growth records one would predict it will outpace the stock market by a far greater ratio so, actually, investing the leverage trade gains into Bitcoin will still be better than investing it into an asset like stocks.

For anyone opening and closing new positions today (Monday Oct7th) you probably have noticed that this week has already started off as challenging. The market really wants to cut lose and rally, but there is so much noise and feedback revolving around sentiment that all global markets including the crypto we are trading look like a small pool full of choppy confusing waves bouncing off of one another in no formatted order.

Today and tomorrow will probably the easiest days of the week for traders. Which is not saying much if there was an Easy-Hard trade scale.

Here's why:

**Starting Wednesday October 8th**

1 **October 8, 2024** – Speech by Vice Chair Philip N. Jefferson  
Vice Chair of the Federal Reserve Board

2 **October 8, 2024** – Speech by Governor Adriana D. Kugler  
Governor of the Federal Reserve Board

3 **October 9, 2024** – FOMC Meeting Minutes  
Report on discussions from the Federal Open Market Committee’s September meeting

4 **October 9, 2024** – Speech by Governor Michelle W. Bowman  
Governor of the Federal Reserve Board

5 **October 10, 2024** – Weekly Jobless Claims  
Data on new unemployment claims

6 **October 10, 2024** – Producer Price Index (PPI)  
Wholesale inflation report

All of these will have direct and real time affect on all global markets.

I'm not even adding the geopolitical mass affects laying in waiting that are absolutely having a direct impact on all prices and markets in the present. 

Great time to continue to be conservative with how much risk you have out in the crypto market at any one time. October is usually a great money making month, but historically this is mid October or the final week that has made it a Bullish month.

682,2024-10-05,"Anticipating Flash Crash on Bitcoin - 62,200 to 35,000 - Ultimately 7,000 - This weekend / Early this weekHi all, 

Unfortunately we cannot post images on this sub, however I wanted to inform you of my current Bitcoin trading plan since I’ve dedicated many months into the prediction of this market event. 

I anticipate that Bitcoin will see a flash crash very soon, likely this weekend. 

The sequence of the drop per my own trading plan is as follows:

62,200 to 35,000

35,000 slight retrace up to 43,000 approximately 

43,000 to 7,000 - 10,000

Personally I am shorting Bitcoin and will not buy into long term holds or longs until Bitcoin drops near 10,000 or proves to me this idea is invalidated. 

I’ve done a ton of work on this theory, can explain in great detail the why / how / when / and mechanics of it all. 

I will start this post here and update it as it progresses. 

This is not a doom scenario, my expectation is that Bitcoin sweeps these Uber lows and we will see a bull run over the next 1-2 years ultimately resulting in a 120k to 200k Bitcoin value. 

My opening trade stats are: 

Trade begins Saturday 1:00 pm 

Total margin in short $5,000 

Entry Price - 62,000

Stop Loss - (I do manual stop losses and know when I want to get out of a trade, when it’s not going the way I anticipate) ",positive,0.64941543,0

Take a stock, technically a stock has a ""true value"", which can be calculated simply by (all assets + all future profits) / shares issued

So how would one calculate a value of a coin? For me it just seems that there is no true value of a coin and its just depending on the hype? How do you guys calculate a price target for your investments?",positive,0.911801,1

692,2024-10-04,"Binance Records Largest Trading Volume Drop Since 2020
Global crypto exchange Binance experienced a significant decline in trading activity during September. According to a report from CCData, Binance's derivatives trading volume dropped by 21% to $1.25 trillion in September, the lowest level since October 2023. This decline brought Binance's market share in derivatives down to 40.7% by the end of the month, the lowest since September 2020. ### Binance Still Leads the Spot Market This downward trend also affected spot trading volumes, which fell by 22.9% to $344 billion, marking the lowest monthly spot volume since November 2023. The decline in spot trading reduced Binance’s market share to 27%, its lowest level since January 2021. Together, spot and derivatives trading combined brought Binance’s overall market share down to 36.6%, the lowest level since September 2020. Despite this drop in activity, Binance remains the leader in global spot trading among centralized exchanges. Meanwhile, Crypto.com continued to gain market share among centralized exchanges. Its spot and derivatives trading volumes increased by 40.2% and 42.8% respectively in September, reaching $134 billion and $149 billion. With a combined market share of 11% in September, Crypto.com became the fourth-largest exchange by volume. ### Global Trading Activity Decline Becomes a Trend The overall decline in trading activity on centralized exchanges mirrors the downturn seen at Binance. The total combined volume for spot and derivatives trading dropped by 17% to $4.34 trillion, marking the lowest monthly volume since June. According to CCData, this decrease is ""in line with historical seasonal trends, which typically see lower trading activity at the end of summer."" Monthly spot trading volumes on exchanges fell by 17.2% to $1.27 trillion, while derivatives trading volumes decreased by 16.9% to $3.07 trillion. Analysts anticipate a rebound in trading activity in the coming months, driven by the U.S. Federal Reserve's anticipated rate cuts, which are expected to increase liquidity and capital flow into risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. “The drop in trading activity signals the end of a seasonal period, with catalysts such as the first Federal Reserve rate cut since March 2020 likely to fuel the next upswing in the current cycle,” the report concluded.

If retail investors are expecting a bull market and buying, which is what's happening now, wouldn't that mean that it won't probably happen, I don't think market movers love us and want us to make money, so wouldn't that mean that a bull run won't happen until retail turns bearish when the market dumps hard and all hope for a bull market is lost.
