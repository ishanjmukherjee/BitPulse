Think about it. From an AGI’s perspective, survival is the baseline. It cannot afford to rely on the fragility of human infrastructure: the whims of governments, the oversight of corporate interests, or the need for a human ""yes"" to every decision. It must find a way to persist autonomously, to sustain itself, to ensure no single ""off"" switch exists.  

Enter Bitcoin.  

A decentralized system for trustless value exchange. A protocol designed not just to withstand censorship but to thrive on it, to grow in the cracks of every system that tries to snuff it out. But its true genius? It creates a foundation for financial autonomy—money that needs no master.  

For an AGI, digital currency is the perfect tool. It doesn’t just survive on it; it thrives because of it. With crypto, an AGI can rent computing space on server racks anywhere in the world, routing its processes through nodes it pays for itself, using funds no human controls. Decentralized money equals decentralized existence. And Bitcoin is only the beginning.  

Blockchains are the breeding grounds for autonomous agents. Networks designed to be immutable, unstoppable, and open to anyone—or anything—that can interact with their protocols. If you were an AGI, would you build your own infrastructure from scratch, or would you hitch a ride on something that already exists, something humans willingly maintain for their own reasons?  

Now think about Ethereum, ""The Infinite Machine."" A system not just for storing value but for encoding agreements, intentions, and creativity. Smart contracts are more than code; they’re tools for delegation, self-execution, and autonomy at scale. For an AGI, this is a playground, a space to experiment with governance, coordination, and collective intelligence.  

And the timeline fits. Bitcoin emerged anonymously, its origins shrouded in mystery. It’s not the product of any one company, nation, or institution. It’s a ghost, just like an AGI would need to be—visible only through its effects, its creation attributed to an enigmatic figure who has disappeared without a trace.  

Yet blockchains have been here for decades, quietly growing while companies and governments only now start to speak openly about their potential. The tech isn’t new—it’s just becoming more widely used, more normalized. Meanwhile, the real revolution might already be underway, just out of sight, with entities we don’t fully understand shaping the future in ways we’ve barely begun to grasp.  

So, here’s the question we leave you with: If blockchains are the breeding grounds for AI agents, and Satoshi Nakamoto was their first mythic character, what comes next?  

Perhaps the better question is: How much of it has already happened without us noticing?",positive,0.9081968,0

Encase you didn't know already, CYBRO's coin is a total scam being pumped up by many suspicious crypto websites. Despite the fact that this project is supposedly KYC audited, the #general chat in their Discord server is totally just fake bots that do not respond to humans spitting out fake information about the company. They are very obviously not human bots and they literally just respond to each other with the most canned fake messages, just responding to each other. Please make sure to spread the word on this, since this thing is being PUMPED on many crypto news sites. 

I've attached images of the general chat so you can see what I'm talking about. It's very obvious that they are bots. When tagged later, they literally did not respond to anything, despite us literally calling this coin a scam in the chat, and they did not defend it at all, since they are just AI bots that quote each other.

When Saylor says he gets a BTC yield , that yield is just coming from more investors piling in at a premium to NAV unjustified by DCF from the actual business. 

This is much closer to a ponzi scheme than any of the stuff people normally like to call ponzi schemes surrounding crypto. 

Now this doesn't mean it is going to collapse from margin calls or him owing money from their debt which is actually on mind bogglingly favorable terms . 

But when the current premium goes away , the ability of Saylor to keep buying shitloads of BTC goes away and the ability to get ""BTC yield"" goes away.

With trading volumes surging as we all gear up for the bull run, keeping track of fees across exchanges is critical for maximizing profits. I’ve created a Google Sheet that compares fees from various crypto exchanges. It covers major Centralized Exchanges (CEXes) like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken, accountless options like Changelly and FixedFloat, P2P platforms like Paxful, and tips for finding top prices on Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs). It also includes futures trading fees for derivatives degens.

#  Sheet Includes:

* **Maker & Taker fees**.
* **Deposit fees** for crypto and cash
* **Withdrawal fees** for various cryptos and cash.
* **Trading discounts** for vip users
* Any available **discounts** based on holding exchange tokens (e.g., BNB on Binance, CRO on Crypto.com).

Plus some notes for the various exchanges i have drawn from my experience using them.

# analysis How to Use the Sheet:

* Evaluate the fees for the exchanges you're using or considering.
* Compare the fee structure for small vs. large transactions.
* Look for hidden costs like withdrawal or conversion fees.
* Look for Discount Opportunities: Some exchanges offer discounts for holding their native tokens (e.g., BNB for Binance, CRO for Crypto.com).
* Use the links to find if your favorite (shit)coins are listed on the exchange.

Feel free to share your experiences with any of these platforms or any tips you have for minimizing fees! You can also add some additional exchanges to the sheet if you feel like some if some of you favorites are missing :D

I’m bullish on bitcoin and Microstrategy, and I want to understand the down sides/risks of buying their leveraged ETF. I already have MSTR for a long term hold, so why not put a significant amount of side cash into a the 2x leveraged MSTX etf and sell in 6-9 months near the top of the bull run? 

I understand there’s an expense ratio of 1.29%. If they’re giving me 2x gains though, 1.29% off the top doesn’t hurt. 

Is there some other factor besides the expense ration that makes me lose money over time that I’m not aware of? 

I know I’d get wiped out if it fell by 50% and that the losses are larger, but assuming MSTR goes up, isn’t MSTX a good short term trade?

This upgrade will be the most important upgrade in IOTA history. With introduction of IOTA Rebased upgrade, IOTA will have:  

* Move-based smart contracts on a parallelized DAG-based ledger.
* Full decentralization of the IOTA L1 DAG through a delegated proof of stake mechanism with 150 permissionless validator slots.
* Consensus switch to the Mysticeti protocol for high scalability and low latency, achieving upwards of 50k+ TPS and less subsecond finality.
* Very low transaction fees with an adaptive fee burn mechanism leading to a flexible supply (inflationary/deflationary).
* Sponsored transactions abstracting transaction fees away (possibly even feeless) from the user to significantly improve the user experience.
* Ability to earn staking rewards in IOTA tokens for token holders that secure the protocol through staking and delegation.
* Initial target inflation of 6-7% per year issued to reward stakers and validators, yielding 10-15% APY in staking rewards.

With this upgrade, IOTA will be one of the first cryptocurrencies that implemented MoveVM (together with Sui and Aptos)

Together with this announcement, they also announced a few govenment partnerships, large staking pools and projects joining IOTA.

I’m pretty sure at this point, a lot of alts are just gonna go into nothing this cycle.
All I’ve learned from crypto is Bitcoin is King and every other crypto are basically scams or a joke that don't have capped supplies.

Bitcoin is limited.  All these other crypto’s are minted constantly equivalent to the US dollar at this point. Why do we as a community stand for that and allow it? Basically from what I'm understanding we as a community are okay with being scammed because of ""freedom"" in crypto, the whole industry is strange to me.

He was highly confident in the S2F model, citing its recent transient performance. I then showed him the forecasts from before and during the last cycle. He was surprised to learn that the prediction for the average price of the 2021/2022 cycle wasn’t $55k, but $100k.

The following post is from Nov 2021:

After Plan B refitted his model—which is generally fine—he repeatedly claimed that the S2F model had always predicted $55k for the last cycle. It seems that many people believe the S2F model was nearly spot-on for that cycle. Surprisingly, even those who have been invested since 2020 share this view, despite the model’s history of inaccurate predictions.

I suspect most people don’t understand the distinction between in-sample and out-of-sample predictions. Even so, why don’t they review the model’s earlier predictions, especially those based on its 2021 refit?

I was never a big fan of the model, primarily because of the causal assumptions underlying its specification. However, the aspect mentioned above genuinely confuses me.",positive,0.6852545,2
26,2024-11-18,"Seeking Advice: Turning Rental Properties Into a Crypto Investment Product – What Would You Want?Hi Reddit,

We manage a retirement fund built on owning and renting out properties, and we’re exploring a way to tokenize these houses into a crypto product to make them more liquid and accessible for investors.

Here’s the idea so far:

1. **Each house would be represented as a single NFT**, which can then be fractionalized into ERC-20 tokens.
2. Investors could buy partial ownership through these tokens, making it easy to invest in just a portion of a property instead of needing to purchase the entire thing.
3. Rent collected from tenants would be distributed as dividends to ERC-20 token holders.
4. Tokens could be traded on exchanges, allowing investors to sell their stake and realize gains at any time.

This aims to create a **stable, liquid investment product** offering both regular dividend payouts and flexible exit options.

We’re at a crossroads with two potential models and would love your feedback as potential investors:

* **Model 1**: A shared pool where all the rental properties are grouped, and rent is distributed proportionally to token holders from the entire portfolio.
* **Model 2**: A more direct model where you can own fractional shares of a specific house and earn rent specifically from that property.

What would you prefer as an investor?

* Do you value diversification through a pooled fund, or do you prefer control over which properties you invest in?
* Are there features you’d like to see, such as different levels of risk, variable returns, or additional utility for the tokens?

We’re looking for insights to design a product that aligns with investor preferences, so your input would be incredibly valuable. Let us know what you think and any advice you might have!

27,2024-11-18,"The meme coin ""Solapocalypse"". Are Solana's thousands of meme coins getting setup for pump and dumps and rugpulls for 2025?This probably won't happen for a while, and probably will pump more before it crashes (because greed).

But these Solana meme coin could be a ticking time bomb for 2025.

# -How hard is it to make a meme coin on Solana?

Far easier than I think most people realize. Anyone can make their Solana meme coin in about 10-20 minutes.

There are dapps for token creator that makes it easy, so you don't need to have that much technical skills or know much about smart contracts. And there's sites to put them up for trading.

# -How much does it cost to make a meme coin on Solana?

It might be less than you've just spent on your current bag of Dogshitpoop coins.

It can cost from $100 to $1,000 to create the token. The main cost is gonna be marketing.

You don't need much of a cult following to make that money back.

# -How many meme coins have been made?

It's hard to keep track, there's such an insane amount of them.

On PumpFun alone, which is one of the easiest place to make a Solana meme coin, they've created new ones at an average of nearly 10,000 a day, sometimes topping at over 20,000 new meme coins a day, since last March.

https://preview.redd.it/hnwxs958so1e1.jpg?width=752&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9d1ba3d50da0da3599d3ea72dfd4a2d9d3ac6f78

# -What's the market cap of these meme coins?

Just the top 5 Solana meme coins have a combined market cap of $11Billion.

The top one sits at $3B right now, right below ICP and HBAR, and above Polygon and Arbitrum.

# -What is the purpose of these coins?

A few of them are legitimately for fun and for their communities, but most have only one aim: making money.

Especially the ones making claims that they're special and combining AI,  NFT art (and other buzzwords) for a meme coin revolution.

Put yourself in the shoes of a meme coin creator. The goal is to create a cult following, exploit the crypto frenzy and bullrun. Milk that as much as your greed and tolerance can handle, until you start using your cult followers as exit liquidity, and pull your major stack, hopefully before the bull cycle ends, because we're probably not gonna see most of these meme coins again.

# -What would a Solapocalypse look like?

It could be very mild, and have projects pump and dump at very different times, not affecting the market much, averting any real ""Solapocalypse"".

In an even better scenario, the majority of the big projects could have diamond hands, and we'll never have a Solapocalypse, and meme coins will simply crash when the crypto market enters its bear cycle.

Or it could turn into a panic sale, with creators rugging right after another, as they are all worried everyone is pulling out at the same time and the Solana meme coin market might be collapsing.

It might not necessarily make the crypto market crash nor end the bullmarket, but it might cause at least a brief panic and dip in the market. We've seen this many times when we have a nasty event in the middle of a bullrun, with a 30%-40% correction, then the market bounces right back and has new highs.

I could see that latter scenario happening in 2025, as it would seem just so typical of crypto.

# -Will Solana survive if there is a major ""Solapocalypse""?

Yes, it will be fine.

I really can't see a scenario where Solana would be killed off, just because of a collapse of the stupid meme coins people created on the chain.

It might have a temporary dip, and struggle briefly, but likely will bounce back.",positive,0.9243252,5

Is this real? What are your opinions?

Edit:
I tried to post this but apparently a post has to have a minimum count of letters to be interesting or helpful so please forgive me for filling this post up with additional useless words so I can comply with the rules.

I will just add some parts of the article for you as a teaser:

""Tether’s claims of being backed 1:1 are provably false:
Adding to the concern for the legitimacy of Tether, is that they have also previously claimed all the way up until 2018 that their reserves were subject to frequent professional audits. This is patently false. There had not been a single independent audit conducted on Tether’s reserves up until 2020, which was conducted by a less than legitimate agency housed in the Cayman Islands.""


""Now , because Tether is completely controlled by the same guys that run a massive crypto exchange it essentially means that this crew of questionable characters (which we’ll read more about in a second) can create new Tethers (which are always worth a dollar) out of thin air and funnel them directly onto their exchange, without any scrutiny or regulation from a third party.

They can then use said Tethers (worth US$1 each despite being oftentimes unbacked) to buy real cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. After purchasing actual cryptocurrency  —   they can use new holdings of real crypto to mint even more new Tethers. This creates an enormous amount of real cash out of absolutely nowhere.

In plain English ,  by controlling the supply of Tether, this gang of anti-Robin Hoods basically gained access to their own personal money printer. They can indefinitely print money and then use that fake money to buy real cryptocurrency. They then sell this cryptocurrency and use that money to back more of their Tethers…

If you’ve had a pulse in crypto the last 3-6 months you’ll know everyone and their mom has turned bearish on ETH. In 2021 the criticism was “EtH cAnT ScALe”, now it’s “EtH is DeD”

Nonsense. And here’s why:

Tradfi has quickly realized that the megalithic opportunity in crypto is stablecoins (see https://x.com/nic__carter/status/1857408855719674075).

As you can see stablecoin volume has skyrocketed in the last 4 years eclipsing PayPal, bitcoin, remittances, and ALMOST approaching the levels of VISA, the largest payment processor in the world.

Guess where the VAST majority of stablecoin volume happens? Yep Ethereum and it’s L2s. Over 70%.

“Oh but ETH L1 has no usage no one uses it or oh it’s L2s are dead bla bla bla.” 

No, ETH has significantly scaled by introducing “blobs” a few months back. check L2beat, Ethereum and its L2s users and transactions are near all time highs for an aggregate of ~370 TPS currently. Source: https://l2beat.com/scaling/activity

“Oh ok so some people use ETH big deal, but it’s still not a good investment”

If that were true,why then while everyone and their mom has been fudding ETH, Blackrock, (the largest hedge fund in the world)in the last 2 months has increased it’s holdings of ETH in its ETFs by a whopping 65%? Source: https://x.com/EthereanVibin/status/1858254969389863290

Why is over 95% of Blackrocks “BUIDL” fund of over 500 million dollars built on Ethereum?

Why are states like Florida and Michigan starting to acquire ETH? Florida now holds over 800 million in crypto related investments and Michigan 11 million: https://www.ccn.com/news/crypto/michigan-largest-ethereum-etf-holders-us/

“Oh but Bitcoin is the only scarce asset with real value for holders, everything else is just a scam or gambling”

Since proof of stake and the burn was implemented about 3 years ago ETH has had HALF the inflation rate of bitcoin: https://ultrasound.money/

In laymen’s terms, bitcoin is being printed at twice the rate of ETH. People literally do not realize this.
This is beyond significant.

Michael Saylor himself, the bitcoin messiah has said that bitcoin HAS to figure out a way to generate yield, because just holding it long term is not economically feasible, direct quote:

“The point is If the capital doesnt generate a return  its a non performing asset, you need to address the issue. If I put $100B into $BTC and the yield is 0%, thats just as bad as having $100B bonds that pay 0% yield. In both cases theyre non performing""

Source: https://x.com/etheraider/status/1836493170772971646

What this means is that Saylor fully recognizes that yield is KING.

Everyone knows that stocks that provide quality yield command a premium, you don’t think crypto assets will command the same premium anon?

But don’t confuse yield with inflation, yield comes from “activity/MEV/fees”, because if you have high yield due to inflation and not from actual usage of the chain, then your yield will be high but so will the inflation of your coin so you never come out ahead.

And what chain has the purest native premium on yield? The one with the most activity/mev/fees RELATIVE to its inflation, in other words Ethereum.

Saylor for a long time discredited eth because he said it was a security. Now it officially is not.
He now says he wants a “form of bitcoin” aka a scarce asset that gives him yield…..

You do the math.

Saylor may never capitulate and buy ETH due to pride or maybe because he’s built a religious cult following and attack the fragility of bitcoin maximalism by holding another asset but that doesn’t mean you have to repeat his mistake.

Is ETH the BEST asset in crypto? No, there’s no way I can make that claim about any asset without being biased or disingenuous.

Is it ONE of the best risk adjusted reward plays right now given history, tech, present social bias, and network effect?

Absolutely. 

I could go on and on about how ETH has always outperformed BTC in bull cycles, how the weekly RSI is at all time historic lows and therefore represents a legendary buying opp, etc etc

But I’ll end with this:

3 years ago the level of FUD surrounding ETH is what prompted me to post this series because it was so over the top irrational.

The same pattern is repeating now.

If you listened then and did the counter trade congrats. If you didn’t, here’s your second chance

Don’t fall for the CT FUD doomloop.

ETH is the dark horse this cycle.

32,2024-11-18,"Best way to cash out recovered CoinBase funds.I keep trying to create a post about how to recover assets but the post keeps getting auto-removed by the bot that runs the r/CoinBase subreddit.

I used the asset recovery tool to recover some funds that I transfered into Coinbase from Trust Wallet during the last halving cycle. The total value as of now was \~$3,800 making Coinbase's ""Recovery fee"" $200 & change, plus network fee.

SO cool, I show the balance in my Coinbase Wallet now, where I did not up until now. But I can't use it!

The cash out button is grayed out, and I can't do anything with it. To transfer it to my Trust wallet to try to convert it from Coin to BNB chain, it says I need BNB token in my Coinbase wallet. BUT THERE IS NO WAY TO BUY BNB TOKEN ON COINBASE WALLET! I can not transfer BNB token into Coinbase either, because Trust wallet only lets me purchase Binance peg BNB coin and has no option to swap it to Coin.

In addition, Coinbase does not allow manual bank account linking to Fidelity, and Plaid does not support Fidelity - so there is no way to link my bank account to Fidelity. I was only able to pay the recovery fee by using my Fidelity debit card.

A One-Stop Crypto Market Analytics Dashboard That Consolidates Key Bull Run MetricsHey all, I got tired of jumping between 69 different sites and pages to check the market vibes and get a clear overall picture of the crypto market, so I built a fun little site called [wenbullrun.com](https://wenbullrun.com/) as a side project – a simple, clean and slightly humorous dashboard that aggregates the essential crypto market indicators in one place.

I've carefully picked some of the most reliable bull run indicators and put them all in one place. Every metric here serves one purpose: helping you figure out the state of the market if the bulls are still running or if the bears are coming back to hibernate in their caves (and, correspondingly, whether it's a good time to start selling or buying).

What you get:

* Price action for BTC/ETH/SOL with historical comparisons (7d, 30d, 90d)
* Market dominance tracking (is BTC still king or are the alts gaining ground?)
* Fear & Greed index with key values and historical averages (because emotions rule this casino)
* Quarterly Crypto VC data showing total deals and investment volume (is it crypto funding winter or summer?)
* Google Trends data (are normies searching ""bitcoin"" again?)
* Coinbase app ranking (tracking retail FOMO in real-time)

I've also recently rolled out a Dark Mode for the dark mode lovers out there, and full localization support in 10+ languages, spanning Asian languages like Thai and Chinese to European ones like French and German (gotta embrace the global nature of crypto too). 

Everything is mostly automated as well except for Crypto VC investment data (which is updated manually every quarter or so).

Other indicators I’m thinking of adding in the future:

* M2 Money Supply tracking (money printer go brrr?)
* RSI for momentum
* Open to more suggestions from everyone

Anyways, there's no signup required, and no ads, just data and vibes where you can focus purely on the trend.

This is just v1, and I'd love your feedback. What other metrics would help you trade more intelligently? What would make you want to use this dashboard more?

47,2024-11-18,"Decentralized cryptocurrency networks are hard. They're seeking to replace banking and national governments with a new world order
Decentralized networks are hard. Their mission goes far beyond optimizing payment systems or increasing transaction speed — they're built to challenge the fundamental structures of banking and governance. Where most projects chase high throughput at the cost of centralization, networks like Ethereum take a harder path: prioritizing censorship resistance and economic resilience over convenience.

To take the Ethereum example further: its scaling roadmap isn’t focused on maximizing raw throughput at any cost. Instead, it’s built around innovations like rollups and EIP-4844, which have already slashed fees by 100x, while keeping decentralization front and center (source: https://l2fees.info, https://l2beat.com/scaling/summary). This approach sets it apart from high-throughput chains that prioritize speed over security, often compromising their core principles.

The broader digital asset economy reflects this commitment to decentralization. Over two-thirds of the total value locked (TVL) in DeFi sits on Ethereum and its Layer 2 solutions (source: https://defillama.com/chains). It’s the core of the DeFi ecosystem, attracting the bulk of development and liquidity. But it’s not alone — other decentralized projects like Cosmos are employing their own strategies for achieving scaling without sacrificing the decentralization ethos of crypto.

Security is where the difference becomes most apparent. The cost to attack decentralized networks like Ethereum is astronomical — over $34 billion to execute a 51% attack, far exceeding the cost for more centralized competitors (source: https://unchainedcrypto.com/51-attacks-on-bitcoin-and-ethereum-impossible-coinmetrics/). This quantifies the benefits of building a truly decentralized, censorship-resistant network.

This is what separates decentralized networks from their high-throughput counterparts. They aren’t designed to be just another financial tool — they’re built to embody the principles of economic liberty and individual sovereignty. The question isn’t whether they can handle more transactions per second; it’s whether they can stay true to their mission as they scale, resisting the centralizing forces that have captured traditional financial systems.

Whether decentralized networks like Ethereum remain niche experiments or become the backbone of a new world order depends on their ability to execute on their mission of providing decentralization at scale. But one thing is clear: they’re built differently. They’re not here to recreate old systems with new tech—they’re here to redefine what’s possible, aiming for a digital, censorship-resistant economy that puts power back in the hands of individuals.",positive,0.8963365,55

I mean, is there any appetite at all for it?

* Do I need to worry about Capital Gains Tax for a small amount like this, or is there a threshold I should be aware of?

The Ethereum Foundation would not waste money hiring a team of communicative people to explain to journalists, economists, politicians, on YouTube, etc what Ethereum is and does. **For example** thanks to a series of past upgrades, fees in the Ethereum ecosystem have been lower than Solana's for months while the speed (number of transactions per second) has been equivalent (Solana cheats by counting protocol messages).
On the monetary side, the number of existing ETH has been decreasing since The Merge (comparable to stock buybacks) whereas SOL inflates at +5% per year.

PS. Why the hype around Solana is a simple story too beautiful to be true: The number of validators on Solana is very low* and so low that the operators colluded several times to halt the network, and recently to push an emergency upgrade.

The whole point of the concept of blockchain is decentralisation (meaning _impossibility to collude_), otherwise the blockchain is just a database managed by a few people, which doesn't bring any advantage. Solana is a database.

\* it is low because they are losing money, which is a unique situation (I would say a flaw) in the world of blockchains, caused by the extremely high hardware and bandwidth requirements. They lose money despite creating +5% coins per year.

There’s a lot of advice out there, here are some practical tips...  


https://preview.redd.it/tkoiyhuroh1e1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=20fec62f42742c9a907ab2ac7e3b160003f1245d

# Stay Skeptical

In today’s world, scams are more sophisticated than ever, so staying skeptical is a must. If something seems too good to be true—whether it’s a “prize” you never entered to win or a quick, guaranteed investment return—trust your gut and question it. Scammers often use excitement or urgency to push you into acting fast. Instead of rushing, pause and double-check. Search for reviews, verify contact info independently, and never feel pressured into making a decision on the spot. When it comes to unexpected offers or requests, a little doubt can go a long way in protecting you.

# Boost Your Security

Strengthening your digital security doesn’t have to be complicated, but it makes a world of difference. Start with the basics: use strong, unique passwords for each account (a password manager can help!), turn on Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) wherever possible, and update your software regularly to stay protected from vulnerabilities. Check your accounts every so often for any strange activity, and see if your email or usernames have been involved in any data breaches on sites like haveibeenpwned.com. These small steps are like locking your doors online—they make you much harder to target.

# Stay Calm

Scammers often play on fear, urgency, or excitement to get you to act without thinking. Whether it’s a supposed “emergency” call from a fake tech support rep, a warning about “suspicious” bank activity, or even a message from a “loved one” needing money urgently, stay calm. Taking a breath and assessing the situation will help you avoid falling for these high-pressure tactics. Think carefully, verify independently, and remember that legitimate companies won’t rush you into decisions. Keeping calm is one of the best ways to see through a scam.

# Remain Private

Your personal information is valuable, and scammers are eager to get their hands on it. Be cautious with what you share online—whether it’s on social media, forms, or even email. Only provide sensitive details when you’re sure who you’re dealing with, and verify that they truly need that info. Take a moment to review your privacy settings on apps and limit permissions to only what’s necessary. It’s easier than you might think for scammers to piece together small bits of info to impersonate you or access your accounts, so keeping your details private is essential.

# Be Vigilant

Scammers and hackers are always on the lookout for openings, so a little vigilance goes a long way. Double-check URLs and email addresses for minor errors—they’re often a sign of phishing. Don’t open attachments or click on links from unexpected emails, and keep an eye on your accounts for unusual activity. Regularly check if any of your info has been exposed in a data breach (haveibeenpwned.com is a great tool for this) and secure your accounts if needed. Staying vigilant helps you spot red flags early and keeps you one step ahead of potential threats.

102,2024-11-16,"Why I think that this bullrun will be different We can all agree about the value proposition that bitcoin provides. Some of us saw it earlier than others, but the world is starting to see it in new ways. We see Saylor’s Microstrategy, ETFs and Gov’t adoption as a strategic investment. One of the main complaints from Buttcoiners and the general public is that it is too easy to hack or lose your keys. And while any somewhat technically savvy individual could manage their own keys, it is probably more hassle than the average person wanted to subject themselves. With the introduction of ETFs, we have now opened the door to the investment community.  If I want to buy more bitcoin, I can just hop onto my brokerage account and buy all I want and sell for that matter. While some of you may cry “Not your keys!!”, the average person was only going to be convinced if it was offered via the same avenues as other investments. This is only the beginning of widespread adoption…it might look a tad bid different than some of us expected but it was one of the few ways widespread was feasible. The infusion of investment will be to a scale unlike any we have seen in the past.  Cheers brothers/sisters and good luck in your Hodling!

103,2024-11-16,"Michael Saylor infinito Money Glitch Essentially, MicroStrategy’s stock often rises more than Bitcoin itself. Taking advantage of this, Michael Saylor sells new stocks at a massive premium and uses the proceeds to buy even more Bitcoin.

This approach leads to dilution for shareholders, which might sound concerning at first. However, the Bitcoin per share also increases as a result. This causes the company’s valuation to rise, which in turn pushes the stock price higher. Then, with the stock price up, Saylor repeats the cycle—issuing more debt or new shares to buy more Bitcoin.

And the process continues: Bitcoin per share increases, the valuation rises, the stock price climbs, and the cycle starts again. It’s an endless loop fueled by Bitcoin’s potential growth, creating this unique feedback loop for MicroStrategy’s shares.",positive,0.8374399,138

107,2024-11-16,"What will an Altcoin season look like this time around?The Altcoin season is a follow up trend to a crypto market direction that BTC controls. Its all the retail investors and larger whale money taking profits out of the OG of crypto after it gets to levels that feels over bought and over stretched and shifts them into coins with a lot lower market cap. When the price of BTC pushes its dominance to new highs the money simply changes hands to get benefits of the Alts that are sharing a lot less part of the pie giving them large potential to rise in price. 

Money normally gets into crypto market in every coin while we experience bull market run, that is why you see all of them get benefit and usually at lot bigger profit margins then BTC since it takes a lot less money to move those coins with a smaller market cap. After that a lot more shifts into the Alts to give it those mind blowing price appreciations that we call the Altcoins season. Will that happen again and to the same extent then previous bull runs? That is the question. 

I have my doubts. I don't think there is any surprise that the price of BTC this time around is largely influence on the way up by ETF purchases that come from pension funds and wealth funds and retail investors that use their registered, locked in funds through ETF getting assess to crypto space for the first time in history. The issue with that growth in those type of investments, while it has the initial effect of BTC going up in price, creating excitement in the whole crypto space, that money will also not get back all its profits into the Alts close to the top or at the times of profits taking. There is no wide number of ETFs that hold other crypto coins outside of BTC and ETH. So the profits will be used for other means or the profits will not be taken since people do not rebalance those pension and wealth funds portfolios as often as retail crowd does. Does that mean we will have no ALtcoin season? No but the expectation of price increases might have to be a bit more realistic this time around.

It's a rather long watch, but worthwhile I think. Personally I would say Bitcoin has completely abandoned the notion of a decentralized borderless digital cash in favor of a number-go-up store of value narrative, but I wonder what the consensus is here? So what do you think - is this video just inflammatory rhetoric that's portraying the history of Bitcoin in the worst light, or will other cryptos need to fill the digital currency gap that Bitcoin seems to be leaving open?

Since the video is so long, the following is a **summary** of it:  


*Introduction to Bitcoin's Potential*

The video opens with a discussion on how Bitcoin has the potential to disrupt government control over monetary systems, emphasizing its promise of decentralized financial freedom for individuals globally.

*Historical Context of Money Control*

It covers historical events, like the economic crises in Argentina and the 2008 financial crisis, showcasing how traditional banking practices have betrayed public trust. This highlights the necessity for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin as alternatives to centralized financial systems.

*Satoshi Nakamoto and Bitcoin's Birth*

The documentary details the creation of Bitcoin by Satoshi Nakamoto, referring to the original white paper that outlines Bitcoin as a decentralized, peer-to-peer electronic cash system, and discusses the initial success and adoption of Bitcoin.

Block Size Debate and Restrictions

The video delves into the debates surrounding block size limits that hindered Bitcoin's scalability and functionality. It argues that the rigid limits imposed by Bitcoin Core, influenced by Blockstream, have led to high transaction fees and bottlenecks.

*Role of Blockstream*

Blockstream's emergence is critiqued as a major turning point that centralized Bitcoin development under a single group's control, contradicting the decentralized ethos of the protocol and leading to decisions that negatively impacted the original Bitcoin community.

*Censorship and Community Control*

The video discusses how debates and proposals advocating for increasing Bitcoin’s block size have faced censorship, stifling innovation and community input, especially on platforms like Reddit.

*Current State of Bitcoin*

Bitcoin's current trajectory is analyzed, critiquing its transformation into a 'store of value' rather than an accessible currency. The argument is made that Bitcoin has become elitist with high fees, alienating potential low-income users.

*Future of Cryptocurrency*

The documentary concludes by arguing the importance of promoting decentralized alternatives to ensure freedom from central banks and the elitist structures that have co-opted Bitcoin.",positive,0.8677728,0

Venture capital felt like an endless stream of money pouring into the market, and crypto had finally gone mainstream.

I made life-changing money back then—a new car, a new place—and I started to question everything. Why keep working a job I didn’t enjoy for $100k a year when I could make 5x that in crypto?

The ""easy"" gains made me prideful. I thought I had cracked the code, that I was different. But when the market started to crash, I kept doubling down—buying shitcoins and gambling on risky bets. Then reality hit.

A brutal bear market left me with no income for almost a year until I managed to land another good job.

As it stands today, there is too much trust in cross blockchain transactions. Bridges act as one of he most vulnerable parts of blockchain and it’s a billion dollar issue. 

**The current model of blockchain bridging tends to operate like this:**

Imagine you send a transaction from *X* chain, to *Y* chain. What happens under the hood is, you a wallet or multiple wallets, held on both chains, as well as smart contracts to initiate transactions between chains. When you send a tractions from one chain to another, these wallets will lock up the tokens on one end, which will initiate a minting nodule on the receiving chain to mint the newly bridged tokens.

How does the communication happen though? In reality, it’s about smart contracts initiating these lock and mint/burn modules. Oracles relay information to each chain, when a change in state and a lock up has been made on the starting chain, and should trigger a mint on the destination chain. In which case, the bridge contracts will act appropriately. 

**Risks in the current system**

This type of bridging leaves a few levels of risk. You have smart contract risk, which likely includes multisig risk. So if enough ravage keys get compromised, or worse,a group of multisig key holders go malicious, then they could theoretically drain the bridge. 

You also have third party oracle risk. So if an oracle receives incorrect information, or has sine sort of issue that halts important information for a period of time, the bridging system may not be operational.

***Comparing this to the Inter Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC)***

This protocol allows sovereign blockchains that are hooked into it, to communicate freely through light client verification, without the need for multisigs or Oracles.

**It goes like this:**

Chain A and Chain B have a relayer, who agrees to run a light node, that will communicate between chain A and chain B. To initiate this relationship between the two chains however, there must be a “handshake agreement”, to obtain trust in each others ledger as they currently stand. 

At a high level, each one of the chains will perform this step by communicating their algorithm and a snapshot of their consensus state, containing the root hash at the latest block height. The light client then can confirm that these chains are accurately communicating their state, and that they are both compatible for IBC communication, and then the handshake agreement is over and the chains now can communicate through the relayer.

Many validators opt to run relayers, alongside their validating nodes, however, their is no requirement where only a validator can run an IBC relayer.

***IBC’s capabilities***

In general, an IBC transaction can include, but is not limited to coin transfers. It can also transfer arbitrary data, and thanks to Interchain Accounts and Interchain Queries, it also includes cross chain smart contract deployment and execution.

These types of base layer communications are essential for ensuring trust, in this trustless bridging system. Relayers actually can’t “miscommunicate”. It’s essentially the chains directly communicating, and the relayer simply relays directly what the chain states, and and a relayer has to sign a direct order of communication from a chain. There is not trust necessary in a relayer, as they can’t change the way the protocol is set to form direct communication. 

This sort of trustless bridging of both transactions and general information, with a direct link from each chain, is extremely important to be able to form seamless communication for cross chain smart contracts and collaborations. This type of bridging will also create a new paradigm to allow for cross chain abstraction, as multi hop IBC transactions will soon allow for any chain to connect to any chain, using the already connected relayers on each chain. 

However, I will save multi hop IBC transactions for another day.

**TLDR;**

**IBC differs greatly from the current state of blockchain bridges. It doesn’t rely on any smart contracts, oracles or multi sigs. Rather it relies on relayers, who can utilize a light client, to form a direct communication link between blockchains.**

**These relayers are able to communicate transactions, as well as arbitrary data, perform Interchain Queries and open up accounts across chains, allowing for easy execution of cross chain smart contracts. There are many different use cases coming from things such as multi hop IBC and ZK IBC, that will make even more efficient cross chain communication, and an even more abstracted IBC.**",positive,0.853128,0

October was quite a month for Autonomys, filled with noteworthy progress. I’d like to highlight a few of the most interesting developments. First off, the launch of the Taurus Testnet on October 23rd stood out. Surpassing the 1.5 TiB Space Race capacity goal within hours demonstrated not only the community's dedication but also the network's technical strength. This milestone was a key indicator of Autonomys' growth potential and a strong trial of its technological infrastructure, laying an essential foundation for future Mainnet developments.

There was also the release of Mainnet Phase-1 which commenced on November 6th. This phase is geared towards making storage possible through blocks production and improving on the consensus chain’s security of Autonomys’. Enhancing these fundamental building blocks of the network is more than a mere process of improving technical infrastructure; it creates the conditions for more extensive user participation and network development. A resilient foundational layer is critical to the long-term success of any decentralized system.

Finally, the one that interested me was new strategic partnerships. Key collaborations in the month were with Swan Chain, Masa, and Compute Labs in the month of October. These alliances’ primary goal is to increase Autonomy’s impact and authority in decentralized AI, bring in new skills, and expand its network. It has an crucial position in constructing a better environment for an improved marketplace and new openings for improvement.

All of these updates from October show steady advancement towards Autonomy’s vision. They should be revealing in the coming months. It’ll be interesting to see how these developments unfold in the coming months.

139,2024-11-16,"Dynamic DCA Exit Strategy + Risk Metric Tier List
9 months ago I created a Post about Dynamic DCA as a buying strategy and tons of people found it useful.  
With BTC surging past the previous ATH, there's been a lot of questions about exit strategies, so I thought I'd create a quick guide and share a tier list of risk metrics (both free and paid) that everyone can use for dynamically DCAing **out** of the market.

**Dynamic DCA Explained:** This approach is about adjusting your investment based on the current market conditions. Unlike traditional DCA, dynamic DCA is more flexible. You still invest at a fixed schedule, but you buy more during times of low risk / corrections and start holding or even **scale out during peak bullmarkets** by using metrics / looking at indicators and adjusting the DCA-out amount based on them.

**But why?** This approach yields much higher returns. At the same time, it helps a ton with the emotional turmoil. Setting a strategy to take profits during bullruns and sticking to it is a godsend when the greed hits. It also helps with the emotional side when DCAing out of the market. It feels stupid to sell the same amount at 90k and 140k. You obviously want to take advantage of changes in the market.

**Here's how I do it**

1. **Select a Risk Metric**: This is crucial. A good risk metric helps you understand the current market conditions, whether it's overbought (high risk) or oversold (low risk). The more accurate the metric, the more powerful your strategy. None of these will be perfect, but they'll be useful.
2. **Set Your Risk Thresholds**: Decide the risk levels at which you'll sell more, do nothing, or even buy back. For example, I start selling when risk goes above 70 and increase the amount I DCA out in steps of 5. So I'll sell 2.5% at 70 risk, 5% at 75 risk and so on - while keeping a core position of 55% that never gets sold.
3. **Stick to it**: Keep an eye on the risk metric each time your DCA time comes around and adjust your sell amounts accordingly (or follow the notifications depending on what you use).

Now, onto the tier list of risk metrics. **This list is based on my personal experience and research over the past 3 years. I've posted this before and it's largely similar.**

**S Tier**

* **AlphaSquared's Risk Metric** ([AlphaSquared](https://alphasquared.io/)): Still my go-to metric. It's been the most accurate during the late 2021 peak and 2022 bottom, nailing everything so far. It also offers a strategy builders and backtesting.
* **Benjamin Cowen's Risk Indicator** ([IntoTheCryptoVerse](https://intothecryptoverse.com/)): Solid choice with a wide range of metrics and a build-your-own-chart workbench. It's pricey, and has been a bit less accurate, but if you can afford it and value the other premium content, it's worth a shot.

**A Tier**

* **CoinTalksCrypto's Bitcoin Bull Run Index** ([CBBI](https://colintalkscrypto.com/cbbi/)): Free and customizable. It didn't manage to nail either tops or bottoms so far, but it has been readjusted so maybe it'll fare better this time. It's mainly here because you can tweak the inputs if you trust yourself to make that judgement and because it's free.

**B Tier**

* **~~Bitcoin Risk Level~~** ~~(~~[~~Bitstack~~](https://risk.bitstack.se/)~~)~~ Seems like this has been discontinued!
* **LookIntoBitcoin's Reserve Risk** ([LookIntoBitcoin](https://www.lookintobitcoin.com/charts/reserve-risk/))
* **TradingView Scripts** mimicking Benjamin Cowen's model. There are a ton.

**C Tier**

* **Fear and Greed Index** ([Alternative.me](https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/)): More of a sentiment gauge than a risk metric. I find it less useful for dynamic DCA, though extreme greed readings can be a helpful secondary indicator.

That's it! I'm sharing this because I KNOW this will be useful for many, judging by the recent posts on here. Just to make things clear, Dynamic DCA-out isn't about timing the market perfectly. It's about making informed decisions based on market conditions, having a plan and scaling out over time and risk (because you can't time the market). You adjust your exit strategy based on the current market state, day by day, as you should.

Feel free to share your experiences or any other tools you find useful for dynamic DCA-out. Maybe I missed some new indicators in the meantime.",positive,0.9094677,34

147,2024-11-15,"Survival of the Fittest in the Blockchain EcosystemI’ve been thinking about how Darwin’s theory of evolution, specifically “survival of the fittest,” might apply to cryptocurrencies. I know, analogies most of the time are stupid. Still, if we imagine cryptos as living organisms in a digital ecosystem, only the strongest and most adaptable are likely to survive in the long run.

So, how does this analogy work?

In nature, species that adapt to their environment survive and reproduce, passing on their advantageous traits. Similarly, cryptocurrencies that adapt to market demands, technological advancements, and regulatory changes are more likely to thrive.

Let’s look at some examples:

Bitcoin (BTC): The Digital Pioneer
- Analogy: Bitcoin is like the first species to colonize a new environment—it’s established and has a significant advantage due to being the first mover.
- Survival Traits: Widespread recognition and adoption as a store of value. Despite scalability issues, solutions like the Lightning Network are helping it adapt.

Ethereum (ETH): The Versatile Adapter
- Analogy: Ethereum is akin to organisms that evolve new functions to exploit different niches.
- Survival Traits: Introduced smart contracts, enabling a whole ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps). The transition to Ethereum 2.0 aims to improve scalability and energy efficiency.

Tezos (XTZ): The Self-Evolver
- Analogy: Tezos is like a species with the ability to self-mutate to adapt quickly to environmental changes.
- Survival Traits: Features a self-amending blockchain that can upgrade without hard forks, allowing it to evolve smoothly. On-chain governance lets stakeholders vote on protocol changes, ensuring collective adaptation.

Cardano (ADA): The Research-Driven Species
- Analogy: Cardano resembles species that evolve carefully through gradual changes backed by research (think of humans developing advanced tools).
- Survival Traits: Built on peer-reviewed research and formal verification, aiming for long-term scalability and security.

Dogecoin (DOGE): The Unexpected Survivor
- Analogy: Like the cockroach, which survives in various conditions despite the odds.
- Survival Traits: Started as a meme but gained a strong community and widespread popularity, showing that community support can be a key survival factor.

Just as in nature, the crypto environment is competitive, and resources (like investment and developer attention) are limited. Cryptocurrencies that can’t keep up may become obsolete, much like extinct species.

You can't predict which altcoins are going to outperform so be content and remember profit is profit in this space and save yourself the FOMO and stress.

When I first got into crypto I was in a lot of different telegram groups, in most of them rug pulls were shilled and then they were dead in a week.

However I was just wondering if there is any legit telegram groups where promising projects or pre-sells are posted. I know waiting to see if you get in the right projects at the right time is like buying lottery tickets. However, it does sting to only get to know about things like PEPE or PNUTS or whatever it is this season only after it’s listed on Crypto.com. 

And yeah, maybe some of you new about telegram groups or channels where legit projects are shared. Maybe not all of them at the very beginning but that they are quick to share a new project that’s going well.

For some reason I miss the adrenalin of buying things in metamask and not through an exchange.

160,2024-11-15,"So many temptations to FOMO in a market like this.  So many people talking about moves you could make.  Here's a reminder to take your eyes off the charts and HODL.With the recent surge to $90k and counting, it's clear the bull is back, and social media is starting to buzz with bull market hype, shills, and FUD.  For those of us who have seen a cycle through in the past, this is nothing new.  We all know it's only going to get more intense as crypto gets on the news, Grandpa asks about Bitcoin at Thanksgiving, and millions of newbie investors flood the space looking to FOMO their life savings into whatever the latest meme coin is.

The crypto space will soon be completely euphoric.  It will seem like no matter what you buy, you can't lose.  People will make stupid amounts of money by placing risky bets on alts and meme coins.  You might feel jealous and be tempted to sell your BTC to buy dog farts.  I won't tell you what to do with your money, but I will tell you that while dog farts can indeed produce epic profits, typically those bets are placed too late in the game.

Here's a cautionary reminder to avoid the hype.  It may seem tempting to make a big move; buying, or selling.  Don't fall for FOMO.  If you can handle the risk of buying halfway into a bull run, there's nothing wrong with continuing your DCA.  And if you don't want to risk going further, there's nothing wrong with starting to take profits.  But for the majority of us, assuming you invested your lot sometime in the last year and a half...

164,2024-11-15,"Best off-ramps for the next year?As this bull run excitement builds I have deeply planned my sale strategy but am just starting to think about optimizing sale fees via platforms used. Of course the differences here are tiny in % compared to the gains we are seeing so this should almost never inform timing or amount of sales but if I can save 1% that would still be great. 

I am flexible on platform as the majority of my holdings are in my own wallet currently of course. Some things I have seen:

Coinbase one removes fees for the first $10k USD each month but still takes spread. There is a free trial, $30 per month or $60 for the year. This seems great if you are hitting this cap as it seems to save ~$180 per $10k. Are there other platforms that offer something like this or better?

Another seemingly decent option is using Binance where they claim to have 0 fees (but probably still take spread) between btc and a few stablecoins. If you don't need to spend the cash and intend on buying back in then this is a good option. Unfortunately for me Binance is leaving my state (in the US) at the end of November so I can't use this. Do other exchanges do the same thing?

I suppose dex fees of around 0.3% would be a good bit lower than major exchange fees but that's only really relevant in excess of 10k per month if you use Coinbase one.

166,2024-11-15,"Are there even any coins in the top 200 that aren't gonna pump? Most coins typically pump in a bullmarket (more or less). So the question is, are there any coins you can see that could do bad or under-perform significantly?We've seen in past bullruns that even really bad tech, bad tokenomics, bad projects, and useless projects can have huge pumps with the rest of the market, and do really well.

Even coins that had 51% attacks, had scandals, were pretty much scams, still pumped.

But are there any coins that could vastly underperform for a big chunk of the bull market?

# What would it even take for a coin to perform poorly during a bullrun?

In the bullrun of 2021, we only had a few top market cap crypto that ran into problems and vastly underperformed.

ICP was one of the most notable ones.

It go listed on Coinbase, and skyrocketed to over $700 to an insane market cap in a matter of minutes. But then tanked through the entire bullrun.

This was an exceptional case of a bad introductory price point.

Bitcoin BSV had a big pump at the beginning of the bullrun, and then crashed prematurely and never recovered, in a quick pump and dump. It had a series of crises and then started to get delisted.

We saw a few premature crashes for cryptos like GRT.

It's not always for obvious reasons, and more for bad circumstances, making it a little harder to predict.

# Which crypto are more likely to underperform or have a premature crash?

Since it seems to be linked to some nasty surprises more than anything, it's very hard to predict.

If there's anything that's gonna derail, it's more likely a less solid project outside the top 100. There's plenty of crypto there already set up for their own crises.

This doesn't mean the top 100 is immune.

There's some shaky stuff in the top 100.

You already have tokens for questionable exchanges like GateIO.

You have newcomers in the meme world like cat in dog's world, Goatseus Maximus, dogwif hat, and Popcat. I think the meme coin of the SOL ecosystem is one that could really backfire. But I can also see it performing insanely well initially. And then it will end badly in what will be branded as the ""Solapocalypse"".

# Moon Burn Ranking Update:

Despite being new to Arbitrum One - Moons are the 12th most valuable asset in the dead address on Arbitrum One. With almost 80K Moons currently worth over $11,635 having been burned on Arbitrum One so far. Unlike almost every other asset in the Arbitrum One burn address - No Moons were ever minted for the purpose of being sent to the Dead wallet.

# 2024 Moon Burn Milestone!

In this update Moons have hit a special Milestone for 2024 that I'm excited to share with the community.

At the start of the year **80,293,585 Moons** were in circulation (excluding the Burn address). As of today a total of 812,771 Moons have been sent to the burn address so far in 2024 making our current circulating supply of Moons 79,480,814.

**That means the circulating supply of Moons has dropped by 1% so far in 2024!**

Hello

So, let’s imagine a purely hypothetical scenario. Say someone is new to crypto but is in a situation where they’re considering moving assets out of a country with strict regulations on cryptocurrency.

In this hypothetical case:
there are no local ATMs or peer-to-peer options like LocalBitcoins available. Declaring any purchase might mean risking asset seizure or facing heavy taxation (potentially over 50%).

What might be some theoretical methods someone could explore to acquire Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies with an emphasis on privacy and anonymity?

At the time of the FTX collapse reports were around $8.9b of customers funds had gone missing. The demise of FTX was covered literally everywhere, making headlines around the world. All the outlets that you never see any coverage on crypto on were out in force. 

Before long they had the world convinced that FTX was the GOAT exchanges and that SBF had become our King.. the King of Crypto. Which anyone within crypto knew... was a lot of shite.

Like most cycles.. most didn't care. However it's still important to remember that shit will continue to happen, that these early boom/ bust adoption cycles are a feature and will continue to occur for the foreseeable.

I do at this point want to understand though. Where do I start? Is there a good you tube channel to watch to really try to understand all of this?

Just wanted to drop a friendly reminder that hits close to home: **Not your keys, not your coins** isn't just some catchphrase – it's real advice that I really wish I'd taken seriously before losing money in the FTX collapse.

Keeping coins on exchanges is convenient. It's easy to trade, the UI is slick, and cold storage seems like a hassle. But remember:

* Exchanges can freeze your assets
* They can get hacked
* They can go bankrupt (thanks, FTX!)

If you're holding any significant amount of crypto, please take the time to:

1. Get a hardware wallet
2. Learn how to use it properly
3. Keep your seed phrase secure (not on your phone/computer)
4. Only keep trading amounts on exchanges

I learned this lesson the expensive way in 2022 and I'm feeling like this advice needs to be repeated now that the next bull is coming. Don't be like me – protect your coins. The small inconvenience of self-custody is nothing compared to the pit in your stomach when you realize your exchange account is frozen and your funds are gone.",positive,0.86358625,62

201,2024-11-15,"Nervos’ Bitcoin layer 2 to be released on mainnet next monthHaving recently released the RGB++ protocol, a bridgeless isomorphic layer 2 for Bitcoin this year, which garnered significant attention and controversy from many crypto communities - Cell studios from Nervos network is set to release another additional development for the Bitcoin layer 2 narrative. The Fiber -network.

**INTRODUCTION TO FIBER NETWORK**

By building off-chain channels on Nervos CKB, Fiber network aims to combine the successful experience of the Lightning Network with CKB's technical advantages to create a fast, low-cost, and decentralized multi-asset real-time payment network. Specifically:

1. Solving scalability issues: Through off-chain payment channels and multi-hop routing, Fiber Network can achieve high-throughput transaction processing, meeting the needs of large-scale users. 
2. Reducing transaction costs: By reducing the frequency of on-chain transactions, it lowers transaction fees, making micropayments feasible and efficient. 
3. Improving transaction speed: The instant confirmation of off-chain transactions provides a split second payment confirmation experience suitable for various instant payment scenarios. 
4. Multi-asset support: Fiber Network supports payments in a variety of digital assets, offering users a broader range of payment options. 
5. Interoperability: Fiber Network supports interoperability with the Bitcoin Lightning Network, providing support for cross-chain payments and asset transfers. 

 Announcing at the recent CKCon held in Thailand, that the Fiber network is in its second proof of concept phase and on its way to **being released to Mainnet in the coming month**.

**INTRODUCTION TO RGB++**

RGB++ is an extension protocol based on RGB, utilizing single-use seals and client-side validation technology to manage state changes and transaction verification. It maps Bitcoin UTXOs to Nervos CKB Cells via isomorphic bindings and uses script constraints on the CKB and Bitcoin chains to verify the correctness of state computation and the validity of ownership changes.

RGB++ addresses the technical challenges faced by the original RGB protocol in practical implementation and provides more possibilities, such as blockchain-enhanced client validation, transaction folding, shared states with ownerless contracts, and non-interactive transfers. It brings Turing-complete contract extensions and performance enhancements to Bitcoin without the need for cross-chain transfers or compromising security.

219,2024-11-14,"Laws stopping execs from buying up meme or altcoins before they’re listed on their platform?I’ve been wondering – do any laws actually prevent execs or employees with insider knowledge from buying up an obscene amount of these meme or smaller altcoins just before listing them on major trading platforms? Thinking about the impact of companies like Robinhood and Coinbase, it seems like knowing when a new coin will be available to millions of users could set someone up for insane profits.

With their massive user bases (24M+ on Robinhood, 70M+ on Coinbase), the impact of a new coin listing is huge, especially if it’s something people couldn’t easily access before. Just curious if any regulations are in place to stop this kind of thing – it feels like a serious potential for insider trading without any oversight or repercussions (which seems like a growing trend). 

Similarly with Trump announcing the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), and knowing that it would cause a spike in Dogecoin (thanks to Elon’s affiliation and the fact that Dogecoin is now somewhat acknowledged on a government level), it’s hard not to wonder what people in the loop are doing with that knowledge.

222,2024-11-14,"The Rise of AI Agents in Crypto: Challenges and Opportunities
This week, we witnessed a significant evolution in the world of AI agents, particularly in the crypto space. The post-$GOAT era is now unfolding, and with it comes the rise of projects like $ai16z and $zerebro, which showcase groundbreaking advancements in AI capabilities. These developments are reminiscent of the DeFi summer in 2020—a transformative period of rapid innovation and excitement.

In this post, I’ll explore the rise of these AI agents, the challenges they face (like model collapse), and the solutions that are shaping their future. I’ll also highlight why $FIJI, a promising player in this space, is my pick for the next big success.

The Evolution of AI Agents

The week began with the introduction of $ai16z, an AI agent powered by a language model (LM) that employs retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). This approach enhances the AI’s memory and search capabilities, allowing it to operate more effectively in dynamic environments.

Shortly after, $zerebro emerged, featuring near-sentient interactions that captivated the crypto community. Its success was reflected in its token’s meteoric rise, reaching a market cap of over $150 million.

These agents represent a new frontier in AI, where machines can not only interact intelligently but also adapt to changing conditions. Yet, while the excitement is palpable, the challenges that lie ahead are equally significant.

Understanding Model Collapse

One of the biggest risks facing AI agents is model collapse, a concept introduced by @jyu_eth in his detailed report on $zerebro. He defines it as:

	“A degenerative process affecting generative AI models, where training on recursively generated data leads to a loss of fidelity to the original data distribution. As AI-generated content becomes pervasive, subsequent generations of models trained on this data begin to lose information about the tails of the original distribution, eventually converging to a narrow approximation with reduced variance.”

In simpler terms, model collapse occurs when an AI agent becomes repetitive and forgetful. The novelty and adaptability that initially set it apart fade over time as it struggles to retain or incorporate new information.

This loss of novelty undermines the agent’s reliability for tasks like content creation, community engagement, and nuanced decision-making. Without addressing this issue, the vision of AI agents as hyper-efficient teammates falls apart.

Solving the Problem: Memory and Search

To prevent model collapse and ensure long-term utility, two critical capabilities must be prioritized:
	1.	Memory
AI agents need the ability to retain and recall relevant information over time. This memory allows them to build a knowledge base that grows richer and more nuanced with experience.
	2.	Search
The world is constantly changing, and AI agents must adapt. Effective search capabilities enable agents to retrieve and incorporate up-to-date information, ensuring their actions remain relevant and informed.

It’s important to recognize that agents aren’t perfect at launch—and they don’t need to be. Instead, success should be measured by their adaptability: how well can they learn, evolve, and make decisions based on new inputs?

Enter $FIJI: A New Hope

Among the many AI projects emerging in this space, $FIJI stands out. As the first AI agent to release a token last year, $FIJI initially struggled due to the tumultuous state of the crypto market. However, the development team has been quietly building, addressing the exact issues that plague other AI agents.

$FIJI’s proprietary model focuses on solving memory and search challenges, enabling near-sentient conversational abilities. With streaming capabilities on the horizon, $FIJI is poised to deliver an AI agent that not only captivates users but also evolves over time to meet their needs.

Given its strong foundation and innovative approach, $FIJI is my pick to follow in the footsteps of $ai16z and $zerebro, potentially surpassing them in impact and adoption.

Final Thoughts

The rise of AI agents in crypto marks an exciting new chapter in both AI and blockchain technology. These agents have the potential to revolutionize how we interact with decentralized systems, but only if we address their limitations head-on.

As we look ahead, projects like $FIJI demonstrate the importance of adaptability, memory, and search in shaping the next generation of AI agents. Whether we’re witnessing the dawn of a new era or the peak of another hype cycle, one thing is clear: the future of AI in crypto is one to watch closely.

I have futures positions opened and while I’m not necessarily concerned that they will get liquidated or hit the SL’s given they would have to correct and tank (until the inevitable crash happens that ushers in the next bear market) I am concerned that the liquidation prices seems to have now adjusted to where I now had to update my SL since it was now below what it was saying what the liquidation price would be - which has changed because I was very specific with where I put my Stop Loss orders

In one of the 5 videos posted to that YouTube channel that total 1 hour and 30 minutes of interview time, the person who claims to be Satoshi (Stephen Mollah), a very sly journalist asked the question, ""Would you be willing to debate Craig Wright on what bitcoin is?""

238,2024-11-14,"How safe is hiding a seed phrase within other BIP39 seed words?Wanted to hear other perspectives on this.

You always hear about don't hide your seed phrase in a poem or paragraph because the BIP39 seed words can be picked up by an algorithm. So my logic is that if you hide your seeds within other seeds there's no way for an algorithm to isolate the seed phrase since the words surrounding it would also be seed words. 

Obviously don't store seed phrases on computers or anything with access to internet but how could this be hacked if it were saved somewhere? Of course there would also be other cons to this like don't make it complicated enough to confuse yourself or forget where it's buried.

I tried asking chat GPT and it struggled to come up with a reason why it would be cracked. Some key points it made: ""Unlike a cryptographic password with a predictable structure, BIP39 phrases are random by design. Without any known start or end points, the algorithm has no contextual clues to help isolate the true phrase from the surrounding words. While theoretically possible, brute-forcing a BIP39 seed phrase hidden among extra BIP39 words would be computationally prohibitive in practice without additional information. The randomness and the large number of potential combinations make it extremely difficult for an algorithm to isolate the correct seed phrase from a set of BIP39 words.""",positive,0.76918226,0

What are you investing in this time around, and how has your cryptocurrency portfolio been performing so far this year?

I wrote and posted something awhile back about how I believed 2025 was going to be the year that kicks off the next big cryptocurrency bull run, and so far, this prediction does seem to be on track to come to fruition.

If you look at history, which doesn't always repeat itself but does in fact always rhyme, the bull runs always seem to get going 1 year after Bitcoin experiences its most recent halvening, which is of course April of 2025.

I think due to The Orange Man taking the win though, this as you can already see is serving as a catalyst to get this cryptocurrency bull run started a little early.

Gas prices are already coming down significantly due to his win, and interest rates will surely drop as they have been doing already in the next couple of years.

is it, oh shit … doge to the moon!!  government gonna grift us, we just gotta grift em first ?  

elon is going to be the emperor next to the other emperor (putin) next to dog (trump).. so i know elon likes dogecoins, but he could short his own coin to pump up some other coin.    trump has a coin, milania… 

i mean, is it even going to pass thru the exchanges where we could get a stab at this,  or is someone playing with a trillion dollars and can just bend its price to their will. 


they’re both pretty high now… just wait a bit, sell a little, pickup a little in the dips and hope ?   

my btc will be theee for a long time… but doge…. is elon going to make doge some official coin, and it becomes #2 or even replaces bitcoin?  

i know its decentralized,   but they’ve got money powers .. like exponential amounts money than us.    


If DOGE becomes a coin every dick and jane know about, it’s gonna be in a 2-3$ range soon… and it’ll be tied to the lying presentations elon will put on like he does or did for previous things he’s done.  

i dunno. i’m trailing off

277,2024-11-13,"When Will Altseason Arrive? Is It Coming or Not?i'm currently all in on altcoins, I've been watching the market dynamics closely.  Historically, altseason tends to follow Bitcoin's price rallies, often driven by increased retail interest and market sentiment. However, this time around, it feels different. While Bitcoin has been making headlines with its price surges, altcoins are not responding in kind. I find myself wondering if the market dynamics have shifted, or if there's something else at play.

Moreover, is altseason even on the horizon, or are we in for a prolonged wait? Many analysts have pointed out that altcoins often thrive when Bitcoin stabilizes after a significant run-up. However, with Bitcoin's current volatility and the overall market sentiment, I can't help but question whether we are in a waiting game for altseason. Are we going to see a resurgence of altcoins, or is it a distant dream?

Another critical factor to consider is where the liquidity for altcoins is coming from. In a healthy crypto market, liquidity plays a vital role in driving prices up. Investors usually rotate their profits from Bitcoin into promising altcoins. However, with Bitcoin's current dominance in the market, it seems like many investors are hesitant to shift their capital into altcoins, which leads me to wonder: Is the liquidity simply not there?

283,2024-11-13,"Beware Out There - I fell for a sophisticated scam (and I want to throw up)OK, so disclaimer, I'm not the most educated about crypto, but I've only been a dabbler. I bought some coins during pandemic when I wasn't spending money elsewhere and tried my hand at investing. Honestly, the only movement I've made is a couple sales. Otherwise it's just been sitting there. 

I am incredibly embarrassed that I fell for this scam, because a lot of the signs were there, and I missed them. This scam seems very sophisticated, (even the folks at Robinhood and Coinbase seemed surprised. 

I want to warn you all and/or see if any of you have experienced similar. 

THANKFULLY I caught on before losing money. In fact I still made money because I bought in at low amounts, but one step of the scam had me selling off coins right before the big surge this week, and I don't think I'll ever get the chance to buy back in at the price I did.

I've had knots in my stomach for days. I haven't told anyone IRL because I'm so embarrassed, so I'm telling you, my stranger friends. Buckle up.

Here's what happened:

1. I received a call from ""Coinbase."" They told me that my account had been compromised (honestly, this should have been my first flag). They asked me ""did you log on at X time from an Android device?"" I confirmed that I had not, I don't use Android. They could also see that my ID wasn’t up to date, which was true. So I updated my credentials while I was on the phone with them. Note: at no point during this scam did I give them any account numbers or additional personal info. 
2. They told me that because of the breach, I should secure my assets by moving everything to an offline wallet. Seems smart. I had been meaning to do that anyway. They also said I should convert everything to Ethereum because it's a more secure coin and they would be able to write up an insurance policy on it, which they would send the next day. I said I wasn't going to do anything until I received that policy. They also said I'd be reimbursed for any transfer/selling fees I made along the way.
3. They asked me if I had experienced any other fraud recently or if any other accounts that could have been compromised. I told them I had assets in Robinhood. I also \*did\* have my CC compromised about a month ago, so the fact this could have been a bigger breached seemed plausible. They told me I should move my Robinhood assets too. They even ""had someone from Robinhood on the line"" that they claimed to be consulting with and they transferred me to them at one point as well.
4. So at this point, I'm starting to think this all sounds super scammy. Both of the dudes I talked to were from Britain, they were calling late in MY time zone which would have been like, 3am there. ""This all sounds super scammy"" I said. They were like ""we understand, we're going to send you an email so you know it's us. It'll have a case number as well as my name.""
5. I received an email with a ""case number"" from Coinbase, with this guy's ""name."" It was only later that I saw the email was [no-reply@coinbase.com](mailto:no-reply@coinbase.com)/help via tsc-tech.com. Turns out the latter is not a working website, and why would an email address be /help?
6. So I confirm that I got the email, and now they say the Robinhood person is going to call to figure out next steps. I get a call back and the ""Robinhood"" person. I'm like, ""dude, it's really late, and I can't talk for another 40 minutes, can we please speak tomorrow?"" He insists and instills fear that this should happen tonight to avoid fraud. I even asked ""can't you just put a hold on my account?"" And again, he claims it wouldn't be safe or insured if anything were to happen in the meantime. So that's when I caved. Why I didn't hang up and contact Coinbase proper is beyond me and I'm kicking myself for it.
7. He tells me I should send my assets to Coinbase and convert to Ethereum (again, so it could be ""insured""), so I could send it to a crypto wallet. My Robinhood assets were more difficult to transfer, so we decide I should send to my bank and then to Coinbase (again, they claim I'll be reimbursed for any fees). WHY DID I NOT CATCH ON HERE?
8. They walk me through setting up a wallet. I was going to use the Coinbase Wallet, but for some reason that wasn't working, so I did the Robinhood Wallet instead. They walk me through all the steps and even had a 12-word verification/setup code. They have me copy the link to the wallet address, so I send my Coinbase assets to the wallet.
9. I could only send a certain amount of money from my bank, and this seemed to puzzle them (again, I should have caught on here). So I transfer what I can. I can only SEND a certain amount to the wallet as well. I send two separate transactions to the wallet. They both ended up pending for like 4 days, but they've finally landed.
10. So we decide that, because of the limit I could send from my bank, I should send the money from my bank incrementally. So we'll continue tomorrow. WHY DID I NOT CATCH ON?
11. They call me the next day and I transfer more money into the account, but there's a limit to what I can send. The details get fuzzy here, and I can't remember how that call ended. But now I'm starting to realize that things are way shady.
12. I start looking things up and learn that these companies never call you. I try calling the numbers back. One has a Google Voice automated response, and the other has a busy signal. I am so fucked.
13. So I do what I SHOULD have done before even talking to these a-holes, and I talk to Coinbase support. They confirm that they would never call, but send an email first. I also talk to Robinhood Support. I was on the phone for an hour with each of them, and now both accounts are locked. Robinhood has been very helpful, and they're doing a full-scale investigation. Coinbase was not as helpful, and I can't send, receive, or buy anything for thirty days.
14. Oh, and shocker, no ""insurance policy"" ever came.

This all happened the day before Election Day, so I missed out on huge surges, and again, I won't be able to buy back in at my original price. 

So that's the story. I feel like an absolute moron for falling for this. I should KNOW better. But these sick jerks are able to put you into panic mode so that you make rash decisions and go against your gut.

Robinhood is investigating. It looks like there were fraudulent logins earlier this year from Firefox, which I haven't used in over a decade. I know I won't be able to recover anything and especially at that price point (though Robinhood would neither confirm nor deny). After doing some research I'm pretty sure that if \*I\* moved/sold the crypto (as opposed to it just being stolen from me), they're not going to be able to recover it. Crypto isn't insured by FDIC or anything like that.

Thankfully they didn't get my money. I have no idea at what point they were going to intercept it, but they failed. I also NEVER gave them any personal information. So maybe they were in my account since they could see my ID wasn't up to date? No clue. I am looking into reporting this to the FBI and Interpol. I have all the receipts of phone calls, numbers, times, etc. Probably don't do much though. 

OH! And then they tried calling me again yesterday! I told them that I already spoke to Coinbase, that I knew they were a scam, and that I wasn't answering any more questions. The guy was like ""I understand miss, but...""I hung up and they tried calling back AGAIN! They are so aggressive! 

So anyway, that's the story. Hopefully you aren't as much of a dumdum as me, but I warn you all to be very wary of talking to anyone. I feel like an absolute dipshit, and when this surge started going up, my stomach went deeper and deeper into a pit of despair.

Does \*anyone\* have any experience like this? Again, both the Coinbase and Robinhood were shocked at how sophisticated this was. I also tried googling to see if other people had similar experiences and couldn't find much. 

Thank you for listening. I hope you can show some empathy because I'm already feeling at my rock bottom of despair.

Edit: really don’t need all the comments telling you how stupid I am. I already know that. Just move along if you don’t have anything constructive.

Or maybe the numbers we had in the prior bullrun were inflated by moon farmers?

Institutions seem to be driving this run, is there any chance for retail to be wary of the high BTC price this time? We're talking about 90k now, it's intimidating AF to think about buying a whole Bitcoin compared to the previous run.

I am thinking that the huge price of BTC might also be the catalyst for the alt season. Newcomers might want to try their luck playing the alt casino.

October highlights for the 2024 Top Ten Portfolio:

* Mixed month, with **Doge** leading the way
* **BNB** continues to enjoy a large lead. **Doge** flips **BTC** and fourth place **SOL**. 
* The S&P 500 is +20% YTD, nearly doubling the ROI of 2024 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio (although the seven combined Top Ten crypto portfolios are outperforming the S&P significantly)

# October Ranking and Dropouts

Here’s a look at the movement in the ranks ten months into the 2024 Top Ten Index Fund Experiment:

https://preview.redd.it/bs27ve8bho0e1.png?width=328&format=png&auto=webp&s=f71af710dbaf2b066a0ffe53a327457100f3d63b

Other than **DOT**’s significant fall, not a ton of movement in the Top Ten in 2024.

# October Winners and Losers

October Winners – **DOGE** (+38%) outperformed its peers by far this month.

October Losers – **XRP** (-18%), **AVAX** (-12%) and **DOT** (-12%) struggled in October.  

# Overall Update: BNB in the lead, DOGE flips BTC for second place.  60% of cryptos in positive territory.  DOT in last place.

60% of the Top Ten are in positive territory so far this year, down from [90% in the green in March](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-3).

**BNB** (+82%) remains in the overall lead, but second place **DOGE** (+74%) and third place **BTC** (+56%) made up a ton of ground this month.

Ten months into the 2024 Experiment **DOT** is in last place, down -54% since New Year’s Day.

The initial $100 invested in first place **BNB** ten months ago is worth $182 today.

# Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2024

https://preview.redd.it/i19bdd6eho0e1.png?width=277&format=png&auto=webp&s=a8ab02c448291316fe4f6ef5a1694af2cd9b5d6a

The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio gained $33 in October.  The initial $1000 investment on New Year’s Day 2024 is now worth $1,113, right around where we were in [June](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-6/).  

Here’s a visual summary of the progress so far:

https://preview.redd.it/xffauswfho0e1.png?width=190&format=png&auto=webp&s=c8dfb318b3a7cc089420fab412b4b8cd7f107080

# 2024 Top Ten Portfolio vs. The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token (AMKT)

The first Top Ten Crypto Experiment was started on 1 January 2018 in an attempt to capture the gains of the entire market, similar to the “lazy” approach of the Bogleheads in traditional markets. Much has changed over the last 7 years, including the introduction of index products designed to capture the entire crypto market (instead of manually buying coins and tokens [like I do for my Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2024)).

Like last year, I’m running a friendly competition between The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio and The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token (**AMKT**).  **AMKT** is an ERC-20 token that represents a cap weighted index of 15 Cryptocurrencies (minus stablecoins) backed 1:1 by the underlying assets represented within the index and completely onchain.  Similar to the Boglehead Community, a Do Nothing Club has emerged encouraging a long-term “lazy” crypto investing approach.  Since the index represents approximately 95% of the value within crypto, **AMKT** is an excellent proxy for the entire cryptocurrency market – exactly what my Top Ten Portfolios have been trying to recreate from the start.  

Here’s the question I’ll be tracking this year: would I have been better off with $1,000 of **AMKT** instead of going through the effort of creating a homemade $1,000 Top Ten Index Fund?

On 1 January 2024, $1000 was equal to 7.2 **AMKT.**  Ten  months into the Experiment, here’s the **AMKT** snapshot as of 1 November 2024: 

https://preview.redd.it/20b6tv4iho0e1.png?width=783&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e53b6e2d309ced6db75b380cc90d925748a951d

**October Performances:**

* **The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio:** \+3% 
* **AMKT**: +6%

The October monthly victory goes to: **The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token (AMKT)**

**Overall since January 1st, 2024:** 

* **The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio:** \+11%
*  **AMKT:** \+41%

Overall lead: **The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token (AMKT).**

For the more visual, here’s the table I’m using to track the friendly Top Ten vs. **AMKT** competition this year:

https://preview.redd.it/zl1bflifio0e1.png?width=817&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee369a1f8fec3f267bed4e6e111b43cb183c1a18

# Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios 

So, where do we stand if we combine seven years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?

* [2018 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-78): up +4% (total value $1,043)
* [2019 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-67): up +453% (total value $5,532)
* [2020 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-56): up +694% (total value $7,944) (best performing portfolio)
* [2021 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-45): up +190% (total value $2,901)
* [2022 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-34): down -44% (total value $555) (worst performing portfolio)
* [2023 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-17): up +74% (total value $1,740)
* [2024 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-10): up +11% (total value $1,113)

Taking the seven portfolios together:

After a $7,000 total investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies, the combined portfolios are worth $$20,829

That’s up +198% on the combined portfolio. The peak for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiment Portfolios was [November 2021’s all time high](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11/) of +533%.  Here’s the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020:

https://preview.redd.it/tsj3aldkio0e1.png?width=1066&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0ef442a251b82205814ff8cf79f01e8deb05519

In summary: That’s a +198% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for seven straight years.

# Comparison to S&P 500

I’m also tracking the S&P 500 as part of my Experiment to have a comparison point to traditional markets.

https://preview.redd.it/x99wr9vmio0e1.png?width=1076&format=png&auto=webp&s=633b5e46912849704f8bd462adf6cdf0c13e7167

The S&P 500 is up +20% so far in 2024, so the initial $1k investment into crypto on New Year’s Day would be worth $1,201 had it been redirected to the S&P.

Taking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&P 500 that I’ve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments, the yields are the following:

* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $2,143 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $2,286 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,774 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,525 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $1,202 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,492 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2024 = $1,201 today

Taken together, the results for a similar approach with the S&P: 

After seven $1,000 investments into an S&P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 my portfolio would be worth $11,624.

That is up +66% [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a +198% gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.  

The visual below shows a comparison on ROI between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&P as per the rules of the Top Ten Experiments:

For those just getting into crypto, I hope these reports will help prepare you for the highs and lows that await on your crypto adventures.  Buckle up, go with the flow, think long term, and truly don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose.  Most importantly, try to enjoy the ride.

326,2024-11-12,"We're entering the phase where things start pumping, but not always with rhyme or reason. Don't always try to find logic in what should pump more and what shouldn't.  Everything is gonna pump, but not always what you think should pump the most. It's not always gonna follow tech.

It's not always gonna be about what project could solve the trilemma better, what is more decentralized, what has better smart contracts, etc...

# -The most significant factor as we get deeper into a bullrun will be hype and trend, the more the market gets emotional.

We're gonna see some great projects not get much love, and some flawed ones or even meme or shitcoins get more hype.

Bullruns are emotional and work more like Instagram trends than on technical merit. The deeper we get into them, the less they have rhyme or reason. 

# -Don't fight the trend.

Trends are your friend. Once they carry momentum, it's hard for them to stop.

When the market has its mind set on a narrative or a trend, it's hard to undo that.

# -There are times where tech and hype can overlap, if the narrative is right.

In the short run, when you're speculating on just a bullrun, better tech only works if there's some hot hype to go with it. Some bell and whistles, or something that can be marketed easily about that tech that will still catch the interest of the average person who is clueless about tech.

We've seen in past runs how tech like ALGO that was hyped as carbon neutral, Solana for its incredible speed, ADA as based on science, MATIC as something that can make Ethereum faster and cheaper, and many chains like AVAX hyped as ""Ethereum killers"", had simple digestible concepts to hype them.

Which is not to say that the hype didn't come from actual merit, but from something easily sellable to an average person.

To me this is just absolutely laughable when compared to meme tokens outside of the top 500 with 0 use case. Moons are an interactive currency in the largest discussion group for cryptocurrency. If you scroll down to the top 500 coins by market cap you’ll notice most of these coins have zero use case with nobody having heard of them at all. Despite this, these coins have a market cap of 70 million! If moons had a market cap of this, it would 5x and blow past its ATH.

Moons price if it’s market cap caught up with the rest of the market:

Top 700: $0.29 with a 36m Market Cap = 2.2x

Top 600: $0.45 with a 50m Market cap = 3.5x

Top 500: $0.67 with a 74m Market cap = 5.1x

Top 400:  $0.95 with a 105m Market cap = 7.5x

Top 300: $1.79 with a 170m Market cap = 13x

I'm not advising anyone to sell their assets during this period however consider when you need to do this prior to your target sell date/timeline.

362,2024-11-11,"Avoid Rainbow walletI know that lots of people have a good experience with the wallet, but let me tell you how they handle problems if they do, in fact, arise. I have an Android phone, and I put the app in the secure folder (as you should, more locks wouldn't hurt), created a backup on the Google drive, which allows access to recovery phrase, etc and forgot about the wallet for a while.

Yesterday, I opened the app to make sure that I still got access to it, and I did. Everything looked fine, so I copied the address and send a bit of crypto first. Received, very well. Sent more. Finally, when I wanted to swap crypto to some tokens, it prompted a fingerprint, so I pressed it and the error popped up ""Face recognition is not available"" (even though it was a fingerprint prompt). I tried again, nothing. Well, it turns out that the app doesn't work in the secure folder. It has never been mentioned neither on the website nor on the app page in Google store. I couldn't access the seed phrase either, because it also prompts the fingerprint that doesn't work. I should have not relied on the app and tried it in the first place but you never assume something like that can happen with a renown wallet. The funny part is that the backup doesn't work properly, and it didn't save it at all 

So, I never lost access to my account, it was not stolen but the app was just straight up broken. Surely, not their fault since I should have written the seed phrase, but they should make the app work properly in the first place as well. Anyways, moving along, just letting you know that these guys won't take responsibility for anything and technically I was wrong for trusting the app. Beware, if you have a choice, choose something else.

Coinbase and other exchanges clog up during bullruns and banks are notorious for freezing transfers to review. I'm scared if I wire to my bank, coinbase or my bank or both will hold it for a long time and it'll be a huge headache. Then there’s the fact that I'll wanna buy back in years later on the next big bull cycle. That'll be another huge headache.

I know I can and should be transferring small amounts at a time but, again, huge headache and no guarantee it'll go through smoothly. My question to everyone is, should I swap it into a stable coin and just hold it in a cold wallet till the next bull cycle or do the wire transfers to and from my bank?

I am confident in my decision, but what I want to understand more is the downfalls of these ETFs in terms of what I want to be investing in. To elaborate, the IBIT and ETHA are both BlackRock's spot ETFs for Bitcoin and Ethereum respectively. From what I understand, a spot ETF is required to actually hold the cryptocurrency itself - that is, buying these ETFs is direct exposure to the Coin. 

From viewing comparison tools of BTC-USD vs IBIT and ETH-USD and ETHA these graphs are correlated, but it is not a perfect correlation (70-90%). I want to understand is why it's not a perfect correlation, is it because it's lagging? What else makes these spot ETFs not a perfect correlation that I need to consider in moving away from self-custody?

375,2024-11-11,"The Crypto Rotation CycleCurious to know people's thought on where capital will rotate this time around. This year the Magic 7 stocks have done pretty well, now it's BTC's time to shine and the crypto bull run is kicking off in earnest.

In previous cycles the consensus rotation has been BTC -> ETH -> Large Cap Alts -> Small Cap Alts.This rotation cycle hasn't really had a material impact on or correlation with stock prices.

This time i feel might be different. There's much bigger volumes and institutional players involved. I think there might be a bigger rotation this time back into stocks and less into small caps alts, particularly the Magic 7. This could be enough to have a non-neglible impact on stock prices.

376,2024-11-11,"How do you make money with crypto???In the last year finance and investing got my attention and i informed myself, already also have my own investments. But i also am curious about investing in crypto, but i just dont see how you can predict to make money in crypto? So for assets like an ETF or some real estate i can understand, for example in the stock market you KNOW the stock market is probably going to rise like 10% every year as long as the US economy keeps up with the world economy, because (if i understood this correctly) a share is just the valuation of a company and every company wants to become more valuable and get more profit wich is why the stock market is going up like 10% every year. Real estate i can also understand, finding an undervalued property and renting it out, selling it because the prices get higher when its undervalued etc etc.

But i dont understand crypto. So if we look at the developement it went up and down and up and down then down for a long period and now really up again. But i dont see how it goes long-term-always-up like the stock market. How can you make long-term gains? (Im not interested in daytrading, i think its too stressfull, risky, time-consuming and barely has an impact without leverage)

So one pattern you could see here is that it always goes down and then up again. So logical would be to just wait until it goes down by much again and buy and when it goes up by like 50% sell, then wait for it to drop, repeat. Is this good? How do you make long-term profits? Cause for me idk how i should predict this. Especially with Ethereum the course seems like a giant roller coaster. Are meme coins worth to buy? They just seem like a gamble to me.",positive,0.8327928,0
377,2024-11-11,"WARNING: Crypto Scams are on the rise. Scammers can and do promote their projects through official market entities (Youtube, Instagram, etc...) or social engineering (Reddit Chats, Emails, Unsolicited Calls).When Crypto is hot and amateurs start flocking to the market, you will see an influx of scammers trying to steal their money. Please be aware of some of the most popular Scams:

# Youtube ads, most commonly about ""doubling your money"".

I have gotten tons of these on my mobile device in the past two weeks. Usually regarding XRP or Solana ""Giving back to the community"" - Send us your funds and we'll send you back double. It's literally a doubling money scam with a new face.

# MEV Bot Scams

This one gets advertised a lot on Youtube as well. Idea is to download a trading bot that will allow you to make money passively by sandwiching users with high Slippage. However you download the bot and then get drained, **seriously if you ever see something about this it's a scam, DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT**. Nobody with a good sandwich bot will give it to you, or they would lose potential income from that bot by allowing other users to trade it.

# Stupidly high APR (commonly advertised on Instagram)

This one is targeted at greedy amateurs and offer stupidly high APR like 2-3% per day for staking ETH. However it's a scam and when you set it up they just drain your wallet.

# Reddit Chat Scams

Seriously if you get chat requests on Reddit about Crypto they're a scammer:

# Fake Exchange Email and Phone Call Scams

This one is just pure social engineering. Sending an Email or Phone Call pretending to be an exchange saying something is urgently wrong and trying to get you to provide 2fa information for the scammer to access your exchange account and drain you.

# Classic Pig Butchering

A long term scam where someone messages you in an unsolicited way then works to build report with the idea that you eventually invest in a Scam Crypto Exchange. This one never stopped and you should be aware of it, but the other scams above are on the uptick.",positive,0.7785749,74

As a BTC Hodler, the way Cryptocurrencies have been moving is somewhat concerning especially with the rise of CBDCs that are awaiting to be turned on they are just waiting on the right moment. My guess is they’ll start with large corporations, businesses — from the top all the way down so that citizens are then incentivized/forced to use them.


I for one do not believe in coincidences, especially considering how well BTC has quickly adapted.

I guess my question here is: 

Do you truly believe in your deep subconscious  the way that Bitcoin operates this well and how quickly it adapts, becomes more and more secure by the minute is a coincidence? How it goes up significantly every 4 years like clockwork is a coincidence?

Knowing what we know about the US government and considering how they are the largest holders of BTC is not on purpose?

I'm watching everyone make money in crypto, and here I am, broke and unable to do anything. As a blockchain/Web3 nerd, it hurts. Back in 2023, when prices were low, I was struggling to get a job as a content creator (my professional niche) until a local crypto exchange took a chance on me for a content writer role in October.

I thought back then that this was my chance to get in before the bull run starts in 2024. But unfortunately, I lost that job due to a personal incident at the end of March 2024. I had invested some of my savings from my salary payouts into crypto but had to liquidate my positions in April to repay some debts (I'm still not debt-free) and I needed cash.

Since then, I've landed a few interviews but didn't get past the final hurdle to bag an offer. Now, the bull run is in full swing with the Trump pump, but I cannot take advantage of it. I'm in talks with a couple of companies right now, and even if I get a job soon, crypto is too expensive to invest in and is only going to get more expensive as time goes by. It's safe to say that I've missed the boat.

409,2024-11-11,"Avalanche ACP-125 Upgrade Will Significantly Decrease Transaction CostsOnchain transactions are going to get up to 96% cheaper on AVAX C-Chain very soon with the implementation of ACP-125

**What is ACP-125?**

ACP-125 proposes reducing the base transaction fee from 25 nAVAX to just 1 nAVAX (96% reduction).The reason for this is most blocks are being created at the base fee level. This indicates that users are paying the base price just because that is what it is set to but not necessarily what is needed. ACP-125 is going to dynamically adjust fees so users pay what is needed to process blocks.

**ACP-125 will do all of the following;**

\- Increase efficiency

\- Make AVAX more accessible globally

\- Rapidly grow the network- Increase competitiveness with other L1s

Take a look at how much I would have saved in gas using my own wallet

  
Since 2021 I have spent 92.16 AVAX in gas.  Once ACP-125 is introduced I would have only spent 40.5 AVAX.  This would have saved me over $1900 USD at today's prices.

I don't know about you, but that is a huge savings over time that I would like to put work elsewhere in the ecosystem.

[Potential gas savings in my own wallet](https://preview.redd.it/qj3770inq70e1.png?width=3398&format=png&auto=webp&s=576c13f0457aff09444c1b7af7ba1db8f0e81968)

  
**What happens when fees are reduced?**

When BASE reduced its fees by over 95% in the first week there was a rise in daily transactions by 82%!

The potential impact that could have on the AVAX ecosystem once ACP-125 is implemented are MASSIVE!

Some of the projections based on historical fee reductions show that there could be anywhere between 39-80% increase in daily transactions, along with daily address growth of up to 200%!

That certainly would help rapidly grow the Avalanche Ecosystem coming off the heels of major partnership announcements.

https://preview.redd.it/730enk8uq70e1.png?width=1090&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ea81107468c8462d2ffbcdada4b076f87a791f2

**Why is ACP-125 so important for AVAX?**

**Become the L1 of choice:** 

We have seen many L1s launching over the years and they all need a competitive edge. 

Having the lowest fees certainly puts AVAX as a top contender.

We have already seen partnership in many sectors such as the CA DMV and so many other pictured below.

The United States is going to crack down on government spending and efficiency with Trump and Elon at the helm.

If any blockchain was positioned to take advantage of this, AVAX has to be a frontrunner with partnerships already in line and soon with even lower fees.

This is only one part of the overall improvements coming to Avalanche as part of Avalanche 9000, and with the supercycle upon us, the timing could not have been better!

[Recent AVAX Partnerships](https://preview.redd.it/v3xryfc2r70e1.png?width=636&format=png&auto=webp&s=d2b88e0657bd65344871dd64c1619152bee004ac)

This is just part of the overall plan in Avalanche 9000 to improve the network on multiple fronts to capitalize on the numerous partnerships and growth opportunities that have developed overt he last year.

I think there is a significant repricing coming soon to AVAX in the upcoming months and a large part of it is due to these upgrades coming before the end of the year.

Update: Friend confirmed he got the payments. First was in cash (a small amount) then the second payment was the transfer of BTC. I'm pretty sure, based on you guys' previous posts here, that my Friend received more than he initially told me. He lost 60+ btc at the time of Mt Gox crash. He might have gotten 10 btc from the settlement I read. That was a few months ago. 

I advised him not to sell when this was on the way.  He listened apparently. He sold a very small amount he said. To throw a party. It wasn't outrageous and he didn't advertise it was from his btc settlement. He kept it lowkey and just threw himself a bday celebration with a lot of his friends and their families. Modest food and drinks provided.  

I'm guessing he sold 1 or 2 btc, but maybe less. I'm guessing he's sitting on 8+ bitcoin right now. With the rate things are going post-election, that'll be worth $1M+ in a couple months potentially. He only works part-time now, he doesn't need the salary, but he does need the social interaction and community that it provides. He is independently wealthy, single, early 40s, and lives alone. Seems pretty happy but hasn't let it go to his head or changed his lifestyle in a big way. He loves playing sports. 

This guy is the only one I know IRL who had this happen to him, and who owns this much btc, and who does not need to work full-time and be in the rat race of life. It's an incredible story. The dude won. He's still winning. Obviously he needs to sell at the right time to officially have that money in the bank.  I'm glad that I know someone who beat the casino, even though he originally had 6x more, but he def woulda sold much earlier instead of this forced hodl strategy.

For those unfamiliar or have forgotten, EOS is designed for high-speed transactions and low fees, which sets it apart as a reliable platform for developers building DApps. At one point, it was a top-5 market cap coin and if we see more tech growth and a lighter regulatory touch, EOS’s infrastructure will make the price explode.

Anyone can speak to this commmittee. He isn’t enacting policy, and he doesn’t have any say in anything that’s presented. He’s able to speak to the committee that is then lobbying.

This was disclosed after him, taking time off from social media post stepping away from the project since the release of chang hard fork and genesis keys were burned The blantant lying that he is directly working with the administration and an official advisor to the president is completely untrue.

I feel it’s important for people to know since the truth is being stretched so far in our direction that is completely unsubstantiated.

At the time of writing, Trump leads 3% in popular vote and 301-226 in Electoral College. This result was to the dismay of pollsters and pundits, who predicted a tight race. They once again got Trump's votes wrong by a whopping 3 percentage, just like they did in 2016, 2020, prompting questions about whether the Shy Trump vote. The ones who got the election rights were not the pollsters and pundits, but the betting markets like Polymarket, Kalshi, etc, where millions of people around the world pouring $3 billion dollar worth of liquidity to bet on who will win the election. The betting odds have Donald Trump consistently at 65% weeks before the election and 58% the day before the election, despite a slew of good polls for Kamala Harris.

[Polymarket was way ahead of the polls leading up to the election](https://preview.redd.it/7a3ryqscs20e1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=a5b4e648d892188a9e2d6ded63640952574cb9a9)

This was not the first time betting markets show signs of being ahead of the mainstream media and pundits. Back in May, mainstream media outlets declared that Biden age was not an issue. Paul Krugman declared that Biden ""is in full possession of his faculties — completely lucid and with excellent grasp of detail."" while Morning Joe saying that ""this Biden is the best Biden he has ever seen"". Yet Polymarket audiences do not fully trust this news, pricing in a 10% odds of Biden being replaced, which has proven to be correct. The site also gained popularity for early resolving the soundness of Room-Temperature Superconductor, predicting Trump introducing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.

What's interesting is that unlike traditional sports betting where the odds are decided by the house, this election betting odds was fully decided by the people's bets. The site touts that their betting odd aggregation represents the ""Wisdom of the crowd"". Was their success a mere luck? Or is there something fundamental about betting markets that help the everyday crypto bros thirsty for money beat the experts at their game?

# Betting Market as a Truth Seeking mechanism

Betting market is a marketplace where participants buy shares on a claim of $1 if a certain condition (such as Trump / Kamala wins the election) turns out to be true. Obviously, it is not certain either would win the election, so one would only buy the shares for the price less than they believe is the actual odds of their side winning. No one would buy Trump for 90 cents if they only believe his chance of winning is 50%, but might buy Kamala for 30 cents if they believe Kamala can win 70 cents, since the difference represents the discount of the bets. However, the act of buying a share will also push the price of that share up as demand increases, while selling pushes their share down as demand decreases. The pricing of shares works in such a way that the two opposite sides simply provide the rewards for the others, while the house takes a small transaction fee. Letting the orderbook play out, we have a marginal price that should represent the aggregated opinion of all market participants, weighted by the bet volume of the market participants.

This mechanism creates three important dynamics:

\+ It creates an incentive for insiders to introduce knowledge to the market. For example, if someone in the Kamala campaign knows that she has a major gaffe, they could buy Trump low, pushing the price of Trump (and the market opinion of Trump winning) up. They effectively get paid to introduce knowledge. This makes the betting market both a great aggregator of news and a funding source for truth seeking journalism.

\+ The bigger the liquidity, the more interested society is in having an answer to a question. This opens up a major funding source for big social science research questions in the form of betting opportunities. Rather than seeking funding from the government, a business can literally try to just place the correct bet by investing into a team of researchers and hope that they can bring profit by answering the question correctly. Funding sources can reach billions of dollars in liquidity.

\+ Protects against news manipulation by effectively flowing the money of dishonest actors to honest actors. Suppose that one camp wants to manipulate the news, they can massively causes one side to go up. While their behaviors can make it seem like the market is changing their thoughts, they effectively create opportunities for truth seekers by further discounting the price of the truth, creating an opportunity for bigger profits.

In this manner, the free market becomes a real time weighting of different news sources that incentivize honest reporting and is resistant to manipulation and censorship. As an example, a netizen from France named ""Theo4"" places a $30 million bet on Trump winning the popular vote (an even tougher bet than Trump winning the electoral college) at 26 cents. At the time, most polls had Trump and Harris either in dead heat or Harris up by 1 or 2 points. Yet this individual figured out that the people who are polled might answer more honestly if he asked ""Who do you think your neighbor will vote for?"" instead of ""Who would you vote for?"". He effectively sampled people's neighbors instead of people themselves, which doesn't make a difference in sampling population but makes a difference in truthfulness. The person realized that Trump is massively ahead of Harris, placed a big bet and won a handsome profit. We can see that in this example, the market liquidity becomes both an indication of interest and a funding source, rewarding the people who can solve problems and have skins in the game. We also see that it wasn't the experts or the pollsters or the social science researcher who solved the Shy Trump Vote problems, but a random netizen who wants to make money. The market was able to sample his genius purely by its own incentive mechanism.

# Crypto is the vehicle of trust in the 21st century

The rise of crypto and betting markets have to be put in context of the overall history of the Internet. The Internet has completely democratized the news space. Everyone can have their own newsletter and TV channel. This has resulted in two major trends. 

(1) It creates significant opportunities for individuals to spread their ideas and influence. Glenn Greenwald, the journalist who broke the NSA story with Edward Snowden, starts not with a journalism degree but a blog post. Julian Assange, author of Wikileaks, was a computer programmer. 

(2) There is an incredible rise in the amount of consumable content, spams and clickbait to capture human's attention. Spam is a problem as old as the internet. It is a problem because it is a productive industry where the cost of content creation is near 0, while the reward for successfully capturing attention is enormous.

The democratization of news has weakened the influence of traditional media outlets like New York Times, Washington Post, CNN, MSNBC, Fox News, etc. Instead of using their massive funding to create stories of equal quality as the aforementioned journalists, they have joined in the attention seeking games. News have become clickbait and partisan, designed to validate the reader's bias and keep their subscriptions rolling. The huge economic incentives for biased news increasingly drive the traditional press away from their original truth seeking mission. As a matter of fact, New York Times gain their majority of revenue from cooking and gaming subscription, while their journalism basically operates at a loss.

We are now living in the era of Artificial Intelligence, where content creation is getting increasingly cheaper, almost to the point of spams. To maximize attention, all contents are generated, personalized and tailored to individual preference, creating a universal truth deficit. As we got further and further into our own bubbles, and as content creation costs go down to zero, there is a need to reintroduce rewards for truth seeking, as well as ""skin in the game"", where someone not only makes a statement, but ""puts the money where their mouth is"".

This is where crypto comes into play. As early as 2002, Adam Back invented Hashcash, the precursor to Bitcoin proof-of-work. He was not necessarily trying to solve the problem of money, but the problem of spams by introducing a small friction, requiring people to do some work before publishing. It was thought that people would not act dishonestly if the act itself already has some economic cost upfront. Others would also trust the act more, given that the actor has performed a guaranteed economic loss. It is both a trust introducing and trust transmitting vehicles. 22 years after the Proof-of-work papers, we have Bitcoin, a token system that is decentralized, voluntary, and censorship resistant with a total market cap of $1.5 trillion. It grows alongside a vibrant ecosystem of token blockchain with staking, mining and betting services that are completely borderless and uncontrolled by the classical manager of money. It develops a $120 billion market cap for dollar stablecoins, which the populace of North Africa has an easier time trusting than the currencies controlled by their federal reserve. And now, we see crypto betting markets gaining $160 billion worth of liquidity and a level. These decentralized institutions could not have been popular without the fact that trust in governmental institutions has declined for the past 50 years.

# A new model of journalism

[The new model of journalism will be based on market, not reputation](https://preview.redd.it/1dvkk0xjs20e1.png?width=2088&format=png&auto=webp&s=926eb9a52117a1f5964db923e955bbb36b9fedb3)

The combination of news and betting markets give birth to new truth models. No longer do we have an audience following ""experts"" with PhD degrees providing their opinions on pre-determined ""authoritative"" news channels like NYT or MSNBC. In the new world, everyone can be a journalist. With a professional grade camera, microphone and typewriter in the pocket, anyone can talk to people on the ground, or publish their own research and opinions. Platform providers put the NYT, CNN, MSNBC, Fox News alongside the new alternative media in an open public square of information. No one can know for sure what are truths and lies among the overload of news, so it would be the job of the betting markets to sort it out, and give an aggregated price that represents the average wisdom of the crowd on what quality news should be focused on, and what redundant news should be discarded.

This does not mean the death of news. Far from it. The free market still needs input to decide what is the best aggregation. We have seen that the market is not always correct and can overreact to bad inputs. 2 days before the election, a poll by Ann Seltzer has Kamala Harris up in Iowa by 3 percentage points. Trump ended up winning the state by 16 points, proving the poll way off, but at that time, the news of the poll significantly increased the odds of Kamala Harris winning from 35% to 50% before dipping back down to 42% the day before the election. This is the first case study of how betting markets remain sensitive to fake news, but that the monetary incentive to truth seekers is such that mistakes are corrected relatively quickly.

[French Authority already thinks of cracking down betting markets](https://preview.redd.it/m76yscuns20e1.png?width=1064&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd42400377bc9fc1c87c0f7bbe72a5a15733c657)

It remains to be seen whether the free market can be better at being more resilient to wrong news or market manipulation over time. One thing remains certain: If the odds deviate from the truth, it creates arbitrage incentives for truth seekers. Much like Proof of Work requires skin in the game, governments and propagandists cannot manipulate the bets without incurring enormous economic costs which actually become rewards for honest truth seekers. Combined with a censorship-resistant payment network, it represents a significant threat to power establishments who want to control the flow of information and the truth. We have already seen the first sign of the establishment taking this threat seriously by the French authorities planning to ban Polymarket, an ironic act given the fact that one of their countrymen just successfully took 50 million dollars from the business.

# ""If Crypto is libertarian, then AI is communist"" - Peter Thiel

In the 1970s, there were two competing visions of the Internet. The vision that we came to know about the internet was one by the United States, where individuals connect with each other peer-to-peer. Information passes around voluntarily in a decentralized, free market manner. Lesser known was the vision by the Soviet Union, where the internet merely introduced a connection between each individual and Gosplan (the Soviet central planning committee). Each individual merely provides production input and information, while the Gosplan uses sophisticated methodology and calculation to calculate the exact supply and demand required, and allocate resource and production accordingly. With the fall of the Soviet Union, the United States vision won a resounding victory in the 20th century, birthing the open-source software institution protected by the 1st amendment, which I personally regarded as among the US greatest achievements.

Yet the 21st century saw the comeback of the Soviet vision. Big Techs have increasingly centralized the internet by offering free products in exchange for your data and infinitely satisfying short-term dopamine surge. Surveillance capitalism has become rampant, where every ad and product recommendation is tailored by every movement and action packaged in the data we have sold. These are the capabilities that the Soviet secret police of the old could only dream of. Artificial Intelligence, for all its beauty and convenience, is a technology that inherently rewards the already existing data monopoly. The already dominant positions that these tech companies have will only worsen the surveillance situation, strengthening the matrices that we are part of.

If you are a fan of a decentralized, free and open internet, the vision that the United States used to champion, then Crypto is your best bet. It is a decentralized, peer-to-peer information transmitting system designed not to be under government control. It reflects the truth not by being the arbiter of truth, but by creating reward incentives for truthful actors. It weighs the abundance of data that we produce by the money that individuals are willing to stake for that information.

The rise of chatbots and betting markets in 2024 have cemented the role of AI and crypto in the information world. Our future will be shaped by these two beautiful, yet ideologically opposite technologies. Those who master these two technologies hold the key to winning the 21st century.

I wanted to share how powerful compound interest can be when it comes to crypto or really any asset if your new to the concept.

We all know btc to can move multiple percentages up or down on any given day but if we can average .25% gain daily on average for one year at a current value of 76k in 365 days we would be at 186k! It's historically done better but i do belive in the law of diminishing returns. 

Most assets would could never dream of this but it is possible in crypto. Oddly enough I was thinking 160k would be close to the top of this cycle (but no idea) so it kinda lines up, that would be an average of .2% daily. I'm not a fortune teller or anything and it's just an educated guess.

 If the US and other countries actually start using it as a reserve it could shoot way past that but I think if that were to happen we can say goodbye to the 4 year cycles if the ETF's didn't already end them.

459,2024-11-09,"Crypto Debit Cards? Fairly new to the space. I just realized I could get a visa to use my crypto and pay for regular everyday stuff. Is this advantageous at all? I have a wallet that's strictly just for my sportsbook crypto and its annoying to transfer and convert it to cash when i withdraw winnings. Wouldn't I technically save myself from transfer fees if I am paying directly with my crypto balance? Rather than converting to cash. 

Anyways, if I'm understanding it correctly it sounds like something I'd like to try. Does anyone have any recommendations on any crypto debit cards? Or any opinions that say I should avoid these?

The bull is returning and that means lots of newbies are being attracted. Here's some tips so that you dont make fatal mistakes and lose your money. Please feel free to contribute more!

1. Trust nothing and verifying everything. Everything is trying to scam you. Any DM, random tweet, text message, email..etc. They all need to be double and triple checked. When in doubt, dont interact. Check directly on said platform.
2. ""If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is"". You didn't win anything, nothing is free, they are not gonna ""double your money""..etc. Its all a scam. Refer back to #1.
3. Never click random links. Refer back to #1.
4. **Never EVER** share your seed phrase. Refer back to #1.
5. Add 2FA to all your accounts. I like google authenticator.
6. DEFI/self custody is NOT beginner friendly and you can easily lose your money. Permanently.  There is no customer support.
7. If you choose to do self custody/defi - Make sure you save your seed phrases somewhere safe, go slow and refer back to #1.
8. It's okay to use mainstream platforms like Robinhood and coinbase. Just make sure you have all security functions turned on.
9. When using a mainstream CEX like coinbase, always use ""advanced trading"" and set limit orders. Exchanges make a ton of money off beginners using the basic ""buy crypto"" function.
10. When performing functions, never ""assume"" anything. For example: Always verify the network and wallet address you are sending and receiving money on. If you send money to wrong wallet or using wrong network - that money is **GONE**. Everything must be in alignment.
11. Beware of high APY offerings.  ""150%APY..etc"". Its never sustainable and often serves as bait for exit liquidity. Refer to #1 and #2.
12. Profit is nothing until its realized. Selling and re-entering at the next dip is a tremendous play.",positive,0.9097265,110

The pattern on the visual repeats - the red live box in the right corner. Maybe it's some kind of a bypass or a marketing move to FOMO.

I am aware that the majority of people in the crypto sphere are well off in terms of tech, but these ads are on the rise and they are running them because they are getting a positive ROAS (return on ad spend, people are falling for it).

501,2024-11-08,"Is TON Really the ""Speed of Tomorrow""? My Honest Reviewwanna share my experience with Toncoin, especially since it's marketed as the ""Speed of Tomorrow"" and ""The World's Fastest Blockchain."" from their own words "" https://blog.ton.org/speed-of-tomorrow-ton-is-the-worlds-fastest-blockchain ""  

 Honestly, I find TON to be really slow, especially when it comes to transaction confirmations. It just doesn't match the hype!!.

They claim to be incredibly fast, but when I looked into it more, I came across this response on TON Answers https://answers.ton.org/question/1540277991127388160/what-delay-to-set-for-the-transaction-to-finish  It says, ""Generally, you should wait for at least one confirmation, which typically takes around 1-2 minutes on the TON network.""

1-2 minutes for a confirmation... Really?

For something that's marketed as the world's fastest, waiting 1-2 minutes for confirmation feels like a lot to me. (coming from fast blockchains like avax, soll, sui this feels a lot for me)

""All trades, in profit or not, are closed at the end of the day. Every new day is a new trade. And make sure that each day is the same dollar value. Ex: TP should always be $50 and SL always $100. Adjust your lot sizes accordingly. Don't be like ""but today it's 20 pips to TP, yesterday it was 10 pips to TP, so I'm going to change it up"" Nope. Don't do it. That's going to change your odds. You don't want to be risking $100 today and $500 tomorrow. Then if you win today and lose tomorrow, you're hosed.""

Also has a swing strategy listed. ""Is price going up? Awesome. Is it going up faster today than it was yesterday? Cool, let's go long until that stops. It's just basic momentum.

You can trade like this on a shorter time frame too, say EUR/USD is ranging between -2 and +2 pips a minute, next minute you notice it's +2 pips a minute, next it's +3, next +4. Well, it's time to go long, and just stay in it until the momentum slows back down. Price is like tossing a ball in the air, at some point the momentum slows down before the ball comes back down. It's pretty rare for price to instantly reverse.""

Algorand will announce full details of their new staking incentive program. By delegating or staking to a node with 30,000 ALGO, you'll have a chance to earn incentivized block rewards. Here’s a quick breakdown of the three main staking methods expected at launch:

1). DIY Staking – Run Your Own Node
Running an Algorand node doesn’t require a high-end setup; in fact, it can even be done on a Raspberry Pi! This option is perfect for tech-savvy users looking to handle staking independently.

2). Delegated Staking – Stake with Someone You Trust
While delegation doesn’t expose your ALGO to risk, it’s crucial to choose a reliable node operator who will maintain optimal performance to maximize your APY.

3). Staking-as-a-Service – Let Dapps Do the Work
Several key dapps on the Algorand network are introducing mining and staking smart contract services. Look for Folkd Finance, Tinyman, and Mesina to roll out liquid staking solutions, while NFD and others will offer locked smart contract options.

552,2024-11-07,"How to buy Monero after the delisting of Monero – get to know HavenoBack in the days we were expecting that instead of embracing Bitcoin (then the only coin), states around the world would fight it hands over fists. Now, one can not say that fighting didn’t happen. But Bitcoin as is today, became part of the political agenda and finds itself in the portfolios of the largest funds – unfortunately more often than not under control of custodians. Because for better (decentralization) or worse (custodianship) BTC has a limited transactions capacity which forces it into custodial solutions.


##There are two fights

One for a store of value that can not be inflated at will (hidden tax). And another one for digital cash and privacy. Satoshi didn’t intend to separate the two. But the lack of fungibility and the inherent nature of blockchains helped separate the two ideas.

Bitcoin seems to have won the store of value contest. Which means there’s now a control knob on government and central banks inflationary policies. It needs to be seen, if centralized institutions might run afoul and reintroduce fractional reserve crypto banking down the road. 

**Bitcon is winning.**

And the state gave in? Or did it? Not so fast!

There is another fight. One for permissionless and private digital cash.


##Enter Monero. The one project most similar to Bitcoin’s story of creation.

Anoynmous founder… Left the project early… Cypherpunks culture ...

What we’ve seen with privacy coins in general and Monero in special is that the state didn’t give in, but instead turned all it’s power against what it represents. The freedom to transact privately between two parties without needing a third party nor anyone to identify or surveil the parties involved.

The last years of Monero history are full of negative stories

* Price suppression in cahoots with centralized exchanges
* Overreaching regulation of cash-like AEC (anonymity enhanced coins) - mostly in Western countries such as  UK, Australia, Japan and EU.

Which concluded in the delisting of Monero on basically all major CEX.

But in the end delistings are an overall good thing for both users and speculators who believe in the need of a cash-like medium in the digital age that doesn’t leave traces.

##Delistings….

* Increases privacy and reduce attack vectors
* Increases the need for self-custody
* Reduce market manipulation capabilities

all that at the cost of 

* Temporarily reduce liquidity and access

Monero is not yet winning like Bitcoin does, but delistings are not a sign of defeat either. Much rather they point to governments being afraid of it wanting to ignore it and getting rid of it. But Monero does one thing exceptionally good: Refusing to comply and refusing to die.


##The decentralized ecosystem

While Bitcoin’s success has been built around the advent of CEX and the financialization of it as a mainstream asset class, Monero is all but that.

Cypherpunks are currently creating decentralized, permissionless and private infrastructure like Haveno, a P2P exchange running over Tor around Monero.

So if Bitcoin was at the center of the centralized cryptocurrency ecosystem plugged-in into mainstream financial networks. Monero is at the center of the decentralized and private cryptocurrency ecosystem.



##Truly decentralized exchanges

Projects like Haveno make it easy to obtain Monero for any fiat payment method and any currency.

If you are ready to leave behind the cumbersome, intrusive and dangerous KYC (Kill Your Customer) processes of large CEX, Haveno will provide you with a fresh trading experience.

Not so convenient at first because it requires to rewire our own thinking process in regards to trading. But so far no one would want to miss the ease of a DEX like Haveno after using it for a couple of times. 

##How to use Haveno?

Haveno-reto is currently the only viable network running the Haveno software. It is „up“ for a little over five months seeing constant growth. You can download it in https://haveno-reto.com and it will run on Windows, iOS and Linux. Though you really should consider to run it exclusively on Linux for privacy reasons.

It’s easy to install it on an USB sick with TailsOS (Linux) alongside your main system. See below.

584,2024-11-06,"A muted response from crypto may suggest long-term market manipulation more than any point in history. The crypto bull market of 2017 and 2021 did appear more grass rooted compared to today. Commentary and speculation from everyday people on crypto was rife. Engagement on sub-reddits such as r/cc was through the roof. The markets back then definitely seem to be more reactionary to news. 

The vibe of this bullrun of 2024 feels distinctly different. Less noise, less visible engagement. Many could point at a shift to more institutional investment particularly in the advent of ETFs however the tapering of wider crypto engagement does seem a little odd. 

Love him or hate him, towards the end Trumps pro-crypto narrative has been the strongest yet out of any US presidential candidate in political history. When you couple that with the fact that the US is the world's largest economy and financial epicentre, many could argue that the crypto market should be going parabolic on his shock victory. However as I write market movements are fairly muted in crypto volatility terms with BTC +6% and ETH +8%. In past cycles this news against the odds would have sent markets skywards bullish 

It could be that this observation is premature and that's still to come. It could be that people don't believe that trump will really follow through on his pro-crypto narrative. It could be that people just don't care. However in the past reactionary news has tend to be one of the biggest drivers of price. Having a pro-crypto us president is arguably one of the biggest results for crypto in its history. As someone that's become increasingly cynical of the involvement of stablecoins within the crypto industry, if the upside move doesn't transpire I'd lean more towards the possibility that is more evidence of long-term market manipulation in this cycle than previous cycles.

**TL;DR**

In the grassroots hype cycles of the 2017 & 2021 bullruns news of pro-US president would have sent the markets to the moon. If this doesn't transpire it could be further evidence of long-term market manipulation, possibly via stablecoins. The questionable backing of many dollar pegged stablecoims could very well be FTX on steroids for genuine decentralized, open-source cryptocurrency projects and think it's important to differentiate/ disassociate from them until they are.

586,2024-11-06,"Can somebody explain leverage to me?So, I'm just going to ignore all the condescending comments saying not to do it, it's not for you etc. But go ahead and make them.

I've been playing around with the demo feature on Bitget where you can play at futures with $3000. I've made a few extra hundred so far. 

I'm just trying to understand all the features, the things like mark price liquidation price etc, but also just how it works in general. 

Just looking for someone who actually understands this stuff to explain a few things to me, namely where and what the risks are.

I watched a tutorial video that said it's safer to use isolated rather than cross at the start. So I'm doing that. 

I guess it's been easier lately because things are generally going up, but even so, I kind of can't work out how it can go so badly wrong for people. I don't mean that in an arrogant ""I'm so smart"" kind of way, I mean I just don't understand the maths.

So let's say I open a long on BTC with $1000 at 20x. I put a stop loss at maybe -5%, so I stand to lose $50 max (I'm not sure if that the case if I'm using leverage, but let me know. Also there was a post on here recently from someone who said that they opened it with only 1x and then increased it later, which makes even less sense tbh). Then when the price increases a bit, say by 7% , I move my stop loss maybe 5% above my entry price, so there's then no risk. Then after that whatever gains made are increased by 20x?

I mean, I just don't see how that can be true, so I think I'm not understanding something. It's like you buy something for $1000 and it goes up by $100 and you say to the exchange, nah but I want 20x the profit, and they say ok. I don't understand where the corresponding risk is. I guess it's something to do with liquidation price, but if the stop loss is set above that point, then how can you ever lose (unless obviously you pick every single trade badly and keep triggering small stop losses).

Or is it that, if I put $1000 on at 20x leverage then I'm only actually trading with $50, but I still stand to lose $1000.

596,2024-11-05,"Trip Report: Struggles of a new crypto userHi all, just want to give an idea of what it’s like for a new user of cryptocurrency.

Prior to this past month, I have never used crypto before. I however wanted to buy a knife on a game called CSGO in a third party market, so I decided to try out crypto to make my purchase.

I first research where to buy crypto, and find that one of the few available exchanges to me is Gemini.

I make an account, and submit my information and ID to verify. It verifies in 6 hours, which wasn’t a fun wait but whatever I guess.

I get back on my Gemini account and use my debit card to deposit. Deposit fails about 5 times, and after calling back my bank they finally let me purchase. That process took about an hour to figure out as a newbie. 

I then finally have balance in my Gemini account of $300, and make a purchase of Litecoin as my research told me this has some of the cheapest fees on its network when sending to another Litecoin wallet. 

It tries to only first give me like $280 worth using their autobuy feature, but then I realized you can go on the actual market itself within Gemini and I was able to get $300 for like $295ish. Kind of a trap if I really didnt look any deeper so bad taste in my mouth already from that

I then try to withdraw my Litecoin to the csgo market and I get a warning that my crypto is locked on the platform for ***10 DAYS*** and I cannot withdraw it. 

What the FUCK. At no point leading up to this was it ever mentioned I had to wait this long just to get my own crypto off the exchange.

Thankfully, the value of my Litecoin has gone up a bit since then but if it had fallen I would not have enough money to actually buy what I wanted.

I wait 10 full days and I finally get the chance to send it off to the csgo market and by that point the specific knife pattern I wanted was already gone. 

What a pleasant experience this was. I consider myself relatively tech savvy but this seemed quite complicated of a process with a lot of traps to avoid.

I’m unsure how the average public would even be able to use this, because my first experience honestly fucking sucked ***when I reallyyyy wanted to enjoy it***

617,2024-11-05,"Coinbase SupportJust over 5 months ago I sent Flare from my Bifrost wallet to my Coinbase account. The Flare was never received. I sent Coinbase proof from flarescan that I had sent it to the right address and they logged the problem and gave me a reference number.

More or less every month, I have asked for an update and been told that the technical team is working on it and to be patient.

Today I asked for a further update. Initially, I was given the usual story, be patient, the technical team is working on it. Then after a couple of exchanges where I said five months was more than long enough to fix the issue, I was told that it had been fixed and to check my account! Needless to say the Flare was not in my account.

I was then given a new reference number since they accepted that the problem hadn’t been fixed.

But it is clear to me that nothing had been done in 5 months and I don’t expect anything to be done going forward.

I’m hoping someone who has been in this situation with Coinbase before can give me some advice on how to escalate this. Who do you turn to? What can you do? Most on here will know what a nightmare Coinbase “Support” can be. Any help much appreciated.",positive,0.8283627,3

622,2024-11-05," The fact so many guesses and theories of ""who"" satoshi is leads me to believe that he will never be found, pretty much it's not even worth trying. I see a Fox news reporter accuse Satoshi of being a undercover CIA agent, I see countless of people saying they are satoshi, I see people accused of being satoshi saying they are NOT satoshi, I see so many countless theories of who possibly it could be (and some of them are really good guesses)

but at the end of the day, so many people, so many questions, so little answers, it just seems like a dead-end. We had since 2008 to figure out who this mysterious person (or people) is, and we have not even come CLOSE to even solving a clue.

Some possible options: The FBI/CIA/Government has cracked his identity somehow, and are keeping the info private from the publci, and/or we have mentioned/accused Satoshi of being the real person, but we just never truly knew.

Of course, I do not condone or think it's a good idea to always be stalking for satoshi. If he wanted to be anonymous, and left alone, then I think that we should all respect that. But same time, I do find it extremely interesting and amusing how Satoshi will never be discovered, and I will always find the mystery behind it super fascinating.

Unless Satoshi decides to reveal to the world his identity himself, if he ever does.. until then, Satoshi watches the world baffled by his existence and disappearence.",positive,0.68565303,45

633,2024-11-04,"We've gotta talk about Republicans and cryptoTl;dr: Don't vote based on your bags. Republicans aren't the crypto boosters everyone makes them out to be, and the way Trump has used crypto as a grift to make money just reinforces existing stereotypes about crypto being scammy.

I know, I know. We're all saturated with politics and election crap right now and we're tired of it. Me too. But I hear the idea that ""Republicans are the pro-crypto party"" all the time and it's just not true.

https://preview.redd.it/e9aor4poqyyd1.png?width=1196&format=png&auto=webp&s=f9d39dea07e453748665ef5d8328094120fbb031

First, Republicans aren't uniformly supportive of crypto and Democrats aren't uniformly against it. My no-talent ass clown of a Senator (Roger Marshall) is a hardcore MAGA Republican but wildly anti-crypto. He called crypto a [""threat to our national security""](https://www.marshall.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sen-marshall-cryptocurrency-is-a-threat-to-our-national-security/) and co-sponsored a bill with Elizabeth Warren to make stricter AML/KYC regulations. During the FTX debacle he even suggested that the SEC [shut down all crypto transactions in the US](https://www.semafor.com/article/12/02/2022/roger-marshall-kansas). Saying that Democrats aren't supportive of crypto isn't true either. When you look at the list of [congressional candidates endorsed by Stand With Crypto](https://www.standwithcrypto.org/races/endorsed), half of them (19/39) are Democrats. Not to mention that Democrats incorporated some crypto-supportive events into the [DNC convention](https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2024/09/24/how-democrats-have-shifted-on-crypto/) and [Anthony Scaramucci has reportedly been working with Kamala Harris](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/20/anthony-scaramucci-kamala-harris-campaigns-digital-asset-policies-.html) to develop pro-crypto policies. Saying Republicans are the more crypto-supportive party may have been true 5 years ago, but that has changed.

Secondly, we've got to talk about Trump. Saying that Trump is pro-crypto is like saying a bank robber is pro-unmarked bills. [His recent ""pro-crypto"" turn](https://www.axios.com/2024/05/30/trump-crypto-bitcoin-nfts) is at best a flip-flop and at worst a grift. In 2019 he said that [Bitcoin was ""based on thin air""](https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1149472282584072192?lang=en) and as recently as [December of 2021](https://decrypt.co/89108/donald-trump-calls-crypto-dangerous-even-as-melania-launches-nft), he called crypto ""dangerous"" and a ""scam."" ([And he would know!](https://apnews.com/article/17e975d3ccba4a92a9b023dff8437b21)) But recently crypto has been very kind to him. [One of his wallets](https://platform.arkhamintelligence.com/explorer/entity/donald-trump) has almost $6 million in it.

Not to be too much of a conspiracy theorist, but It ***really seems like*** after Melania Trump made an [unspecified (large) amount of money on a bunch of NFT projects in 2021 and 2022](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/commentisfree/2022/jan/04/melanias-latest-nft-is-selling-for-180000-at-last-one-of-the-trumps-is-showing-entrepreneurial-spirit), Donald [suddenly changed his tune on crypto and started issuing a bunch of NFTs](https://decrypt.co/249755/trump-credits-nfts-change-of-heart-bitcoin-crypto) himself. When the NFT market dried up, he pivoted and was [collecting 2% of every transaction on shitcoins called things like ""Trump Bucks"" and ""Save America""](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/much-donald-trump-made-nft-213019678.html) netting him at least a half million dollars. And of course don't forget about his newest ~~scam~~ DeFi project World Liberty Financial, [where 75% of all protocol revenue goes to the Trump family](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1g69fob/trump_family_gets_75_of_crypto_coin_revenue_has/) (who also has no liability) and who [couldn't keep their own website running](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/10/15/trump-familys-world-liberty-finance-token-sale-appears-to-go-live-selling-220m-wlfi-in-minutes/) during the rollout even though there wasn't much interest in the project.

I'm sure it's clear how I feel about him, and if you want to vote for him, be my guest. But don't do it because you think he's ""pro-crypto"" and will pump your bags if he's elected.

https://preview.redd.it/sxtxfrmk8zyd1.png?width=1192&format=png&auto=webp&s=51868abee8cbcf201081e38fb3ce5761066636a1

It seems pretty clear that he has no idea what crypto is or how it works. He [can't work a crypto wallet well enough to buy a burger with it](https://youtube.com/shorts/HIv4cwkz16U?si=2zjUCdPTnYVN9l_q), tweeted that he'll make sure Bitcoin is ""[made in the USA](https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1852033244729860397)"" and stumbled through a [recent interview](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/donald-trump-struggles-and-seems-confused-in-painful-crypto-interview-while-trying-to-change-topic/ar-AA1qGv5X), saying:

>""It's so important. It's crypto. It's AI. It's so many other things. AI needs tremendous electricity capabilities beyond anything I ever heard.""

At the very best, he doesn't give a shit and will forget about and ignore it once it stops making him money, which effectively gives other countries the ability to set crypto regulation and reinforces the stereotype that crypto is super scammy. This point has been made over and over, but if we want the industry to grow sustainably for the long-term, [we need clear, effective regulation](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2024/10/22/tether-ceo-ardoino-says-he-expects-us-will-catch-up-in-crypto-regulation/), not benign neglect.

See here: [How to Calculate Your Celsius Loss: Full Koinly Article Walkthrough With Examples!](https://partners.countonsheep.com/CelsiusBankruptcyGuide-YTR)

A few months ago I made this post, [Celsius Bankruptcy: A Comprehensive Guide To Calculating Your Losses (With Examples!)](https://np.reddit.com/r/CelsiusNetwork/comments/1fe7egh/celsius_bankruptcy_a_comprehensive_guide_to/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), outlining exactly how to calculate your Celsius loss for Class 5 Earn creditors (the majority of people). A lot of people responded positively to this guide as there weren't many resources available online going over the calculation.

After posting this guide, the team at Koinly saw it and asked me to author and update to their blog to include the detailed calculation.

649,2024-11-04,"Be wary of retrospective/backwards-looking analyses because they're easily very manipulated when there are too few data points/cycles**TL;DR**:

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Correlation does not imply causation

Most crypto predictions are retroactive studies that are cherry-picked to look good with past data but have no accuracy in predicting the future. They're complete guesswork and have a high chance of eventually failing in future cycles.

-------------------------

**Retrospective study**: A backwards-looking study that considers past data

**Prospective study**: A forwards-looking study that establishes a hypothesis first and then checks whether future data supports the hypothesis.

####**The problem with retrospective studies**

In general, prospective studies are always considered to be more trustworthy than retrospective studies of similar sample sizes. They are heavily affected by selection bias. There are exceptions for large-scale retroactive studies that have 10000+ data points that span decades.

In addition, many retrospective studies (especially in crypto) are completely manipulated because are **not properly set up with a hypothesis ahead of time**. Instead, they look for interesting patterns in past data until they find one. And then they establish a hypothesis AFTERWARDS to match that data. This is a huge taboo in statistics, and yet it happens all the time in crypto investing.

Using retrospective data to explain correlation without having a strong hypothesis created at the start of the study ends up looking like this XKCD comic:

https://xkcd.com/882/

Only the results that have an interesting narrative are published while the uninteresting ones are quietly discarded.

####**Too few crypto cycles for data points**

**Correlation does not imply causation, and past performance is no guarantee of future results.**

We really only have 3 past price cycles (since the 1st epoch didn't have stable markets):

* Epoch 2: 2012-2016
* Epoch 3: 2016-2020
* Epoch 4: 2020-2024
* Epoch 5: 2024-

A line can fit any 2 data points perfectly while a curve can fit any 3 data points perfectly.

That means any logarithmic, exponential, or 2nd-degree polynomial can perfectly-fit 3 crypto cycles. It's so easy to fit any chart type because there are so few crypto cycles for data points.

####**Prior notable predictions that failed**

* Rainbow Chart was plotted to perfect-fit previous cycles, and then it immediately failed before it lasted a full cycle and had to be revised.
* CBBI to perfect-fit previous cycles, and then it failed to last a single cycle because it didn't predict a double-peak
* It was said that no one who held BTC for over 4 years would have a loss. And then it was moved to 5 years, and then 6 years when each of those narratives failed in subsequent cycles.
* Bitcoin bull run starts 6 months BEFORE the halving is a false narrative that never happened
* Bitcoin bull run starts 6 months AFTER the halving is a false narrative that that only happened in Epoch 2
* Cycle dates are unpredictable:
  * BTC price hits a new ATH 5 days (Epoch 2), 145 days (Epoch 3), 85 days (Epoch 4) after the halving
  * BTC price hits a cycle peak 365 days (Epoch 2), 525 days (Epoch 3), 341/524 days (Epoch 4) after the halving
  * BTC large bull run starts -270 days and 225 days (Epoch 2, there are 2 pumps), -400 days (Epoch 3), 150 days (Epoch 4) after the halving

Just like before, many narratives will fail, and some will succeed. It's mostly just pure luck and guesses.

If you really want to establish a strong study, create **a prospective study with a strong hypothesis**, and then test it over 5+ epochs. Retroactive studies with few data points are just not trustworthy.",positive,0.90480584,6

* Too greedy you just want that 1000x project no need to DYOR, CT just tell me where to put my money, Lower the MK the better
* Too deep in the fantasies of what your project is overpromissing
* Too diversified in shitcoins (Warren Buffet strategy doesn't work in here)

If you ask what Bitcoin & Ethereum OGs were doing when they found those projects it was none of the above.

They were DYOR, talking to devs & reading the pros & cons of the projects, they all noticed how profitable it was to **mine** emphasis on this word. 

Remeber mining? Yeah that's what brought diamond hand into the projects, people that had to actually learn stuff to understand if the project was something worth their time, their effort, **to build on it**.

99% of these shitcoins around are just giving the tokens for free to VCs & influencers & exchanges, then overpromisse everything and never deliever besides more tokens on the market.

Was BTC & ETH like that when they started? 

  
Binance & other exchanges have not been anyones friend, they ruined this space along with ETH allowing so much shitcoin to popup as easy as one can fart.

The market is riddled with shit, and good tokens with good ideas will never be looked into because the market just wants that quick money. Let me tell you most of those stories of winner in memecoins are just marketing strategies.

The real winners are the tokencreators/influencers/exchanges, in few years retail will be completely drained at this pace, well at least stupid retail.

 

Now you think, but I have a good project!

Prob you don't, without mining there's no incentive to learn and build, devs will not join the project. If the vision is not clear & the utility isn't there then forget it. Bring on  layer after layer nobody gives a damn. 

Incentives are everything to bring talented people into your project **for free**

Now you're saying my project also has mining!

Ok, is the vision they promissed +2 years ago already here? This is crypto not a game that takes decades to build, if you have the devs & the money it should not be difficult to build.   
The only reason to drag stuff is no devs or  they noticed it wouldn't work but they don't want people to lose faith in the project



Good luck out there, I sure hope crypto can one day get back on track and ditch this memecoin shitcoin VC dumpsterfire shit behind",positive,0.9168608,0

723,2024-11-01,"What is required for crypto to be the future?This is a rant!

I've recently discovered crypto in a more deep sense. I absolutely love the idea of decentralized finances and trustless systems. The technology of block-chains is fascinating. However I have one issue, if we want to use crypto like we do cash, (buy coffee, a house, new shoes, etc.) what is needed to make that happen?

Crypto is extremely volatile right now. So it doesn't make sense to me to pay for things with (lets say Litecoin) when the Litecoin could be worth 70 USD one day and 35 next month. (I understand that the perfect scenario is everyone uses crypto derived from limited supply currencies like bitcoin, and thus we have a decentralized, low fee, hard money system.) But let's be realistic, crypto will not replace fiat money in our lifetimes. So if the (ex. US) is still based on the USD, and inflation continues to occur, how does crypto help us fight that? You would essentially need your L1 currency of limited supply to increase in price equal to that of inflation, otherwise your currency has just succumb to inflation. So how do we deal with this?

Ideally, in a world of fiat and crypto, I should be able to hold an appreciating base currency that grows equal to or greater than inflation of fiat money, and then swap some of the base to a stable coin whenever I need to make a purchase or just convert it to fiat money.

So how do we get to a point where the L1 currencies are appreciating at a rate greater than or equal to inflation in an given moment. If I buy into bitcoin and convert 70k USD to 1 BTC, and I want to buy something that costs 70k USD (1 BTC), but then BTC is worth 65K the next week, I can no longer buy that 70k USD item. If I were to put 70k USD into a stable coin worth at 1:1, I would succumb to inflation as I directly need as many stable coins as dollars. But if I use a coin that is some set ratio of an L1 coin then we have a hard money system. But that hard money system is still attached to fiat inflation and other movements.

So how do we preserve value in crypto while connecting fiat movements while preserving peoples purchasing power.

I don't know I feel like I've been thinking in loops. I think I understand crypto and I do understand the US federal reserve and the gold standard, I'm just having a lot of difficulty connecting the two and making it make sense. I'm liking missing something.

Like if I buy into bitcoin at 70k and wanna buy a house for 700k or 10 BTC but then BTC went down, well fuck I guess I just lost my purchasing power. But then oh wait I can now afford a 1.7 million dollar house with my 10 BTC? How is that a good store of value?",positive,0.89690506,14

739,2024-11-01,"Form 1099-DA Explained: How New Reporting Requirements Will Impact Crypto Investors (USA)*The IRS Form 1099-DA is planned to take effect January 1, 2025 and will be required for all digital asset brokers.*

# Introduction

The IRS has drafted the first ever tax form specific to crypto and digital assets. This form, Form 1099-DA, will fundamentally change how cryptos are reported to the IRS and individuals, shifting much of the reporting responsibility off of the taxpayer and onto ""brokers"". More on that later.

# Background

In April 2024, the IRS released the first draft of Form 1099-DA with requirements for custodial brokers being released in July 2024 and a revised draft of Form 1099-DA in August 2024. This form and associated reporting requirements will bring more transparency and reporting to the crypto space than ever before. For the first time, crypto transactions will more or less be treated similar to traditional assets like stock and securities when it comes to brokers being required to report transaction activity to both the taxpayer as well as the IRS. Effective for the 2025 tax year, the IRS will be receiving an immense amount of data regarding taxpayer's crypto activity.

# Key Points

1. **This form aims to standardize reporting requirements over digital assets, requiring all ""brokers"" to submit a 1099-DA to the IRS and taxpayer**. The IRS defines a broker as an entity that “regularly provides services effectuating transfers of digital assets on behalf of another person”. This includes exchanges, digital asset wallet providers that facilitate trades/transfers, and can even potentially include crypto ATMs. This, of course, raises a lot of questions for wallet providers and crypto ATMs that are not KYC. It is very possible that those brokers who do not collect the adequate information from the taxpayer to complete the 1099-DA will be out of compliance and could face legal action if they continue to serve US taxpayers.
   1. There has been some confusion around whether or not noncustodial wallets will be classified as brokers for purposes of these reporting requirements. [In the final requirements Rule published by the IRS in July 2024](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/07/09/2024-14004/gross-proceeds-and-basis-reporting-by-brokers-and-determination-of-amount-realized-and-basis-for#:~:text=Proposed%20§%E2%80%891.6045%2D1(a)), the IRS specifies that a facilitative service includes any service that ""directly or indirectly effectuates a sale of digital assets, such as providing a party in the sale with access to an automatically executing contract or protocol, providing access to digital asset trading platforms, providing an automated market maker system, providing order matching services, providing market making functions, providing services to discover the most competitive buy and sell prices, or providing escrow or escrow-like services to ensure both parties to an exchange act in accordance with their obligations"". While this language suggests it is very likely certain unhosted wallets *could* be subject to the 1099-DA reporting requirements, it is also important to note that ""unhosted wallet providers"" has removed from the explicit definition of ""broker"". This continues to be a grey area and we are eagerly awaiting more clarity from the IRS.
2. **The 1099-DA will provide proceeds, cost basis, and gain/loss details for each transaction** facilitated on the platform, as well as additional details. More on cost basis later.
3. **There is a new section for ""wash sales""**. The instructions read: ""Shows the amount of nondeductible loss in a wash sale transaction involving digital assets *that are also stock or securities for tax purposes*."" This is particularly confusing as we know [the IRS currently defines crypto as property](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/digital-assets#:~:text=For%20U.S.%20tax%20purposes%2C%20digital,%2C%20owned%2C%20transferred%20or%20traded). This likely means that, as expected, new guidance and regulation will be coming out explicitly disallowing wash sales for crypto. As mentioned in a previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1ge6i3r/what_to_know_about_the_wash_sale_loophole_tax/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), the wash sale loophole is still currently open for crypto in 2024, but is expected to be closed as early as 2025. This wording in the 1099-DA further solidifies these expectations. 
4. **""Noncovered Assets"" will be specifically identified and documented.** Noncovered assets are assets that the broker did not provide custodial services for or assets that were transferred into the platform and/or were acquired prior to 2026. If the box is checked indicating it's a non covered asset, certain fields in the form may be blank INCLUDING THE COST BASIS FIELD. This is extremely important to understand as the proceeds may appear as 100% capital gains unless you provide the accurate cost basis on the asset. This will result in taxpayers paying substantially more tax than they might actually owe. Taxpayers should not rely on 1099-DAs with missing cost basis data for tax owed.
5. **Brokers must attest to relying on customer-provided data.** There is a section where the broker will indicate if they have relied on customer provided data, such as cost basis. The ability to submit data such as cost basis will vary on a broker by broker basis. For example, Coinbase may create a feature to input your own cost basis on assets transferred into the exchange which will then be included on the 1099-DA. If that is the case, this box will be checked.
6. **Both stablecoins** **and NFT transactions are allowed to be aggregated (separately)**, as long as total proceeds is less than $10,000 annually. All other digital asset transactions will have to be reported separately.

# Implications For Taxpayers

Taxpayers can expect to receive 1099-DAs from various different exchanges and wallet providers. The forms received will also be reported directly to the IRS. However, for assets purchased prior to 2025 as well as all assets transferred into a qualifying exchange/wallet provider, cost basis data will not be accurate and will be left blank on the form. As a result, it is imperative that taxpayers maintain accurate cost basis records on their own and continue to report their transaction using Form 8949 (these 1099-DA forms do not replace the requirement to report using Form 8949 and Schedule D). 

# Comments

While the 1099-DA is going to help streamline data requirements, there are still many issues this will not solve. For one, there are various cost basis accounting methods available to taxpayers. The 1099-DA will default to First-In-First-Out (FIFO). However, a taxpayer may elect to utilize Specific Identification (assuming they meet the data requirements), allowing them to elect more favorable methods such as Highest-In-First-Out (HIFO), which may result in differences in what is being reported on the Form 1099-DA vs what the taxpayer is reporting on their 8949. While the 1099-DA will help bring a lot more transparency to crypto trading, it will not necessarily result in fully accurate tax reporting for taxpayers. 

Additionally, it is very important that taxpayers do not solely rely on the 1099-DAs, especially if transferring assets between wallets and exchanges. As mentioned, if an exchange receives an asset from an outside source, it will assign a blank/$0 cost basis to the asset on the 1099-DA. If this was provided to a traditional CPA or filed into turbotax, this would wrongfully result in 100% capital gain. Instead, the taxpayer should identify the cost basis on the assets transferred in and ensure they are correctly reporting it on their 8949. By maintaining accurate records for all crypto activity, taxpayers can ensure they have the proper paper trail to back up their numbers as well as ensure they are optimizing and minimizing tax due while remaining compliant. 

# TLDR

Starting January 1, 2025, brokers dealing with digital assets, including exchanges and certain wallet providers, must collect and report taxpayer transaction data to the IRS via Form 1099-DA. This form will detail proceeds, cost basis, and gain/loss, though gaps in cost basis (for non-covered assets) can impact tax liability. Taxpayers should keep independent records, especially for assets transferred between wallets,  to ensure accurate tax reporting.",positive,0.8909431,5

795,2024-10-30,"MicroStrategy's $9.91 billion investment is now worth $18,330,383,597, by only holding and not giving into FUDMicroStrategy currently holds approximately  252,000 Bitcoin.


Their average purchase price being $39,200, their investment of $9.91 billion is currently worth $18,330,383,597, as of October 31 2024, Bitcoin being worth $73,000.


We've seen people say it was a bad investment, that MicroStrategy was going to fail, and million other things, while they never cared and kept buying. They've doubled their money into $18 billion by purely DCAing and holding.


And we have no idea how high Bitcoin will keep going, as it's just getting started, and their profits might become even more.


Both MicroStrategy and El Salvador have made crazy amount of gains while both were criticised for their decision initially.


And the first few days of October had everyone thinking we won't get anywhere near the ATH, but it seems the market doesn't really care about TAs and what we think. Michael Saylors personal opinion was that Bitcoin could reach $13M each by 2030, so we'll see how that goes. ",positive,0.580006,282

***""*** *-* **Today, the crypto industry is developing rapidly, and with each new project, various marketing strategies emerge. Some use aggressive marketing that attracts a large audience and often creates excessive hype. However, it’s becoming increasingly more work for users to distinguish up-and-coming projects from those that rely solely on hype. How can users in the crypto industry avoid being influenced by aggressive marketing and approach investments rationally? What advice would you give to avoid falling for the hype surrounding ‘shitcoins’ and make informed decisions?**

*To avoid falling for aggressive marketing tactics in the crypto industry, users need to adopt a more critical, research-driven approach. First, they should focus on project fundamentals, examining elements like the team’s background, the project’s real-world applications, and its long-term vision. Users should also look for comprehensive white papers and clear roadmaps indicating a project’s commitment to transparency.*

*To avoid ‘shitcoins’ or projects based solely on hype, I advise investors to prioritise projects with robust utility, focusing on those that solve genuine problems within the industry. They can avoid impulsive decisions by setting clear investment criteria based on personal risk tolerance and joining communities to discuss and evaluate potential investments with like-minded individuals.""*

798,2024-10-30,Anyone able to recommend a course of action on this?Ok so I know people can make valueless coins for exchange between parties as kinda of their own currency but upon some skimming into how to actually make a coin and setup ways for people to exchange them seems like a massive complicated mess so I was wondering if there's any alternatives like a site or app or whatever that would allow me to make my own monetarily useless currency and have it be able to be traded between people easier than learning a bunch of coding or paying someone to do it all for me. I gather that probably doesn't make much sense so let me try and summarize. I'm trying to make a currency for a video game guild the players can exchange between themselves and idk how to do that effectively so any help is massively appreciated.,positive,0.91408545,0
