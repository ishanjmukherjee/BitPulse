3,1gunax2,lxvagm6,"tldr; Assets under management for crypto investment vehicles have reached a record high of $138 billion, according to CoinShares. This surge is attributed to $2.2 billion in investments last week, driven by looser monetary policy and the Republican party's recent electoral success. The majority of investments are in U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs, approved by the SEC, allowing both sophisticated and retail investors to invest in cryptocurrencies. Ethereum also saw significant investment, with $646 million flowing into related products.

Chainlink is going live with Swift next year so it‚Äôs 100% certain that Swift will use chainlink oracles for data. 

They still need a settlement chain but the chain in question will be anything connected to CCIP. It‚Äôs what the institution decides but with CCIP it doesn‚Äôt matter what they chose. We have already seen avax, base and eth so far as chosen chains. Specific chains will be used for different use cases according to Swift/chainlink.

The COIN50 is rebalanced quarterly and covers about 80% of the crypto market cap.

In layman's terms it's GME all over again. What happens is dealers have to hedge their delta so if you have a 40 Delta option. It means they need to own 40 shares to cover that risk and this is all done electronically. If the price advances and it goes 41 42 43, they have to continually keep buying shares to keep their delta risk neutral.

They need to make sure they can always support the debt, in all scenarios, and not over-leverage, which I am quite sure they are doing. Their leverage is quite modest, under 25%, and they are only taking new debt when the previous one settles. 2027 convertible notes are already eligible for conversion, the counters for all other notes are running as well (the share price is well above the targets). including the 2030 notes.

Saylor is simply front running the 2025 BTC bull market.

If anybody on this subreddit, or anywhere else, knew this, they wouldn't tell you.

You might as well flip a coin honestly - just either commit to investing or not, if you do invest little and often, if not stop checking charts.

Trade if you want but if you're asking randoms on Reddit what's going to happen to the [X] token price you're going to lose a lot of money - the people on this subreddit are generally extremely badly informed and also have a cult-like obsession with their favourite tokens, most of which are shit and don't do anything useful.

Nobody knows where the financial infrastructure will move, nobody knows whether bitcoin is going to be able to add a proper smart contract system, nobody knows whether BlackRock will start doing their accounting in Cardano (lol) - and for the foreseeable future everything will just track bitcoin anyway, alt coins are basically weird, gambly, leverage. If you think money's going to move away from bitcoin then the obvious choice is Ethereum or permissioned chains - Avalanche is yet another Ethereum clone with stupid subnet marketing glued on that nobody actually uses - all smart contract chains are just EVM clones and the only reason any are used is because gas is cheaper. There are 0 useful development or financial advantages to anything outside of Ethereum except hype and arbitrarily changed gas fees / tx processing speed at least for the next decade - when global financial infra has moved partially to blockchain then we can all start using fundamental analysis to figure out who's going to be the best chain - but realistically they'll just use some custom hyperledger solution anyway - why would they muck around with public nodes?",3,2024-11-18 14:21:58,1731961318.0,CryptoCurrency

They are a huge ecosystem with some incredibly bright minds and in many ways are setting the precedent and trailblazing for blockchain overall.  Other chains who built their chain with advantages over eth, typically did it based on discoveries the eth research team found or shortcomings that were exposed by them choosing to build and develop.

They haven't stopped.  They will continue to remove tech debt, they will continue to research and develop, and they will continue to get better.

I say all that to say, they're here to stay.  And they have been suppressed heavily this cycle.  The whales and market makers seek out opportunities to exploit and eth is essentially being primed to look too tasty to ignore.  The shorts build, the doubt grows, and at some point it's just going to require some fire being thrown on the gunpowder for it to get legs.  And when it does, people will chase the pump...they always do.  

Many of you on here are chasing it on other chains now.  The key to winning is to get in before the pump, not after it's gone up 50% in a week.  I know many of us bitcoiners want to claim eth is dead, but that's simply not true and anybody saying it is either incredibly short sighted, new, or in an echo chamber and not actually following the crypto space.",21,2024-11-18 13:57:20,1731959840.0,CryptoCurrency

Large centralized exchanges comply with anti-money laundering (AML) regulations, using tools like Chainalysis and CipherTrace to monitor and block 'dirty' coins linked to illegal activities. Monero, once known for its privacy, has seen its anonymity questioned, with instances of tracking by authorities and companies like Chainalysis. Despite efforts to ensure privacy, complete anonymity in cryptocurrency transactions remains elusive.

Pensions and reserves are flowing into btc as we speak. Even if btc takes 1 to 5 percent of the total amount of money invested into things, which it likely will, that will dramatically increase the price.

The real question is, ""Why doesn't it pop?""

Why doesn't Bitcoin crash back to $300/each like from a few years ago?

That's everything to do with the emission schedule and the hashrate. 

Everyone wants to own as much money as possible, therefore, will want to own as much Bitcoin/gold/silver as possible. 

That makes it inherently bubbly.

The thing that stops it popping is lack of new supply extracted cheaply. 

If someone can mine Bitcoins today at $100/each, you bet that Bitcoin will dump hard. But they can't. They can hardly get some at $50k+ each. 

And it's guaranteed to get harder to get new Bitcoins in the future.

This story is repeated throughout history. Glass beads in Africa stopped being good money when Europeans mass produced glass beads. Rai stones stopped being good money when technologically advanced folks mass produced rai stones. 

Gold stayed a good money because:

Gold is an element that can't be produced and is dense enough to be in the core of the earth. Naturally, it is scarce and can't be mass produced.

Gold is impossible for humans, despite technological prowess, to debase at any significant rate. 

It has a very high stock to flow, and it has a constant difficulty adjustment.

Bitcoin is the first time we were able to replicate it digitally because Satoshi figured out how to solve the Byzantine General's Problem. 

Crypto is a winner takes most game. Most forks like BSV, BCH, etc. all bleed against Bitcoin because it's extremely insecure. They could be double spent against, easily (rented hashrate).

Bitcoin continues to win because it has the largest hashrate advantage.

It takes a true disruptor that innovates a solution to a very significant problem that can steal marketshare from Bitcoin. The only one that likely will disrupt Bitcoin is Kaspa.",2,2024-11-18 01:01:22,1731913282.0,CryptoCurrency

In this sub, many people confuse financial value with consumption value. Bitcoin has no consumption value - maybe as a collectible for very few rich ppl - while gold has consumption value.

1143,1gtrvii,lxov8x0,First off I would suggest familiarising yourself with Capital gains Tax on the official government website. Up until April you get ¬£3000 tax free and then will pay 10-20% (depending on your income) on anything other that. From April 2025 onwards the allowance halves to ¬£1500 and the percentage will probably be higher. Not sure if they've updated the site with the latest Budget changes for 2025 yet. The good news is that you won't have to declare anything for this tax year until end of 2025. Other than that you'll probably need Kraken and link your bank account. Certain UK banks can be a problem. Depends if you're with a shit one or not :D,1,2024-11-17 19:57:06,1731895026.0,CryptoCurrency

This potential spike could be driven by recent all-time highs in bitcoin prices and the aftermath of the U.S. presidential election, which has already caused a surge in crypto prices.

This rise is attributed to the BONK DAO's announcement to burn 1 trillion tokens by Christmas, increasing scarcity and driving up the price. The coin's social dominance has also increased, indicating strong community interest. BONK's price is currently around $0.000050, with potential to rise to $0.000055, though overbought conditions could lead to a pullback to $0.000030.

This is possible because of Ethereums smart contract options. Tokens can be built on Ethereum using standards like ERC-20 - this is a blueprint for creating tokens.

If ETH fails, so do all the tokens that operate on it.  
If the token fails, ETH may or may not be affected depending on how important that token is to its ecosystem.  
If the token skyrockets in popularity and value, it would have a positive impact on the ETH ecosystem.  
But if ETH rockets, that doesn't necessarily mean every token that operates on it also rockets-- that's more dependent on that token's own value and popularity.

>The appealing story that is repeated over and over on Coindesk, CNBC, Forbes, Twitter, Reddit, YouTube is ""Solana is faster and cheaper than Ethereum and will replace this old tech"".

ETH had KOLer marketing dominance throughout last year and early this year. At the start of the year, it was a one-man team Mert doing most of Solana's marketing. Yet, it was during this drought of marketing, Solana did most of its outperformance against ETH.

Lightspeed podcast never had the viewership either Bankless or DailyGwei had.

>The Ethereum Foundation would not waste money hiring a team of communicative people to explain to journalists, economists, politicians, on YouTube,¬†

I had been paying attention most of the time. Polkadot and Cosmos both had a larger coordinated marketing push.  But where are they now? A lot of influencers simply capitulated to talk about Solana because that is where interest lies.

>so low that the operators colluded several times to halt the network, and recently to push an emergency upgrade.

The lack of self-awareness is the true Achilles heel for you all. How can you make these claims about Solana when all these ETH maxis are actively pushing activities onto Base and peddling Base products? How more centralized can you get if you want your chain to be dominated by an L2 managed by a big centralized exchange?

Now don't even make me get started about VCs' influence on ETH. A16z says jump and scratch your head, every ETH maxis jumps and scratches his head.

1539,1gtekwl,lxm2szf,"I‚Äôm bullish on Litecoin because it is fundamentally similar to Bitcoin, technically superior, widely accessible, and recognized by TradFi institutions.

If you had bought Nvidia stock at its peak in 2008, you wouldn‚Äôt have seen returns until 2018. Yet, those who consistently dollar-cost averaged, like many employees, achieved remarkable gains. Similarly, crypto is still in its early stages, with only about 5% of the world holding any form of it.

While past performance is not an indicator of future returns, an asset‚Äôs lack of performance so far doesn‚Äôt mean it won‚Äôt thrive. Litecoin is widely adopted, listed on nearly every Bitcoin exchange and service, and recognized by major financial institutions and platforms like Fidelity, Grayscale, PayPal, Venmo, MoneyGram, and Coins.ph.

Litecoin stands out as fundamentally similar to Bitcoin but technically superior in key areas:

- **Hard cap:** 84 million coins, ensuring scarcity.
- **Mining algorithm:** Scrypt instead of SHA256, enhancing miner decentralization.
- **Faster transactions:** 2.5-minute block times versus Bitcoin‚Äôs 10 minutes.
- **Efficient network performance:** 4x faster difficulty adjustments for consistency.
- **Low transaction fees:** Averaging under a penny, making it highly cost-effective.
- **Merged mining:** Combined with Dogecoin and Bellscoin, boosting miner revenue and Scrypt security.
- **Privacy features:** MWEB for optional privacy.

Considering these advantages, Litecoin‚Äôs current valuation seems significantly undervalued. Its solid fundamentals and growing adoption position it as a compelling asset in the evolving crypto landscape.",2,2024-11-17 10:37:15,1731861435.0,CryptoCurrency

1636,1gtcqod,lxl3ly5,"tldr; Bitcoin has surged over 30% since the U.S. presidential election, driven by high demand and increasing stablecoin liquidity, potentially pushing its value above $100,000. CryptoQuant analysts suggest that Bitcoin is not overvalued, supported by the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio. The demand for Bitcoin is growing, particularly from U.S. investors, as seen in the Coinbase Bitcoin price premium. Rising stablecoin liquidity, especially Tether (USDT), is contributing to this trend, although minor selling pressure from miners may occur.

This suggests that Ethereum bulls are optimistic about a potential rally towards $3,600. The current exchange inflow is valued at approximately $780 million, down from previous levels, indicating that most ETH holders are refraining from selling. Strong support is noted at the $3,075 level, with a potential rally if bullish momentum continues. However, increased selling pressure could risk a dip below $3,000.

**Traffic Trends:**  
- Their website traffic has been on a steady downtrend since 2022. ([Traffic example](https://i.imgur.com/eO4z0zw.png))  
- Most of their organic traffic is branded, which aligns with their peak popularity in 2021-2022.  

**Key Issues:**  
1. **Impact of Google‚Äôs Helpful Content Update (August 2022):**  
   - This update prioritizes content that is genuinely helpful and discourages generic or low-value content. ([Read more](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2022/08/helpful-content-update))  
   - Their blog content feels generic and AI-written, lacking authenticity, graphs, visuals, or actionable data. For example, this article could provide much more value: [Ergo vs. Other Blockchain Platforms](https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/Ergo-Vs-Other-Blockchain-Platforms-What%E2%80%99s-The-Difference/).  

2. **SEO Underperformance:**  
   - Out of 108 blog articles, only 8 generate any organic traffic, with just 45 monthly visitors across the blog.  
   - Basic SEO best practices are missing:  
     - URLs with capital letters and special characters.  
     - No timestamps on articles.  
     - Missing or poorly optimized meta titles, descriptions, canonical tags, and schema.  
   - For a deeper understanding of how to improve SEO in Web3, check out our guide: [Web3 SEO Guide](https://guerrillabuzz.com/web3-seo/).  

3. **Lack of PR Activities:**  
   - They rely on earned media from time to time, but there‚Äôs no evidence of a structured PR effort.  
   - Without a dedicated PR strategy, they‚Äôre unable to capitalize on the current market momentum, unlike their performance in the 2021-2022 bull run.

**Recommendations**  

- **SEO Strategy:**  
   - Conduct a thorough SEO audit and create a clear strategy focused on generating organic traffic.  
   - Improve content quality by adding depth, visuals (e.g., graphs, charts), and real data. Content should be written to provide value, not just to check off a box.  
   - Fix technical SEO issues like:  
     - Properly formatted URLs (no capital letters or special characters).  
     - Adding canonical tags and schema.  
     - Writing meta titles/descriptions that attract clicks.  

- **Authentic Content Creation:**  
   - Focus on creating high-quality, authentic articles that solve real problems for the audience.  
   - Include examples, comparisons, and original insights to make content stand out.  

- **Invest in PR:**  
   - Hire a PR agency or build an in-house team to generate consistent coverage.  
   - Target stories that increase awareness beyond branded traffic and position Ergo as a leader in the blockchain space.

1745,1gtb73x,lxkwxjs,"### Plutus: Marketing Analysis  

**Traffic Concentration:**  
- **Branded Traffic Dominance:** 99% of their traffic is branded, with 80% going to the homepage, ~10% to product pages, and ~9% to the blog and help section.  
- **Content Focus:** Their blog is entirely focused on their brand, without any content targeting a wider audience or answering common questions potential users might have.  

**Key Issues:**  
1. **Traffic Over-Reliance:** Almost all their traffic comes from people who already know the brand. This is risky in a competitive industry, especially if the market shifts.  
2. **Content Underperformance:** Out of 86 blog pages, only 48 are indexed in search engines, and just 7 bring any traffic. For example, here‚Äôs an article that generates no visits: [https://i.imgur.com/7aTW1Qg.png](https://i.imgur.com/7aTW1Qg.png)  



**Recommendations**


1. **Strategic PR:**  
   - Instead of focusing only on branded PR (e.g., ‚ÄúPlutus enhances Curve Perk rewards for premium users‚Äù), they should create articles targeting specific audience problems and search terms.  
   - PR efforts should link to various sections of their site, not just the homepage. This will drive traffic to important pages like product descriptions or features.  

2. **SEO Improvements:**  
   - Conduct proper keyword research to figure out what their target audience is searching for. For example, topics like ‚Äúbest crypto debit cards‚Äù could bring in new users.  
   - Out of their 86 blog posts, only 7 generate traffic. They need to optimize their existing articles and create content beyond just promoting themselves.  

3. **What is YMYL (Your Money Your Life), and why does it matter?**  
   - YMYL refers to content that impacts someone‚Äôs finances, safety, or well-being‚Äîlike crypto and fintech.  
   - Search engines (especially Google) are stricter with YMYL content and rank it lower unless the site proves it‚Äôs trustworthy. To fix this:  
     - Add detailed team bios with LinkedIn links on the About page.  
     - Set up Crunchbase and other profiles to showcase credibility.  
     - Blog articles should have authors with real credentials, connected via schema (structured code that search engines understand).

1746,1gtb73x,lxl18az,"**Secret Network (SCRT): Marketing Analysis**  

**Strengths:**  
- **Active in B2B:** Strong presence in conferences, regular partnerships with strategic companies, and active blog/social media showcasing these collaborations.  
- **Ecosystem Advantage:** Being on Cosmos provides a close-knit community and ecosystem support that helps with integrations and partnerships.  

**Key Issues:**  
1. **Lost Target Audience:** The focus seems to have shifted to partnerships and features, while their core target audience (developers) may feel overlooked.  
2. **Traffic Challenges:** Their website traffic is on a downtrend and appears to rely heavily on branded traffic, making them vulnerable to market fluctuations. ([Traffic example](https://imgur.com/a/420xh3L))  
3. **Limited Reach Beyond Ecosystem:** While Cosmos offers strong internal support, they haven‚Äôt expanded much beyond this ecosystem, limiting their exposure to new audiences.  

**Recommendations**  

- **Focus on Technical Content:**  
   - Publish **authentic technical articles** written by developers for developers.  
   - Showcase real-world use cases by having devs share their experiences building on Secret Network‚Äîwhat they built, how they did it, and the challenges they overcame.  
   - This approach will provide real value to their audience and help establish trust and credibility in the dev community.

- **Diversify Target Audience:**  
   - **Expand beyond blockchain devs:** Secret Network also supports Rust and JavaScript/TypeScript developers.  
   - Allocate resources (time, budget, and PR) to target these Web2 developers through meetups, hackathons, and tailored content.  

- **Shift Spending from Blockchain-Only Events:**  
   - While blockchain conferences are great, they should invest in events, PR, and content targeted at Web2 developers.  
   - For example: Sponsor Rust or TypeScript developer events, create educational materials on how to build with Secret Network, or host hackathons that emphasize easy onboarding for non-blockchain developers.  

**Why These Changes Matter:**

**PEPE: Quick Analysis**  

PEPE knows how to create hype (they can teach us all about marketing I guess) but I actually found one major issue:  

- **Homepage Not Indexed:**  
   - Their homepage is marked as ""noindex,"" which means Google can‚Äôt display it in search results.  
   - Evidence: [Screenshot 1](https://imgur.com/a/4cV1rYz), [Screenshot 2](https://imgur.com/a/uwdCUDu), [Search Result](https://i.imgur.com/QC6VWO0.png).  

**Why It‚Äôs a Problem:**  
- They rely on traffic from CMC, CoinGecko, and exchanges, but fixing this would bring more organic visibility.  

**Fix:**  
- Remove the ""noindex"" tag and resubmit the homepage in Google Search Console.",3,2024-11-17 07:15:30,1731849330.0,CryptoCurrency

So the existing shareholders have gone from having 100% of a $30B company to 93.3% of a $105B company, which is $32.7B. The existing shareholders gain $2.7B from the new equity that was raised.

I don't expect any institution to advocate for BTC (except Microstrategy, obviously), but I do expect them to advocate in their own interests, and BTC is now part of those interests. We can all look at the historical data, but none of it represents the circumstances we find ourselves in now. Historical data doesn't have Microstrategy and their 21:21 plan, it doesn't have ETFs, it doesn't have a fraction of the nuance we now find in BTC; the landscape is very different now than it was in previous runs. I'm not saying it won't play out exactly how it has historically, but I think there is a 'chance' we see something different, and relying on data from previous cycles that is not representative of the current situation seems a little too reductionist for me. 

None of us can predict the price, regardless of how many people are happy to speculate about it.

Not everyone will succeed because they likely will make inefficient decisions based on which coins they purchased. Some people will triple their money, some will fare even a little better, some will be ¬± 25% from where they started, and lots more will watch the entire bull run go by because they're waiting for the perfect price (i.e. Solana @ $1,000) and refuse to sell for anything less.

2069,1gt0v5i,lxiq6nr,"Wallstreet Bets Style Investment Thesis to Follow for Ethereum and some discussion of other alts

I have over the past 3 years of careful study of crypto markets gained enough conviction for a massive play. I‚Äôve been liquidating longterm stock gains as they reach stretched valuations all year. I am now sitting on a mound of cash (by my standards anyway). I‚Äôll be looking to purchase a total of $160,000 worth of Ethereum exposure when all said and done. Below I have included the basic tenants of my thesis and why now is the timing I have chosen (hint‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs all related to ETH/BTC).

Thesis tenants:

1. The market cycle top will be somewhere around Q4 2025 (post-halving year)-Q1 2026 as it has been in past cycles.
2. As QE approaches and retail investors return, altcoins will begin to outperform bitcoin as a whole market again (ALTSEASON).
3. Ethereum will continue to exist through this whole cycle (at least next 4 years).
4. ETH/BTC will top somewhere around 0.08-0.1 as it did last cycle.

IF all these tenants hold true, THEN Ethereum should hit a market cycle high somewhere around $10,000.

All this being said, I know there are definitely alt coins that will yield higher returns over the next year than Ethereum. The reasons I am interested in Ethereum over them are:

1. I do not feel confident being able to choose a small market cap alt that is not battle tested through multiple cycles.
2. Due to the size of this bet for me, I am looking for relatively low risk (at least in comparison to the rest of the altcoin market).
3. I can buy Ethereum in leveraged ETFs which I deem the safest way for me personally to take on leverage in the crypto market.


I believe that we are seeing amazing discounts in ETH/BTC right now and that it is going to set up quite a nice bull run for ETH once ETH/BTC does bottom (I think in next quarter or so at longest). There is a reason I bought over 50k of ethereum exposure last week aloneüò≥. 


I have done a ton of work to be ready for this move in my person finances. This includes my crypto YouTube channel I started a bit ago detailing more technical analysis and trendlines (although not my favorite tool). The username is @CryptoCrayfish3 and feel free to dm or drop a comment there or here.

2105,1gt0nka,lxk13f7,"So here is my thought on just this weekend's price action. 

Last week, Bitcoin went on a massive run up to 93K and basically all the attention was on Bitcoin with huge volume going into Bitcoin.  Naturally, alts started to bleed against Bitcoin all week long.  And finally, with the weekend, Bitcoin's volume started to go down and its volatility went down.  All the old-time traders know that this is the condition when alts run.  And alts have been running this weekend.  

But there was a twist. 

Usually, when something like this happens, ETH runs first, and then the big caps, then the mid caps, and then the small caps, etc.  But I think retailer traders saw through this pattern and the whales reversed it.  That is, notice that pretty much all the alts EXCEPT for the three biggest market cap ones (ETH, SOL, BNB) ran first.  And then, now SOL is running so what is left is ETH and BNB.  I think the whales conspired to reverse the order so people who parked into ETH after Friday afternoon got stuck holding their dicks while everything else mooned. 

Also, the nature of this weekend run. 

Notice that not everything is running concurrently.  First, it was like ADA and the likes.  Then, XRP, XLM.  And now SOL.  And while one is running the others are stale.  This is the sign of there not being enough capital to go through all the alts concurrently.  So there is a rotation of capital from one alt to another like a huge whale is bar hopping from one bar to another.  So what is the end outcome of all this?  At the end, once the SOL run is over today, it will go to ETH (and perhaps BNB) and then finally all back to Bitcoin to round out the weekend cycle.",14,2024-11-17 00:11:28,1731823888.0,CryptoCurrency

Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, who previously criticized crypto as ""worthless"" and ""fraudulent,"" expressed an openness to reconsider its role in the economy. This shift comes as the bitcoin price nears $100,000, driven by Donald Trump's presidential victory and expectations of relaxed U.S. crypto regulations. Trump's administration, featuring pro-crypto advisors, may further boost bitcoin's appeal as a strategic asset.

After the robbers fled, Leibov reported the crime to the police. This incident highlights the growing trend of physical assaults on crypto holders.

At ""Meta Day Argentina,"" Milei criticized central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and warned against government overreach, arguing that private cryptocurrencies offer a trusted alternative to state-issued currencies. He believes that technological progress in the crypto space can dismantle the state's monopoly on money, empowering individuals with economic independence. Milei's libertarian philosophy aims to reduce state influence, aligning with his administration's focus on privatization and deregulation.

Second one was: buy alts that newly came out after the last bullrun. They have fresh hype. If you look at Dot, Algo, Ada, Link, or any of the ‚Äúgood alts‚Äù that‚Äôre more than just memecoins, their value is nothing compared to what it once was, while other coins released later built on new and improved ideas have gained value much faster.

Sol has the reputation of ‚ÄúETH killer‚Äù. Whether it‚Äôs true or not, it has certainly performed a ton better than ETH; when stuff was dumping ETH dumped as hard, but when pumping it pumped harder than ETH. Even now you can see the difference.

SUI had good marketing behind it and some interesting technology, and since it is also quite new, it has pumped that much harder.

Third lesson is dump a tiny bit after every significant pump. Youll miss out on a bit of profit along the way but youll be much more sorry than if you hadnt sold anything and everything crashes hard.",57,2024-11-16 08:29:19,1731767359.0,CryptoCurrency

2880,1gsg9p2,lxje00g,"Okay, well in that case, consider how you would define fittest.  Or even survival for that matter.  In the context of evolution, the individual doesn't matter much so when you're talking about survival, what you might be referring to is the endurance of a species without major adaptive divergence.  The way the form of a crocodile has endured for millions of years without change.  But this same definition of a species enduring without change would apply to cave ecosystems that have been isolated from the outside world for millions of years.  Is a blind cave fish the ""fittest"" even if the slightest change in temperature or air quality would kill it?

Evolution doesn't prize fittness or surivival.  It's an extremely chaotic approach that fills every possible niche as fast as it can and the species that endure do so for a variety of reasons, but there's not a lot of evidence that suggests that that endurance is a positive thing.  Is the crocodilles' form better because it endured or is the crabs' because it keeps showing up as the answer to a lot of different evolutionary questions?  Some of the most successful branches on the tree of life are populated by creatures that barely look anything like what they did a few million years ago.

This is the problem with the ""survival of the fittest"" concept as an understanding of evolution or metaphor for other systems.  It's a fundamental misconception and usually, when it comes up, it is because somebody is justifying something horrible like social darwinism or eugenics.  We'd probably all be smarter if we let it go.

It's also worth noting that Darwin never said it.  His quote was ""It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent that survives.¬†It is the one that is most adaptable to change.""

Is it too late to buy in at current levels? *No.. but YOU take the time to weigh the risk/reward. No one can advise you on how much risk you‚Äôre able to tolerate . 

1. Do not dump your life saving into any investment because it happens to be trending on TikTok. Just assume all price predictions are wrong until they come to fruition. 

2. Set a plan based on realistic expectations. The likelihood that Bitcoin will 100x is low but greater than 0%. Same for Bitcoin dropping to $0. 

3. You don‚Äôt need $90k to invest in Bitcoin. Invest what u can afford to lose. You should also factor into your plan (2) that it may take a couple of years to reach your desired goals. 

Risk and uncertainty: in my opinion, Bitcoin‚Äôs risk profile dropped exponentially once the spot ETF requests were approved by the DC High Court back in January.  The only other risks that I see (albeit low probability) is if the new administration is unable to implement the plan to make Bitcoin a reserve asset, which I‚Äôm assuming other governments, state pensions, high net worth investors etc are keeping a close eye on.

Analysts attribute this renewed optimism to a more favorable regulatory environment and expectations of pro-crypto policies following the U.S. election. The inflows are also seen as part of a broader interest in digital assets beyond Bitcoin, with Ethereum being the only other crypto asset with an approved spot ETF.

Attackers use spoofed addresses and malicious links to deceive users into granting wallet permissions, leading to significant financial losses. Certik highlights the importance of user vigilance and recommends using tools like Etherscan to revoke suspicious wallet approvals. The Ethereum and Solana ecosystems are particularly affected, with scams often involving fake phishing wallets.

Long story short it's not going to happen because of:
* No benefit for the company/publisher
* Increased cost and maintenance of creating something like this
* Also lack of talents that are blockchain + game dev.
* Lack of incentive of different publishers and game studios to create a single standard that everyone implements
* Companies make more money staying centralized 
* And last but not least no one gives a shit, if I play cs2 I don't need nor want to be able to trade your WoW skin and vice versa. (And most players don't care, if you want to trade that stuff you usually already can do that right in that specific game)

The cost and maintenance of such systems can be minimized using scalable blockchain solutions like Immutable X or Polygon, and the talent pool for blockchain and game development is expanding rapidly. Also , why would it need a Blockchain + Dev game if you create a token for an existing video-game ? 

Interoperable standards like ERC-721 and ERC-20 already exist, and projects like Enjin and Gala Games are actively working on creating cross-game ecosystems.

Concerns about centralization versus decentralization can be addressed with hybrid models, offering token benefits while retaining centralized structures for stability.

Nothing, they make the game and can do what they want. A more useful question is what specifically will they gain by putting their things on a blockchain? If they don't anticipate a gain they have very little reason to do it. Would it be cheaper? Would it be faster? Would it let them do something they want to do but currently can't? 

When assessing design choices it isn't just about whether you can use a tool, but which tool is actually better for your purpose.

Bitcoin is a final settlement bearer instrument. Visa is not this. PayPal is not this. Credit cards are not this. Venmo is not this. Bitcoin is the digital instantiation of physically placing a gold bar in someone's hand. It can be accomplished with incredible speed by anyone with and internet connection with no need for a third party. 

People will often compare bitcoins transaction speed to visa. Visa has more in common with WhatsApp than it does with bitcoin. The comparison to make is to imagine the most remote person you can think of with an internet connection. Now imagine the difficulty of personally delivering them 1 billion usd worth of gold and bitcoin. No third parties, you must deliver it personally. That's the breakthrough.

Bitcoin is a paradigm shift in our understanding of money. The problem is, human psychology is fundamentally incompatible with paradigm shifts. People always prefer old tech they are familiar with rather than new tech with a steep learning curve. We are creatures of habit and prone to anxiety and fear. Every single technology gets adopted in a similar curve and pattern because the masses need all the supporting infrastructure in place before they're ready to join the innovators. 

Paradigm shifts are never embraced immediately and will always be punctuated by loud people screaming the rules of the last paradigm, saying this won't work.

Bitcoin is taking a long time to adopt because of risk. Adopting the internet was easy. There was extremely low risk for trying out new apps and new messaging systems. Now you have to pony up money to try the new thing.

Imagine the invention of electricity. There were no electricians. No wire manufacturers with good insulation. No youtube to learn how to wire your house. Using it was extremely risky and many houses caught fire in the early days. It took a long time between Edison and mass adoption.

Money has had very obvious properties throughout the ages. Bitcoin is the strongest expression of these properties. It is the hardest money we've ever known and the hardest money always wins.

So that's good, now you're finally truly curious, you'll be able to be a real, actual skeptic soon!

I'll give one tidbit - first off, Bitcoin is unchangeable due to the decentralized proof-of-work mining. It has an eventual fixed supply (there is a future point when no more will be created) and this is an immutable fact without spending billions and billions of dollars to set up enough miners to control a majority of the network. Studies have shown that you would have to spend more money than you'd gain by doing this - this as well as not being under centralized control which would make it an easier target for hackers makes the Bitcoin network secure. (Note this security doesn't save anyone from themselves if they fall for a scam).

So that's one of the most important aspects to understand: you have this asset with fixed emission and eventually fixed supply THAT IS NOT UNDER THE CONTROL OF ANY CENTRAL ENTITY and to make it better, IT'S PURELY DIGITAL  making it easier to integrate into our digital lives than certificates of gold ownership or some other shit like that.

Have you ever been pissed at the feds for printing more money and fucking us all up with more inflation? That is but one example of something that Bitcoin fixes. The way Bitcoin was designed makes it be like a rare commodity like gold that can be used as a store of value, but anyone can just on-ramp onto the network and use it without permission. Just need a wallet and to keep your cryptography private key safe (which is what is used to have control of a wallet). Even better, if you own Bitcoin and if your private key is safe, you are literally in possession of that commodity as opposed to gold where you go to an exchange, you ask for permission, you send them your money and trust them with it, then you ask them to pretty please buy gold for me, then they respond and say ""Ok! We bought gold for you!"" and you just have to trust that it's true. With Bitcoin, you can truly possess it if you want. If you buy it on a centralized exchange, you're free to send it to your own wallet that you control, and from that point, my man, you are your own bank and there's a whole other world called ""decentralized finance"" aka DeFi that you can take a journey into.",1,2024-11-15 07:29:51,1731677391.0,CryptoCurrency

Bitcoin is a deflationary asset as it's limited to 21 million coins (each divisible by 100,000,000, each unit being a Satoshi.

I've lived pre-internet, Web 1.0 (static web pages, basic search), Web 2.0 (social media, centralized data) and we will eventually convert fully to Web 3.0 (we aren't there yet). This is characterized by a completely decentralized internet. Instead of a few companies like Google and Facebook holding everyone's data (and selling it for marketing purposes), individuals will own and control their own data on the blockchain.

The biggest investment firms are now investing in Bitcoin because they see how it's deflationary (limited to 21million while paper currency just keeps getting printed at an accelerated rate making it more and more worthless as inflation will increase for an increase in supply). Once corporations discover the value in this, they'll start investing billions of dollars which will in turn cause the price of BTC to skyrocket.

Bitcoin will likely reach $10M for a single BTC once all coins have been mined.

Also keep in mind in Web 3.0 it will dominated by a new technology: artificial intelligence.

Bitcoin replicates that. It is actually even more difficult to flood the market with Bitcoins than it is with gold.

If gold became worth $ 1 million /oz, we'd be extracting it from the sea. New supply hits the market. 

Bitcoin is even more supply inelastic. There is no way to change the fact that only 3.125 Bitcoins come out as the mining reward. Even if every person on Earth had 100 ASIC Bitcoin miners, it'll still be the same amount. 

That fact makes Bitcoin more supply inelastic than gold. It means that when the price goes parabolic, it DOESN'T crash back down as far as you'd expect because the cost basis goes up so fast.

The ""unforgeable costliness"" means there's no one, not the miners nor the holders, willing to dump one on the market for what it used to be. 

Bitcoin also has a supply-shock event programmed into it. The rules of Bitcoin can't be changed unless everyone who runs a node (which is random and global) agrees to change it. 

The supply shock is similar to how egg prices went crazy during avian flu, not that long ago. Or how used cars got very expensive when we had a chip shortage for new cars. 

Prices for eggs came back down when more chickens (thus more eggs) came onto the market. But this doesn't apply for Bitcoin. Bitcoin's new supply NEVER returns to old highs. It only gets lower.

The demand for Bitcoin comes from the fact that your governments borrow money that doesn't exist, and corporations and households are borrowing money that doesn't exist to buy things. This effectively ""prints"" money into existence. 

In simpler terms, it is as if the globe was run by monarchs who decide that they should melt everyone's gold coins and add some copper/tin to it at an ever increasing rate. 

Scarce things that you can't make more of, including land, go up because the dollar/yuan/euro/yen goes down. The scarcer, the more affected.

3653,1grvnsn,lx9y9wh,"Bitcoin exhibits characteristics often criticized as being pyramid-like for several reasons:

1. **Social pressure and stigmatization:** Those who hold onto their Bitcoin investments are praised as ""diamond hands,"" while those who sell are often labeled ""paper hands"" and ostracized within the community. This reinforces a culture of holding, regardless of market conditions.
2. **Tax implications and risk:** Profits from selling Bitcoin can be taxed at rates as high as 40%, while losses are borne solely by the individual, with limited tax relief. This asymmetry can deter people from selling and realizing gains.
3. **Market dynamics and potential pitfalls:** New buyers are often accused of buying at inflated prices driven by FOMO (fear of missing out). Meanwhile, long-time holders may contribute to the perception of scarcity to sustain higher prices. When the market corrects, those left holding are often referred to as ""bag holders,"" enduring significant losses as the asset's value plummets.

This combination of social pressure, financial risk, and speculative dynamics raises concerns about the sustainability of Bitcoin's investment culture.

The value of Bitcoin is often tied to the very currencies it claims to replace, such as the US Dollar or the Euro. This creates a paradox:

* Bitcoin's worth is typically expressed in terms of fiat currencies (e.g., ""$30,000 per Bitcoin""), which means its perceived value depends on the strength and stability of those currencies.
* If fiat currencies were to lose value or collapse, it could undermine Bitcoin's pricing reference, raising questions about how its value would be determined in such a scenario.

This reliance suggests that Bitcoin‚Äôs value isn‚Äôt entirely independent but rather intertwined with the existing financial system it aims to disrupt.",1,2024-11-15 09:22:59,1731684179.0,CryptoCurrency

As OP seems interested in KAS as an investment, I will give some insight.

KASpa is a very young project, it could cease to exist next year or get to the top 10 regardless of the tech. What makes Kaspa rather special is that it's proof of work. That is, like for Bitcoin, miners got to invest and deploy expensive hardware to maintain the network and grab their due fees. So a thing to watch for is the harsh rate. A continuous growth is a good indication that the value of its token/currency is likely to increase. As for other indicators, well you do your own research. 

If you are not diversifying, grabbing a hefty bag would be pretty risky. High risk high reward of course, that would simply depend on your taste for it.

Another thing about Kaspa, I have not read the details yet but it seems like some significant hash power is going towards it or Bitcoin depending on market factors. That would explain why it pumps when Bitcoin dumps in value and vice versa.",4,2024-11-15 07:01:00,1731675660.0,CryptoCurrency

The BITCOIN Act of 2024, introduced by Senator Cynthia Lummis, does not propose the sale of the United States' gold reserves. Instead, it suggests revaluing the gold held by the Federal Reserve to help fund the acquisition of Bitcoin for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. 

Kitco

Key Points:

Revaluation of Gold: The act recommends adjusting the value of the gold certificates held by the Federal Reserve to reflect current market prices. This revaluation would increase the nominal value of these assets without necessitating their sale. 

Kitco

Funding Mechanism: By revaluing the gold, the Federal Reserve would issue new gold certificates to the Treasury, representing the updated value. The difference between the old and new certificate values would be remitted to the Treasury, providing funds to support the Bitcoin Purchase Program outlined in the act.

Although Bitcoin's market cap briefly fell back below Saudi Aramco, it remains higher than silver and close to surpassing the oil giant again. Bitcoin enthusiasts are now eyeing larger targets like Google and Amazon, which have market caps of $2.1 trillion and slightly higher, respectively. Bitcoin would need to rally 23% to surpass Google and 29% to overtake Amazon.

However, much of this volume is driven by automated trading and smart contracts, not human transactions. While stablecoins show blockchain's capacity for high-volume transactions, they lack the consumer-driven adoption seen with Visa, raising regulatory concerns as they approach mainstream payment networks.

They allege that FTX improperly liquidated 3AC's assets, which harmed 3AC creditors. The liquidators argue that FTX's actions were avoidable and unfair, and they are calling for the invalidation of these liquidations. A court hearing is scheduled for November 20 to address 3AC's motion. This lawsuit is part of FTX's broader efforts to recover crypto assets following its bankruptcy filing in November 2022.

Unfortunately it can also be quite an insular and inwards-facing ecosystem and community, which I suspect might be innately limiting to some extent. I wonder if it's maybe displaying a variation on Conway's Law where comms of an entity reflect the structure - but either way, it's quite self-referential, and there is a language and awareness gap to the outside world. In turn, that makes for a steeper than expected learning curve for newcomers.

I still hold DOT, and a few ecosystem tokens. They've all performed poorly compared to broader market over the last year. That said, I don't feel too concerned / expect some uptick at some point.

4121,1grko67,lx84q39,">1, DOT was a layer 0.

Ppl underestimate the curse of being a ""layer 0"" token. ETH is slowly walking into this problem.

DOT is NOT abandoned but it has a serious curse from it being a ""layer 0"" token.

Let me describe this curse.

1. DOT has no users. Its users are supposed to be on its parachains. But if your early parachains fuck up, then you have no ecosystem of users. Now if you have no users, then if old parachains die, new devs don't want to start new parachains to replace them if they can't find users in DOT. I saw it all play out exactly on DOT. A lot of fuck ups happened on early parachains. Then some parachains decided to become ETH L2s instead and fucked off.
2. DOT has no users and doesn't earn much real revenue, but it needs liquidity to fund ""public goods"" development. So, it borrowed Cosmos Hub's model of high inflation. It gives you high staking rewards from inflation. But when people cash out of those staking rewards, the price crashes because there is no real demand for DOT besides staking more Ponzi rewards.
3. Now problem 2 is compounded with ppl thinking this inflation is meant to sustainably retire ppl's lives off. So ppl just regularly dump DOT inflation to pay life expenses. Atom has the same problem. The price can't go up if passive stakers are leeching off secondary buyers liquidity in perpetuity to retire on.

Every chain trying to make a minimal base layer seems to suffer from this problem. Celestia is partially hanging on because the VCs are holding most of the inflationary rewards/unlocks and are circle-jerking themselves from crashing the price.

AVAX is partially escaping this problem because it has a C-Chain. But if activity moves off to its subnets, similar dynamics would end up playing out.

And ETH has a main net.

But it seems layer 0 tokens with minimal base layer are all fucked, e.g. DOT, Atom, Celestia, etc. There are too many incentives for independent devs teams building up on higher layers to spin up 1 gorillion different tokens to fragment attention and fund copy-and-paste protocols.

Layer 0 is a good idea if you can get a lot of profitable chains operating on you. But don't kid yourself. Most chain devs rely on selling their tokens to keep lights on - never mind profitability. That is where the equation breaks. Layer 0 is a business servicing a bunch of broke businesses that can't turn themselves profitable. Broke ppl can't make your business thrive.",14,2024-11-15 00:51:32,1731653492.0,CryptoCurrency

The reason is simple: it's science. Cardano is built on peer-reviewed research, formal verification, and technological integrity. This isn't just hype; it's a blockchain rooted in academic rigor and designed for scalability and real-world application. The foundation is solid, the potential is enormous, and the timing feels inevitable.

Chainlink was built on eth because it was the first smart contract platform. Chainlink is now chain agnostic and can deploy services on any chain, public or private.

SWIFT (11,000 banks) DTCC, Euroclear, Clearstream (all the largest banking/securities institutions) are all interested in CCIP, which connects their chains and provides data for the RWAs through chainlink oracles. CCIP is a separate network from eth and uses LINK as gas. 

None of these institutions that deploy their funds are working directly with Ethereum. Theyre working with chainlink because tokenized RWAs need to meet specific data requirements for banks to even think about doing it. if you think otherwise, youre delusional and misinformed.

Dogecoin just trades like an Altcoin in the top 10, as it is supposed to.

the scam tokens are getting pumped by their scammer-developers.

Nothing out of the usual. 

How would you convince your victims that you are not a scam, if you did not pump your own token at the beginning of the run? Can't cause fomo in your victims if you don't fake interest in your scam-project.

FBI has already uncovered how they do it and all the scammers that have not yet been indicted, eventually will. 

Juts look at Saitama Inu, which dropped to virtually zero when the FBI uncovered that they artificially pumped their own coin using illegal practices. Come first signs of an alt-run... BIG spike upwards, because scammers simply can't stop scamming. 

As long as the crypto community tells new traders that ""meme coins go up"", scammers will take those new traders money. 

The only way to change that is to educate new investors about these scams without falling into the meme-thinking of ""it's meme coins"".  

The Bitcoin Meme of it being the only coin and everything else being trash is just as much a made up coping mechanism as ""buy and hodl"" and ""to the moon"". Neither of those memes will help anyone....

Which is why the dogecoin community is making fun of such behavior, but since it has the reputation of ""using memes to express honest and deeply held beliefs"", instead of just ""making fun"", most of the people do not realize this.

The scheme, which ran from late 2021 to March 2023, promised 20x returns on investments in tokens that were largely worthless. The operation was led by an unidentified YouTuber with 620,000 subscribers, who also headed a fake investment consulting firm. The scam targeted over 15,000 victims, mainly middle-aged and older individuals, encouraging them to sell assets and take loans to invest. Twelve of those arrested remain in detention.

To remain competitive in the rapidly evolving blockchain space, Ethereum must embrace a clear vision and focus on core values. Proposed goals for the next five years include reducing block times to 1 second, achieving single-slot finality, increasing throughput, and enabling multiple concurrent proposers to enhance decentralization and scalability.

Apparently it is time to let go of your old mindset (man). Forget about the past. Imagine a new and more glorious future. And buy bitcoin.



This is a serious struggle for normies like me. Bitcoin is still not a proper currency ‚Äî try using it to buy a coffee or pay your taxes almost anywhere in the world. It doesn‚Äôt pay a yield or a dividend or provide a claim to anything other than itself. The ecosystem around it is peppered with wholesome, sensible people but dominated by cranks and grifters, especially as you look past bitcoin and into the vast universe of smaller tokens and coins. 



But even I have to admit that the rally since the re-election of Donald Trump as US president is something special ‚Äî a big bang moment that is impossible to ignore. The price has vaulted over $90,000 for the first time, marking a rise of over 34 per cent since election day, which, as a reminder, was just last week. A target of $100,000 by the end of this year is not outlandish. What a time to be alive and what a payday for bitcoin holders.



Analysts at Bernstein are not holding back. ‚ÄúWelcome to the crypto bull market,‚Äù they wrote in a note on Monday. ‚ÄúBuy everything you can‚Äâ.‚Äâ.‚Äâ.‚ÄâWe recommend investors who have so far remained shy of any crypto exposure due to regulatory concerns ‚Äòinvert their mental model‚Äô.‚Äù



Think of the volatility that speculating on crypto injects into a portfolio, cautions UBS. ‚ÄúWe are sceptical that crypto assets can make significant inroads in meaningful and disruptive real-world use cases,‚Äù it adds.



Any effort to come up with a macroeconomic rationale for the price of crypto is also a path to madness. But let‚Äôs do what Bernstein suggests and think differently. This rally is about two powerful forces: vibes and vision. 



Vibes have always accounted for a good portion of the ups and downs in crypto. In this case, Trump surrounded himself during the election campaign with crypto true believers. He attended the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville, described by Bloomberg as a ‚ÄúMAGA-fied crypto lovefest‚Äù. 



Along with his sons, he backed a new crypto venture called World Liberty Financial. Elon Musk, high priest of crypto, was one of his biggest backers. The token Musk frequently boosts, Dogecoin, or Doge for short, has gained 145 per cent since election day. Musk has been chosen to lead a ‚Äúdepartment of government efficiency‚Äù, or Doge for short.



All of this and more points to a new administration that is crypto friendly and in no mood to regulate it out of existence. The vibes are good. ‚ÄúPeople are going crazy,‚Äù said Ilan Solot at brokerage Marex.



The vibe shift means that even conservative investors are increasingly willing to give crypto a chance. ‚ÄúThis is a global portfolio rebalancing,‚Äù Solot said.



Farnborough-based pensions consultant Cartwright says that even before the US election, it advised the first ever UK pension scheme ‚Äî a ¬£50mn defined-benefit company scheme of the type that would typically rely heavily on boring old government bonds ‚Äî to put 3 per cent of its portfolio directly in to bitcoin.



‚ÄúPensions and institutional investors have got loads of different asset classes,‚Äù said Sam Roberts, a director at Cartwright. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre saying bitcoin should be on the list.‚Äù The unnamed pension scheme he advised bought bitcoin in October and has scooped up enormous winnings since.



The broader vision is that Trump 2.0 could treat crypto not just as a speculative wheeze but as a strategic imperative. Robert F Kennedy Jr, once a rival and now a potential pick for high office, spoke at length at that Nashville conference about the need to build up national reserves of bitcoin, on a scale that rivals gold reserves. ‚ÄúIt was a mind-blowing speech. He had really done his research,‚Äù said Richard Byworth at Swiss financial group Syz Capital. This plan could potentially start with declining to sell crypto assets seized by the federal government over the years but later expand, Kennedy said, to buying hundreds of bitcoin every day. It may be a struggle to take literally someone who opposes vaccines and wants to remove fluoride from the water system, but again: new thinking. 



Byworth reckons some of the frenzied bitcoin buying in recent days is the work of other nation states around the world keen to get in before Uncle Sam starts buying. Whether this vision comes to fruition or not, ‚Äúthey are adding bitcoin as if this is on the cards‚Äù, he said.



Those of us still waiting for a clean articulation of what bitcoin is will remain frustrated. But it‚Äôs getting harder every day to fight against the crypto revolution.",59,2024-11-13 17:39:14,1731541154.0,CryptoCurrency

Binance experienced the most liquidations, followed by OKX and Bybit. After peaking at $93,400, Bitcoin corrected to $92,462, marking a 5.5% increase in 24 hours and 24% over the week. Analysts predict Bitcoin could exceed $100,000, with some forecasting a rise to $130,000. Notably, Robert Kiyosaki plans to accumulate Bitcoin until it reaches $100,000, while Arthur Hayes suggests potential for BTC to hit $1 million under certain economic policies.

Watch out for all those recovery scammers hitting you up.    
  
Just as an FYI, recovery of funds involves two key factors:  
\- The active involvement of a law enforcement agency  
\- Your stolen funds end up at a centralized exchange governed by international financial regulation

Unless both of these conditions are met, the likelihood of recovering your funds is slim.

The scammer's try to obfuscate their trail but Ultimately, they need to cash out at an exchange. Exchanges require a KYC process.

5676,1gqfnzb,lwxqbvs,"UK is the second largest crypto market in the world which is surprising as the authorities seem to hate on it. 

For those not from the UK most people will be doing this is because the UK government are starting to hammer capital gains taxes, which is an issue for those with the best performing asset of the past decade and a half. 

Retail investors have a tax efficient investment account called an ISA.. Anything held within it is shielded from capital gains tax. It would be ideal if Bitcoin trades/purchases/ sales were exempt from taxation or if there was at least Bitcoin ETFs however the UK have blocked ETFs.  So one workaround is simply to buy shares in MicroStrategy. It's currently the most/ only tax efficient pro-crypto move to make in the short term until governments stop attacking Bitcoin with taxation. The current choices are you either shield from tax, you give the government money for nothing or you try hide it and risk going to jail.",10,2024-11-13 10:20:18,1731514818.0,CryptoCurrency

There were no findings or allegations of fraud or recklessness against Ripple, or findings that anyone suffered any financial harm.

The overall crypto market cap is around $2.98 trillion, with a 31% increase in trading volume. Bitcoin inflows are strong, and the Fear & Greed Index is at 'Extreme Greed.' Bitcoin's price is around $88,900, with potential resistance as investors take profits. Despite skepticism, Bitcoin's upward trend continues. Diversification with altcoins is advised, but Bitcoin should remain a portfolio staple. MicroStrategy's Bitcoin investments highlight the benefits of dollar-cost averaging. Solana and Ethereum show growth potential, and BlackRock's significant buy orders indicate rising institutional interest.

Will institutional investors who hold the ETFs rotate out of BTC and ETH into altcoins? Probably not. However, some large whales who hold spot positions in BTC and ETH will likely seek further gains by going further up the risk curve.  The same concept applies to Sharks, Dolphins, Fish, Octopus, Crabs and Shrimps lol.

Part of this comes from unrealized paper profits. When investors see their portfolios going up, they feel more confident in taking on more risk elsewhere. Some investors will realize profits by selling some or all of their positions. Everyone is different in their approach. Some investors might be satisfied with just realizing a portion of their portfolio in profits and then moving back to the sidelines without rotating / re-investing. Some might not sell anything at all.

I know some people don't like Raoul Pal. I personally enjoy his content even though I'm not a Solana maxi like him. That said, you can learn about how some billionaires think when you watch their content. He rotated out of ETH to make a make a bet on SOL in the bear market of this cycle (he was big on ETH in the 2020-2021 cycle). Now he's rotated some of his gains in SOL to SUI.  That doesn't mean everyone should copy him. My point here is this is how some whales and institutional players play the game.

As other have mentioned, there's also the variable of retail who show up late who feel like they've missed the boat on BTC, so they jump on board whatever else hasn't set sail yet.

Not terribly important to the point, but I would dispute that r/CryptoCurrencyMemes has not caught on. Other than our new sub r/CryptoHelp, it's been the best growing subreddit in our network https://i.imgur.com/Upqz2Hm.png Just like any crypto sub, it slowed during the bear or crab months, but it's picked up when the market has.

95% of the moderation of r/CCMemes has been deleting memes that are meant to advertise and usually don't even have any humor. That would be a very negative stream of content to add to r/CC.

Despite this achievement, Bitcoin's market cap remains significantly lower than gold's $17.594 trillion. Analysts warn of potential resistance due to elevated funding rates and market euphoria, while key macroeconomic events could influence future price movements.

Value accrual comes from a network of old buyers holding tokens and converting new buyers to buy tokens. The price of a token is a function of its potential to grow its network of holders and old holders‚Äô conviction to keep holding the token.

This is why Bitcoin does really well. It is able to convert a legion of strong hands who don‚Äôt sell. And it is able to convert influential ppl to introduce products and push them for outsiders to buy, e.g. ETFs.

This video gives a nice tidbits about how price really appreciates in crypto: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=6nqzwdGxTGc&pp=ygUKbXVyYWQgMjA0OQ%3D%3D

Ethereum‚Äôs trouble is its marketcap is so close to Bitcoin. And Ethereum‚Äôs network of holders isn‚Äôt as strong as Bitcoiners. Bitcoiners buy on the premise to just hodl and patiently wait for price appreciation. They have fewer conditionals to waiver on their conviction to hold Bitcoin.

I suggest: what percentage of your money total do you want to allocate as a hedge vs inflating away fiat with political risks of a govt in question? 0% is very likely a wrong answer. 0.01%? 0.1%? 1%? 10%? More? Percentage should get bigger only if you properly understand benefits/risks of both parts of the total. Act like a hedge fund of your own assets

What are benefits/risks of keeping your money in fiat? What are benefits/risks of keeping your money in crypto? What are benefits/risks of keeping your money in precious metals?

> But i dont understand crypto

Then learn first and allocate capital later

> How can you make long-term gains? 

My perspective very simply put: Bitcoin supercycles driven by fixed known diminishing growth of the supply, each 4 years it is cut in half. To see it on the graph, google Bitcoin price for all its history and choose Log scale. So one may speculate long-term: convert fiat into crypto in arbitrary regular portions on the descent and inverse on the ascent, in case of success increasing piles of both. Don't try to time the market, you likely will burn like the majority who do.

DOGE's open interest reached a new high of $2.26 billion, and its daily trading volume hit a yearly high of $13.96 billion. Musk's involvement, including his proposed 'Department of Government Efficiency,' has fueled interest in DOGE, aligning with the meme coin's ticker and boosting bullish sentiment.

The FED's proposed CBDC is deliberately designed to fail before any serious attempt to implement it. The FED will own the CBDC money, but will not provide customer service. The FED will contract customer service to retail banks, and will probably pay them fees. But the documents propose that the retail banks provide the service, and mention nothing about fees. They might be hoping that the banks charge cost-recovery fees to the customer. This would destroy adoption. The FED might be planning to pay a nominal fee to the banks. No banks would sign up to that, because their services would have an open-ended cost, probably higher than the proposed fees. Also, because the FED owns the CBDC money, the bank's only role is service. There's no opportunity for the bank to earn interest  

Treasury bureaucrats have deliberately constructed this design to fail before implementation, because they don't want a CBDC

but the more popular a trend becomes, the less fulfilling it becomes -- if everyone knows when the music will stop, nobody will pick up the hot potato.  so ""typically crashes in september"" becomes a july/august crash as people seek to avoid the crash.  then september becomes rebound ""buy the dip"" month.  and that's weird.

so here's what IS known:

economy is strong if the S&P is strong -- if NASDAQ sees growth in the tech companies, that's a lot of ""tech money"" gains to place somewhere -- that money often is people taking their winnings to bitcoin.

so market up?  -- bitcoin up.

bitcoin profits?  -- people tend to take those to (specifically) Ethereum.

if the market is still strong, btc and eth are growing, then people will open channel four and start PRINTING MONEY on the shitcoins.  because a healthy btc might double, but a healthy ethereum could triple.  ...and healthy alt coins could go 10x if not 200x.

so where does it crash?

when the economy crashes.  in 2022 the tech boom had overshot it's expectations.  companies were leaking money.  tens of millions on salaries to make the internet more prominent in a world where people just wanted to go outside again.  netflix, google, twitter, disney, all laying off en masse... and the promise of AI and the proliferation of it was meant to reignite hope in a tech-future.

but these things take time.  the bubble had burst.

now?  this run is just a trump celebration as people hope he'll be a de-regulations president and the economy will churn.  ie, it's 2005 and banks are lending mortgages more than ever!  make money while you can!  republicans don't do ""soft landings.""

make your money and get out.

When your mom starts asking about bitcoin, it‚Äôs time to sell.

Bitcoin pump is going to end precisely when DJT becomes president.

The only take away I really have is if you make good money, be happy you made good money and don't overthink it, you're never going to get this perfect.

If your assumption is that crypto will do well long term then your goal should not be to get rich quick in a short period of time. Your goal should be growing a long term position through gradual investing over a longer period of time.

This rise is part of a broader crypto rally following Donald Trump's election victory and a Federal Reserve rate cut. SOL's price has increased by 34% over the week, outperforming Bitcoin and the CoinDesk 20 Index. The token's all-time high was $260, and analysts suggest it could reach this level again soon. Solana's growth is attributed to its strong ecosystem and resurgence in decentralized finance activity.

>>For the record, VanEck believes SOL is a commodity, much like BTC and ETH. This belief is informed by evolving legal perspectives, where courts and regulators have begun to recognize that certain crypto assets may function as securities in primary markets but behave more like commodities in secondary markets. Also, over the past year Solana has made substantial progress in decentralization; the top 100 holders now control approximately 27% of the supply, a significant reduction from a year ago. Moreover, the top 10 addresses now hold less than 9%. With over 1,500 validators across 41 countries, operating in more than 300 distinct data centers, Solana boasts a Nakamoto Coefficient of 18‚Äîsurpassing most networks we monitor. The upcoming Firedancer client will further bolster decentralization, ensuring no single entity can dominate the blockchain. This decentralized infrastructure, combined with SOL's utility and economic role, aligns it closely with digital commodities like BTC and ETH. We remain committed to advocating this position alongside our exchange partners to the appropriate regulators

Despite a recent inflationary trend in ETH supply, market sentiment remains optimistic, with analysts predicting further price increases and potential new all-time highs.

BTC rose 4%, extending its 7-day gains to over 16%. The rise followed a week marked by Donald Trump's election as U.S. president and a 25 basis point rate cut by the Federal Reserve, both seen as bullish by traders. Weekend pumps are typically bullish in the crypto market due to lower trading volumes and liquidity, leading to more volatile price movements.

He suggests halting enforcement actions against crypto entities lacking fraud allegations and calls for clear regulations. Trump's administration aims to boost the US crypto industry, and Uyeda aligns with this vision, emphasizing the SEC's role in executing the mandate.

For example, let's say I've managed to accumulate $10 worth of Ada at an average of 30 cents. Once it hits the 60 cents mark, I will take out the principal, i.e $10 and then slowly keep taking profits in instalments till the end of the run. 

This is of course contingent on consistently investing during the bear market, and getting in at good price points. Also, you may miss out on massive returns. But I believe that it's better not to lose sleep over profits that you could've potentially made than to lose money on an investment. The market will always provide opportunities, we need to have a long term vision and always try to keep enough cash in hand so that potential opportunities can be explored.",9,2024-11-10 01:46:45,1731224805.0,CryptoCurrency
8847,1gnuhu4,lwdps67,"If you were  in in 2020 you had a massive profit in 2021. I swear this happens every time with people who start in a really good place during a cycle and then they ride it up and ride it down. 

It's beginning to go up again, why would you sell now? All you're going to do is buy it back in at a higher price in a few months, feel really good about it and then ride it back down again. Like that's seriously what people do

It does however help a lot to have a goal in mind. Think about what that is, develop one and DCA out on your way to achieving it. Most the time there are at least three waves up so the first one above the old all-time high is probably going to be a 100k. People are probably going to be selling 95. After that it kind of depends on momentum but 140 would be a target, after that it's definitely no man's land. It could go on a parabolic blow off and double again, it could go a little bit higher and then do a 2021 fake out dip. In fact that could happen at any time including that 100K. 2021 was terrible, that massive drop resembled the beginning of a bear market.

Best case scenario: Less restrictive crypto regulation, clear rules by the SEC so devs don't need to fear getting randomly sued, and crypto seized by law enforcement will flow into a strategic reserve fund (I don't believe the US will actually buy new BTC for that).

The bank predicts Bitcoin will reach $200,000 and Ethereum $10,000 by the end of 2025. Factors contributing to this growth include potential regulatory changes, favorable stablecoin regulations, and a softer SEC stance on digital assets. The report highlights strong growth potential for sectors like gaming and tokenization.

Yes, Kraken does support U2F (Universal 2nd Factor) for two-factor authentication (2FA). This includes using security keys like YubiKey, which provide a physical second layer of security in addition to your password. You can set this up in your Kraken Security settings under 2FA options.
Using U2F security keys for 2FA offers strong protection for your account, as access requires both something you know (your password) and something you have (the security key).

Don't tell your friends and family. 

We crypto people are very into this game and we are sure it is the future. That often results in the urge of telling people around us about crypto and why it is so cool. If you tell them and start to ""preach"" you will have partly responsibility for their losses... not in reality, but in their mind.
Remember everyone is responsible for his own actions... People tend to forget this and will get mad at you.

9223,1gnfrkb,lwb9n7a,"A few extras I would like to add:

1. Always send a test transaction and check the entire address you are sending to, not just the first and last digits. 


2. Research the psychology of investing in crypto. The volatility is insane and I have experienced losing 60% - 70% of the value of my portfolio in the bear market. Downside volatility makes you want to sell and upside volatility makes you want to buy. Learning to do the opposite is a muscle you need to train. 


3. Set a long time horizon and don't invest money you would need to access within that window of time. 


4. Learn about blockchain and understand the fundamentals of the technology. Know the difference between keeping your crypto on an exchange, in a warm wallet and in a cold wallet. Weigh up the pros and cons of all options and the risks each option has.",21,2024-11-09 15:36:28,1731188188.0,CryptoCurrency

The sale, conducted between June 19 and July 12, generated $2.8 billion from assets seized in the 'Movie2k' criminal case. Under German law, assets must be sold if their value fluctuates by over 10% to prevent losses. The missed profits highlight the financial impact of the early sale amid a market surge influenced by Trump's re-election and pro-crypto policies.

If i build a phone, to let criminals communicate via P2P and enable their illicit networks to grow, i can't say ""hey, i just provide a secure communication layer"". 

If you turn a blind on where the funds are from, you're part of it. And this really depends on every countries jurisdiction.  

CreditCard companies are liable if their layer is used for childporn for example. They could also claim ""hey, we don't know as we just provide a service"".

The company holds around 214,000 Bitcoins, valued at over $7.4 billion, with plans to increase its holdings. Saylor's strategy has faced skepticism, but Bitcoin's recent performance has bolstered MicroStrategy's position as a major corporate Bitcoin holder.

Initially, the hackers demanded a ransom of $125,000 in baguettes, but later changed their demand to Monero cryptocurrency. The attack involved stealing 40 GB of sensitive data. Schneider Electric confirmed the breach but stated that its products and services remain unaffected. The unusual ransom demand appears to be a strategy to gain media attention for the hacker group.

This surge comes as Ether's price nears the $3,000 mark for the first time since August. The inflows follow a week where ETHA accumulated $84.3 million. The increase in inflows coincides with Donald Trump being declared the 47th president of the United States, which traders have linked to the spike. Other Ethereum funds also saw significant inflows during this period.

Does that mean i can send it from mexc to uniswap and essentially earn almost 17% just by transferring my coins from mexc to uniswap?

I'm still confused how ICP does wildly different things.

Can you have all the decentralised apps like eBay, Twitter etc on Ethereum as well? So is the main difference as.you are saying just how it stores the data and this security aspect?

Is there any wildly different use cases? For example ETH is wildly different from BTC as it allows smart contracts.

9690,1gmu8es,lwh631d,"You're welcome - thanks for asking and being open minded about ICP.

> Can you have all the decentralised apps like eBay, Twitter etc on Ethereum as well? 

Put simply - no, you cannot have all this on top of Ethereum.  If you wanted to build an ""ETH eBay"" it would all be built on AWS and then once a token transfer had to happen that's when ETH is called.  99% of it is off chain.  This is how all the chains dApps really work.

On ICP inside of a canister smart contract you put your database, code, storage, web pages, etc. entirely on the chain itself.  There's no need for any outside cloud services.  It's 100% onchain.  ICP is also running AI onchain as well and it's improving pretty quickly.

The use cases for ICP are basically endless while traditional blockchains are really just moving tokens around.  You don't need firewalls or anti-virus like you do on traditional web2 architecture:

>Tamperproof architecture: Systems and services built on the Internet Computer are secure by default. They don't require protection from firewalls, SIEM logging, or other traditional cybersecurity frameworks because the platform itself is designed to be tamperproof.


It's also the only actual autonomous DAO - the protocol handles all updates so no one is directly in charge.  Proposals have to pass or nothing gets updated.  Any app can be built with this framework through the SNS too.

Alameda alleges Crypto.com has refused to release the funds, which they assert belong to them. This is part of broader efforts to recover assets frozen in other exchanges following FTX's collapse.

There are times when Chinese news outlets have doctored news articles or news reports (on the air or in text format) in general to try to engineer a shift in thinking for ordinary Chinese people. I'll get to this later, but I'm leaning towards saying this was embellished to make people in China think that the government is actually doing their job.               

Link to original Chinese article: https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/QdlzRDmg4IiiWCzv4uYBBQ - Note: we don't see any real photos of a criminal, only ""dramatized"" images.            

Part I find ultra-sus: https://prnt.sc/25spiUbwlLH5                    

The part of this article I am talking about specifically is ""Ê±™ÊüêÊüê.""  The characters ÊüêÊüê can be thought of as ""So-and-so."" The CCP will frequently write the full names of criminals that are sentenced to life or execution (at least in the past they did). I think the only *plausible* reason why they could have redacted his first name is to conceal what access to confidential information he had access to. ""Well then why do we know his surname from the article?"" you may ask. Well, Ê±™ is a really common surname in China.               

The probability of embellished news / signs to look for: I can name an example of a foreign woman helping earthquake refugees in Sichuan China 15 years ago. Before the news segment put the camera on her, they said that she made the claim, ""I am Chinese. these are my people. I'm here to help."" But when the camera cut to this woman, she was not heard saying this. She was only saying, ""I am here to help."" Another televised news segment made mention of a migrant worker who was sitting awkwardly on a bus ride home to not let the dirt he got on himself from his construction job get on other people. Allegedly a woman on the bus yelled at him for being a dirty country-sider, then a 10-year-old boy stood up for the migrant worker and said, ""If him and people like him didn't come here to work, our city wouldn't exist! Don't bully him!"" And the message behind that was ""solidarity"" or ""unity"" among the people of China, regardless of where they are from. Oh, and the camera that was on the bus did not capture this ""scuffle"" at all.",1,2024-11-08 14:56:05,1731099365.0,CryptoCurrency

This move allows for the release of cash to investors as tokens, simplifying the reinvestment process and reducing administrative burdens. Tokenization on Hedera also promises faster settlement times, potentially leading to real-time liquidity and releasing billions of dollars of liquidity into the market. The use of Hedera's 'proof of stake' blockchain is seen as scalable, cost-effective, and environmentally sustainable. Additionally, abrdn has become the largest external shareholder of Archax, the company behind the tokenization process on Hedera.

9985,1gmfcgp,lw3pu2f,"These are good points. TON finality is not instant.

> Am I missing something here

**What is finality?**

* Probabilistic finality: Chance of transaction being final is very high
* Economic finality: Chance of transaction being final is near-100% AND it's almost economically infeasible to revert transactions
* Deterministic finality: Chance of transaction being final is 100% due to protocol

A lot of fast finality is deterministic finality forced by protocol. **It's just hard-coded into protocol that blocks have instant finality without taking into account security and economic  incentives to attack.**

Algorand and Avalanche are set to 1 block because ... that's just what the devs said. They also have really high safety thresholds (needing 85-95% of stake power to attack the network), so they just assume it's not possible to attack. In reality, it is possible to attack, it's just very unlikely. The downside to having a very high safety threshold is that it's really easy to censor them, needing only 5-15% of stake to censor a block.

Cardano and Solana have around 1-3 minute finality.

Bitcoin has probabilistic finality. Reorgs can happen and do happen occasionally, but the chances are low. If there is a determined attacker with $20B of mining equipment gathered over many years, they can reorg the chain fairly easily.

Ethereum has economic finality. It has 12s blocks, but it sets finality at 2 epochs (12-19 minutes) because that's what makes sense from their security design.  Anyone who attacks the network (double-propose or double-attest) will be economically-wiped out.",2,2024-11-08 10:38:33,1731083913.0,CryptoCurrency

I do have a question tho. The TON blockchain is officially released, not in beta like Solana. However, it has faced several a lot of downtime incidents, like  sometimes lasting >6hrs.

This raises the question: what's the purpose of launching another blockchain if it can't reliably handle high demand or onboard a large user base under pressure? While they claim to have a unique, ‚Äúaccidental invention‚Äù in their blockchain (source: TON Mining https://ton.org/en/mining ), the frequent failures, and long downtimes, slower performance, and fees that are higher than Solana and some Layer 2 solutions make it hard to see the competitive advantage.

Like despite being ranking in the top 20 by market cap and having official USDT integration (not bridged), they preform poorely in almost all metrics. I've been a TON user since it was $2 and am active on Telegram, which naturally drew me to their ecosystem. Even during low-usage periods, the transaction speed wasn't particularly impressive. While other major chains like BTC, ETH, and SOL have had their issues with block production, these were typically very brief and rare occurrences - unlike TON's almost persistent problems.
The centralization concerns are also worth noting.

Former President Trump, who once criticized Bitcoin, embraced the crypto industry, contributing to his re-election. The election highlighted crypto's growing political influence, despite it not being a primary voter concern.

BTC and Doge were profitable and Jasmy was not. All three had a success rate of around 50%.

Bitcoin has surged to new all-time highs, showcasing its resilience and appeal during volatile times. Cryptocurrencies offer decentralization, operating independently of central banks, providing a hedge against inflation and political risks. Their blockchain-based systems enable secure, peer-to-peer transactions. The election has spurred interest in these financial alternatives for security, privacy, and long-term investment.

The whale's decision to sell comes amid a 9% rally in ETH prices, which hit a 13-week high. Despite missing the peak prices of previous bull runs, the sale still represents a significant profit. The move coincides with increased ETH exchange inflows, suggesting profit-taking. However, long-term trends show a decrease in ETH held on exchanges, indicating potential bullish sentiment.

This surge is attributed to Trump's perceived pro-business stance and the Democratic Party's negative view on cryptocurrencies. Prominent figures like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Elon Musk, who are associated with Trump, have also influenced this positive sentiment. Despite Trump's past anti-crypto stance, the Republican party's broader support for digital assets has fueled optimism for greater adoption and legitimization of cryptocurrencies.

Since The Merge, when both chains have been upgraded together each one still gets it's own name, then they get melded together when the fork goes to mainnet.

So we had Shanghai for Execution and Capella for the Beacon Chain, and they got blended to 'Shapella'.


Then last March we had Cancun and Deneb, which became 'Dencun'.

And next up will be Prague and Electra, so 'Pectra'.",12,2024-11-07 08:25:19,1730989519.0,CryptoCurrency

The decision follows concerns over the platform's legality under French law, particularly after a French user placed large bets on the U.S. presidential election. Polymarket, known for its prediction markets, has seen significant trading volumes, but the ANJ is assessing its compliance with French gambling laws. The move mirrors similar scrutiny in the U.S. by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

Cdc is terrible especially for US users. I fell victim for their app back in 2021 for the staking gains they had. Locked $4000 in CRO for a year to get that sweet 10%+ usdc gains.   

Almost immediately they started slashing benefits and rates month after month until it sucked. Now all their benefits already suck on top of all their high fees and spread.

That $4000 CRO i bought even staking it for 3 years is only worth $1200 now. I made about $3000 from the staking rewards on usdc before they made it not worth it anymore so i about broke even overall but my initial investment is probably never going to go back to my break even price even with all the staking it's been doing for years.

I believe a lot of people are upgrading though, hopefully they‚Äôre also attracting a lot of new customers, at least to the card.   
I agree not many are probably in profit and those that are , probably keep quiet about it.  But again we all have strategies, sometimes they work, others don‚Äôt, that‚Äôs just life.  You implemented your strategy and it seems it hasn‚Äôt been great in the CDC case, but you‚Äôre blaming the company.

On Nov 5th 2017 the price found a resistance at $7500, retraced to $5866 on Nov 12th, then shoot up past $7500 on its way to $20000.

July 2018 the dead-cat-bounce stopped at around $7500 and then continued falling to the bear market lows.

May to June 2019 the price fluctuated between $7500 to $8000 when recovering after the bear market. Then it shot up past to stop at $13000.

Sept 2019 to may 2020 the price spent the time fluctuating around $7500.

May 14th 2024, Bitcoin stops its climb just shy of $75000.

November 7th 2024 Bitcoin retraces after going over $75000.

Do you see a pattern here? $75X is a psychological barrier. To people numbers over $75 look more like $100 than $50. Many traders buy or sell around those numbers.

11049,1gl8ydz,lvs6au4,"tldr; Bitcoin surged to a new all-time high of $75,350 following Donald Trump's 2024 election win. The market shows strong fundamentals, with Bitcoin derivatives indicating improved sentiment and a lack of excessive leverage, supporting further gains. Despite this, traders remain cautious due to past price resistance at $72,000 and upcoming US Federal Reserve decisions. The potential impact of Trump's policies on institutional adoption and the US fiscal trajectory could influence Bitcoin demand. Overall, Bitcoin derivatives suggest a bullish outlook, though market adjustments may take time.

This significant trading activity occurred amid a Bitcoin price rally to around $74,400. Despite the high trading volume, it doesn't directly translate to net inflows, as only about $600 million of the $4.5 billion first-day volume for Bitcoin ETFs constituted actual inflows. The trading spike coincided with the 2024 US elections, where Donald Trump was projected to win a second term.

So if you trade on a 100$ on a 10:1 lever, you pay 100$ and borrow 900$ for a total of $1000, that is your position. (10x your 100$). 

The liquidation-level for levers is always 100/lever, or in this case 100/10 = 10%

If your 10x lever asset drops by 10%, your $1000 position will only be worth $900, exactly the amount you borrowed. The broker closes your position, takes back the 900$ they lent you and the $100 loss is all yours.

On the opposite case, if the price goes up by 10%, your $1000 position is now worth $1100, you can close the position, return the 900$ and are left with 200$, a 100% gain on your investment.

Once it triggers it places a market order to close your entire position so you may lose more/less than $5 depending on the order book.

If the price moves up and you set your stop loss above your entry then yes, there‚Äôs 0 risk. Do remember to take note of your opening and closing fees though.

If you have no stop loss, a price movement of 100/20 = $5 will liquidate you. Probably less due to fees and margin rate. Margin rate (usually 1.5%) is the % of your initial entry you need in order to maintain your position. In simple terms, you need 1.5% of your $100 = $1.5 for it to not liquidate. 

TL;DR: Say price of BTC is $100. When you are on 20x leverage, when price becomes $101 your unrealised profit is $1x20. Likewise if price becomes $99 your unrealised loss is $1x20. There is no risk if price goes up and you set your loss above your entry.",1,2024-11-06 04:27:56,1730888876.0,CryptoCurrency

11841,1gkiha4,lvlmi4h,"tldr; Bitcoin is currently holding above $70,000, with market focus on a potential breakout. Analyst TradingShot suggests Bitcoin could reach $170,000, based on its historical tendency to rally after rebounding from the 50-week Moving Average (1W MA-50). Bitcoin has recently tested its $73,800 All-Time High (ATH), and a breakout above this level could confirm a bullish trend. The 1.618 Fibonacci extension level, around $170,000, is a significant target. Holding $70,000 is crucial, and a breach could signal a retest of the 1W MA50 support.

Transaction verification will become easier, and Ethereum's transaction history will be optimized for efficiency.

Optimism, even more so Arbitrum, and a few others are taking in transactions and ""roll up"" data to Ethereum making users feel safe. Whether that safety is real, the impact pressure is significant. Even Vitalik uses L2s. 

If less fees have to be paid, then less ether needs to be bought, since fees are always paid in ether.

The flocking created a sudden vacuum, and the price of ether is slowly adjusting as adoption overall continues to grow.

That's assuming OP is asking gain potential.

Ethereum has **more than 95% dominance** of the premier Dapp developer ecosystem. Of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by mcap, 25 are built on top of Ethereum. Only 1 (Raydian ranked at #70) is built on another Layer 1 platform.

25 to 1. That‚Äôs the ratio of dominance. And with strong developer ecosystem network effects, Ethereums lead is insurmountable.

This is the metric that matters. The market likes to see transaction volume and fees generated, and Ethereum is strong there but Solana has been juicing its numbers with trading bots.

People with only a surface level of insight and understanding when it comes to crypto don't know the difference, they think it's still an open race, but if you look at which chain is being chosen to build on by the big companies it's always Ethereum. For smart contracts Ethereum has already won. Take 1 single app, Aave for instance, has more TVL than any other L1. The top 3 L2s together on Ethereum have more TVL than any other L1. Ethereum has more users, activity, volume, developers, development, etc. Almost everything originates on Ethereum. All exciting developments in crypto happen on Ethereum. 

Ethereum has been leading the way in crypto development since its inception. Concepts and designs that were thought to be impossible, the holy grail of crypto, are being invented on Ethereum.

People used to say a decentralized stablecoin was the holy grail of crypto, and this was made possible by Ethereum. People used to talk about the scaling trilemma, this was solved on Ethereum. People said Proof of Stake (real PoS, not *delegated* PoS) was impossible, a pipe dream, and implementing it on Ethereum has akin to performing open heart surgery on a moving train (lol) and guess what, it happened on Ethereum. 

I think there are 3 main reasons price isn't exploding right now. Biggest 1 is that BTC is stealing the limelight right now. 2nd reason is that unlike other L1s like SOL or ADA, Ethereum isn't pumping $100s of millions into marketing to pump the price. 3rd reason is that retail crypto investors are unsophisticated and honestly don't know very much about anything. Like just look at the average person commenting on any thread about anything on this sub. No one knows anything, they are just latching onto and repeating talking points they heard from twitter influencers. But in the end it's not the unsophisticated retail investors who decide what chain will win, it's the big companies moving their infrastructure on-chain, and they are all moving to Ethereum.",12,2024-11-05 23:56:25,1730872585.0,CryptoCurrency

12110,1gk75sb,lvivatl,"tldr; Former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao has filed a motion to dismiss the SEC's amended lawsuit, arguing that the SEC cannot distinguish between crypto securities and Beanie Babies. The motion criticizes the SEC for not providing clear standards for identifying investment contracts in crypto transactions. It also challenges the SEC's request for disgorgement and restrictions on Zhao's market participation, labeling them as meritless. The filing claims the SEC's legal theories are flawed, despite extensive court guidance and discovery.

Their 22nd grants round ends in about 13 hours.

Grand and Bruno exploited a flaw in pre-2015 RoboForm versions, which linked password generation to date and time, to recreate the password.

They consider Donald Trump to be more crypto-friendly compared to Kamala Harris, who may maintain the Democratic Party's strict stance on cryptocurrency. Key factors for Bitcoin's potential growth include U.S. fiscal irresponsibility, high debt levels, and monetary expansion, which increase interest in hard assets. The success of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs is also expected to boost demand.

2. ATL (Column B): Shows the all-time low value reached during each period.


3. Date of ATL (Column C): Specifies the date when the ATL was reached for each period.


4. ATH (Column D): Indicates the all-time high value reached during each period.


5. Date of ATH (Column E): Provides the date when the ATH was achieved.


6. Percentage Growth (Cycle ATL-ATH) (Column F): Calculates the growth percentage from ATL to ATH within each cycle using the formula:



\text{Percentage Growth} = \frac{\text{ATH} - \text{ATL}}{\text{ATL}} \times 100

8. Percentage Growth (Prev ATH - Pres ATH) (Column H): Measures the percentage growth from the ATH of one period to the ATH of the next period, based on the formula:

This projection is based on historical trends where Bitcoin's price often sees a 40% increase after nearing its all-time high. The 'Bitcoin black hole effect' suggests Bitcoin's dominance grows with each cycle, drawing value from altcoins. Institutional interest, such as BlackRock's investments, supports this bullish outlook. Additionally, changes in accounting rules could encourage more companies to hold Bitcoin, further driving its price upward.

The breach led to a temporary suspension of withdrawals, but MetaWin's swift response restored 95% of user withdrawals, minimizing the impact. The stolen funds were traced to exchanges KuCoin and HitBTC. MetaWin has since enhanced its security measures and is working to recover the remaining funds, emphasizing the importance of robust cybersecurity in the online gambling sector.

Despite challenges from competitors, it dominates decentralized exchanges and real-world asset markets. Investors remain cautious, but the outlook may change as Ethereum's potential becomes clearer.

This spending, primarily directed towards a non-partisan super PAC focused on supporting pro-crypto candidates and opposing skeptics, represents nearly half of all corporate contributions this election cycle. This unprecedented financial involvement by the crypto sector aims to make crypto regulation a key issue for candidates, with the majority of funds coming from companies like Coinbase and Ripple. This surge in spending follows the Citizens United ruling, which allows unlimited corporate contributions to super PACs, and positions crypto corporations as major political spenders, second only to fossil fuel corporations in total election-related spending.

The data suggests Bitcoin is maturing as an asset, with increased stability and institutional buy-in, potentially positioning it as a modern safe-haven asset amidst inflationary concerns.

This includes compliance requirements for transparency and risk management, aligning with global standards. The regulations, effective from March 2024 with a phased compliance until August 2025, require VASPs to report transactions over $1,350. These measures aim to boost the economy but may increase compliance costs and drive users to peer-to-peer transactions.

This growth was driven by a surge in Bitcoin's value and a 67% increase in average daily transaction volume, which hit 6 trillion won. The market's total valuation rose by 27% to 55.3 trillion won. Male investors, particularly in their 30s, dominate the market. Most investors hold modest amounts, with 67% having less than 500,000 won in crypto assets. Bitcoin remains the most popular asset.

Exchanges will many times double count volume. So when I buy $1 of ETH and you sell $1 of ETH instead of counting that as $1 of volume, which is how a traditional exchange would do it, they count it as $2.

Polymarket has figured out an even better way to fudge the volume numbers:

If someone buys the Hillary Clinton to win the presidential election for $0.01, Polymarket counts that as $1 of volume because the nominal value of the contract at expiration if she wins is $1

So not just double counting volume 100x the actual underlying cash changing hands.

Many ransom attackers actually offer a Monero discount. Lets say someone asks you for 10k USD worth of Bitcoin in ransom. It is not uncommon that they at the same time will also offer you to pay your ransom in Monero at a 10% discount, lowering your ransom to 9k USD. 

As long, as they have good OPSEC, it is impossible to catch them. But the cases of those being caught, are the ones, where the criminal didnt have good OPSEC. Just as bad OPSEC as their victim had, which led them to becoming a victim in the first place.

So far not a single Monero transaction has ever been deanonymized. Criminals using Monero have been caught in the past, because they accidentally uploaded private documents of their victims (because they didnt pay the ransom) alongside their entire home folder. Thats how the Vastaamo guy got caught for example. Others just talk way too much. Most criminals actually just talk way too much. Thats why we dont need everything to be transparent.

In the end, criminals will just catch themselves, due to their bad OPSEC outside the Monero network. Its very hard to fuck up inside the Monero network, but incredibly easy to fuck up outside of it.",1,2024-11-04 15:50:59,1730757059.0,CryptoCurrency

Please note that promoting tax evasion violates Rule 4.  This is [a site wide rule](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) and [a subreddit rule](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/about/rules/).  Do not endorse, suggest, advocate, instruct others, or ask for help with tax evasion.  Do not be coy and sarcastically recommend against it or suggest using a privacy coin in response to an IRS inquiry.

Note:  Tax discussion is allowed as long as the above rules are not violated.

This move reflects growing investor interest in tokenized financial assets. UBS's initiative is seen as integrating Ethereum into traditional finance, potentially boosting Ether's value. The fund offers institutional-grade cash management solutions and follows a conservative, risk-managed framework. This launch follows a successful pilot and aligns with similar moves by other financial institutions towards tokenized assets.

Volatility works both ways. I can also buy Bitcoin at $65K too, and buy something with it worth now $70K. And I've now outpaced inflation annually in the span of just a week.

This is not something new, nor unique to crypto.

Any currency, any financial instruments, will always have some volatility and not be perfectly synched with other instruments.

If you go to the UK and convert your dollars to pounds, you're also gonna have some weeks when your $20K is gonna buy you ¬£16K, and the following week it's only gonna buy you ¬£14K. So you lost $2k in purchasing power in a matter of a week.

That's something that happens when converting to any currencies.

At least, with Bitcoin, it's trending up over time, so in the long run you're gonna be ahead. It's hard to say the same for any traditional currencies.",1,2024-11-02 09:46:18,1730558778.0,CryptoCurrency

For others using Blockchain is now the only way to make things happen and move into the right direction and the big adoption is already happening. 

It will not happen from the richest countries and trickle down to the poor cause in the rich countries people use Blockchain mostly to gamble and try and find assets that will make them more money. The mindset is totally different and none of this technology is actually important since most of people have it ok. It's not supposed to be a tech that will just be set up to make you more rich by just sitting on a ""coin"". It's a delusion and the ponzinomics of the whole space just enforce that image. 

What it is, is a tech that removes a lot of friction in sending, receiving funds and keeping data secure and always accessible AND if ideal situations make it happen, yes it will have assets that are better.hedged against inflation. 

For places like India, Argentina, Brazil, Afganistan prople already use the chain to change their lives, to get access to services and privileges that they never had before and the change is happening swiftly and in next few years it will take over.

Experts argue that Bitcoin acts as a hedge against currency debasement and that banning it would be challenging and potentially ineffective in preserving government spending flexibility.

Currently, ETH trades at $2,516, with analysts predicting a potential retest of $2,800.

The tax authority has been quite literally scamming citizens when it comes to crypto for years.

Crypto is also asymmetrically taxed, meaning you get around 20% back if you lose, but pay up to 53% if you win. This is *per trade*.

This has led to court cases (that the citizen lost) where people who had trading bots like the binance bots etc, and did hundreds, thousands or even hundreds of thousands of tiny trades. These people received a bill for millions of Danish crowns, as even if the majority of trades were profitable, the asymmetry of the tax meant you lost no matter what unless you had like a 100% hit rate which no one has.

When they tried to refute it they were told to bugger off and pay. Let me be clear, these were ordinary tax paying citizens who lost their houses and quite frankly lives over this theft.

The group, posing as police, used fraudulent legal threats to demand 10 million USDT. Mr. Sai transferred 5.6 million baht in digital currency under duress. The case, involving 12 perpetrators, has shaken the credibility of the Thai police force. Two suspects, acting as interpreters, remain at large. The case is under the National Anti-Corruption Commission's jurisdiction.

Investigations by Chaos Labs and Inca Digital suggest that a significant portion of Polymarket's $2.7 billion trading volume on election bets may be due to wash trading, which artificially inflates activity. This raises concerns about the platform's influence on public opinion and election outcomes, especially as Polymarket's odds show a 67% chance of victory for Donald Trump, contrary to tighter race predictions from other polls.

The current momentum is fueled by institutional interest and potential political impacts, with Bitcoin ETFs seeing significant inflows. Analysts suggest a bullish phase if Bitcoin remains above $70,000, though caution is advised due to overbought conditions.

15067,1ggg6vh,lupeqsp,"tldr; A legal analysis by the Italian firm Coinlex has revealed a flaw in Italy's taxation of cryptocurrency capital gains, indicating that the effective tax rate should be 12.5% instead of the 26% previously applied. This discovery could lead to potential refunds for thousands of taxpayers who overpaid taxes in 2023 and 2024. The finding is based on a detailed examination of regulations, particularly Article 5, Section 2 of Legislative Decree 66/2014, which suggests crypto-assets should be taxed at 12.5%. Taxpayers are advised to seek refunds for the overpaid amount.

Over 82,000 ANT tokens were sold through AragonDAO‚Äôs redemption process, netting approximately $1.07 million in ETH. This move is part of efforts to liquidate seized crypto assets, coinciding with AragonDAO's winding-down process. The liquidation is part of the broader fallout from the collapse of Alameda and FTX.

15307,1gg7fes,luoa594,"You are onto something, the dynamics of this cycle are very different from what we saw in previous ones. Look at the U.S. data: personal credit card debt is at an all time high, more than half the country living paycheck to paycheck, personal savings rate is at a 10+ year low. People still feel the effects of inflation in their pocket and don't have spare money. This is why retail is mostly staying away this time, no headlines despite BTC at ATH, etc. Nobody still believes that crypto will revolutionize entire industries anymore. There's very few new usecases on the horizon that would get people excited, at this point it's basically just Bitcoin aka ""digital gold"" and then some meme coin gambling for the degenerates that think they are smarter than the rest of us and can get rich quick.

The only money coming into crypto is big money, e.g. Saylor, Blackrock, ETFs. Unlike retail, these guys still have deep pockets. Also keep in mind that a lot less money was needed to push BTC from 20k to 69k than to push it from 690k or whereever you think we will be going. A lot more money is needed and I don't see where it should be coming from. Inflation is sticky, they can maybe cut the rates a little but there won't be QE stimulus as we saw in the past. I think we have been pampered in the last 10 years with easy money (not just crypto, also look at the S&P500 chart). This will not simply continue forever. 

My 2c is that the rest of this cycle won't be near as glorious as many here hope. Sure, BTC will make new ATHs (not so sure about most other alts) but this cycle could be over much earlier (and lower) than most anticipate.

There is a reason people are pivoting to memes over utility. They want to avoid the sell-pressure to feed this bloated industry, avoid areas where there is a lot of structural selling. Crypto is weird. In traditional tech business, when a company sees a downturn in user growth and fees, they stop hiring, expanding, and cutting fat. In crypto, they just fund more extravagant parties in Dubai, hire BDs doing who knows what, etc.

The space's liquidity is tight. The rising tide to pay for all these extravagant expenses can't be sustained.

Good question, let's look at some data:


**Smart Contracts:** 

Electric Capital does a deep analysis each year of all development in crypto. For their last report they looked at 485 million code commits across 818k open-source repositories.

When they filtered out all the non-code stuff like edits to readme files etc and code that is just copy-pasted from other places, they found that about 71% of all new/novel code is first found on one particular ecosystem, Ethereum:

https://www.developerreport.com/developer-report?s=71-of-contract-code-is


**DeFi:** 


Ethereum's DeFi ecosystem is literally bigger than that of every other chain combined: 

https://defillama.com/chains

And that's even counting Ethereum L2s as different chains... 3 of the top 10 chains by DeFi value are Ethereum L2s.



**RWA projects:** 

In total about $13.3 billion worth of traditional financial assets have been brought onchain, about $12.4 billion of that is on Ethereum:

https://www.rwa.xyz/


Blackrock's trial treasury fund on Ethereum has grown from $100m to over $500m in about 7 months. They have stated their intention to ultimately tokenize every stock and bond, and said that will happen on Ethereum. 

https://etherscan.io/token/0x7712c34205737192402172409a8f7ccef8aa2aec


Visa are launching a RWA platform to allow financial assets to be moved onto Ethereum:

 https://investor.visa.com/news/news-details/2024/Visa-Introduces-the-Visa-Tokenized-Asset-Platform/default.aspx


WisdomTree (an asset management company with over $110 billion AUM) have launched one too: 


https://ir.wisdomtree.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/704/wisdomtree-launches-new-platform---wisdomtree-connect


So yea, it's pretty clear where everything meaningful is being built. Certain other chains are much better at manipulating narratives and facilitating rugcoins though, so I guess Ethereum doesn't win at everything.",12,2024-10-31 03:17:47,1730362667.0,CryptoCurrency

For examples of reporting on Solana's manipulated figures here are some articles describing it:

* https://dailycoin.com/solana-stablecoin-volumes-artificially-inflated/


* https://protos.com/did-jump-crypto-cause-solana-stablecoin-volume-to-collapse/



And as for how this is done, just look at how many products there are selling fake volume bots to rugcoin deployers:

The poll also indicated that 30% of respondents trust the Republican Party more on crypto policy, while 42% trust neither party.

The Bitcoin futures premium is at a four-month high, indicating bullish investor conviction. Although Bitcoin's price closely followed gold, recent US economic data suggests reduced demand for alternative assets. Despite a short-term price pullback, market resilience and trader confidence in Bitcoin's bullish momentum remain strong.

At the Hong Kong Fintech Week 2024, Nazarov discussed Chainlink's development of a system to connect SWIFT with blockchain technology, potentially leading to significant adoption by banks and institutions. This integration could expand the blockchain market from a few trillion to tens or even hundreds of trillions of dollars.

Kraken continues to expand, launching a new Ethereum layer-2 blockchain, Ink.

Assumed Diluted Shares Outstanding is not calculated using the treasury method and does not take into account any vesting conditions (in the case of equity awards), the exercise price of any stock option awards or any contractual conditions limiting convertibility of convertible debt instruments.",3,2024-10-30 17:16:12,1730326572.0,CryptoCurrency
