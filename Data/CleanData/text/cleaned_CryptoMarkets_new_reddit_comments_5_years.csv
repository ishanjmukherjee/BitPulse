In short, XRP is tailored towards bank institutions and offers liquidity and settlement cases for foreign funds. Stable coins can not do this nearly as effectively. 

Where stable coins exist outside of traditional financial institutions, XRP is working to integrate directly with them. This makes worldwide transactions faster and cheaper than ever before.

Hi there
Get uniswap wallet
To start investing in crypto and staking you'll need a decentralized wallet like metamask trust wallet ledger exodus Coinbase trezor and all other as you're familiar with it 
There are so many wallets to mention a few  but the first rule of crypto don't keep your money in exchanges as they can get bankrupt and close down (Not your keys Not your coins) 
You can get a decentralized wallet on the Appstore or playstore 
I'd recommend uniswap wallet
It supports ERC20 tokens
After getting your wallet
You'll need to connect to decentralized applications (dapps) on the defi portal

XRP's full fib extension would put it at $4 per. That's a 3.8x from its current price. Might as well stick with ETH.

375,2024-11-17,"Welcome to the crazy world of crypto! 

Some advice: 
When you first buy a token it’s common to constantly keeps checking the charts. Avoid this as it will drive you nuts and consume most of your time. 

I made some decent money investing in projects in their infancy, it’s a bit hit and miss though but you’ll soon get a better idea of  who the crooks and who are winners are. I’d advise learning how blockchain transactions and wallets work as you’ll soon be able to sniff out suspicious activity which will help you decide whether to invest or not. Once you have an idea of this then you’ll be able to go to etherscan for example and see what projects are doing with their funds. 

Join telegram that’s where most projects have the best activity. Reddit and twitter also good but TG and discord is faster. 

Get a metamask wallet. And secure your seedwords! 

Buy a trezor hardware wallet, Scammers everywhere! If you get a DM or email it’ll likely be a scam. Anyone asks you for your seed words tell them to piss off and block. 

I’d advise start of buying some ethereum, just maybe a few hundred bucks to starts you off. 

There a shit tonn of meme coins out there and most of them either get rugged or just flop. You’ll get the odd meme that will  do well but it’s very much a lottery. Maybe get a few just for your portfolio but I wouldnt go crazy. 

Take your time to research tokens and you’ll find joining a crypto community group can be helpful, again,  just take care with these. 

Now, if I was new and wanted some personal advice on what token/project to research then I’d advise Honor Vs Madness. It’s a new crypto game launching on ETH. It’s going to be live in around 9 months so you’ve time to get in early. 
(And NO, this ain’t a shill. I’m genuinely giving the OP a good chance of getting into a decent project that I’ve researched, that’s not going to rug early) 
Of course don’t take my word do you research on the project and decide for yourself. 

Good luck on your crypto quest and I hope it’s prosperous for you. Best thing I ever did!

The reason people don’t like that answer is bc they quickly realize bitcoin is only gonna 2.5x their money in the next 12months, and people think they deserve more than that—They want some boner coin to 2000x.

But in 99.99% of cases, your boner coin is going to zero. And even if it does 2000x before it does, you’re gonna miss the gains bc you’re a new investor, you’re suceptible to greed, and you don’t know which indicators to rely on.

466,2024-11-16,"So.. The problem isn't investing the small amount, 
It's that your return on investment is too small to matter at the start. 

I disagree. Investing your small bag means you put it away and forget it for years. Will the ROI be small? Sure in the beginning, but those small amounts grow. 

An ROI on education depends on whether you get a job in your field of study. If you excel well in that job and move up and grow your earnings. 

An ROI on a small business depends on the success of the business- which may a risky investment. 

An ROI on a skill is dependent on how much supply and demand there are for that skill, and whether you are capable of mastering said skill. 

An ROI in an investment portfolio is dependent on the market, but requires no excess effort to begin. Set aside some money from what you earn, put it into an account, and forget it. Let it grow. 


All forms of investments have pros and cons, it matters  in how you want to live, and what you want to do, or invest in. 

Split your investments into what you want to accomplish in life.

SWIFT Time To Finish: 1-5 business days.    
SWIFT Low End and Unlikely Cost: 500,000 EU  
SWIFT Likely Cost: 1,000,00 to 3,000,000  
SWIFT High Cost: 3,000,000-5,000,000

The cost range uncertainty is due to it depends on how many intermediary banks are involved which is an unknown and multiple currency exchanges can occur and banks often apply an exchange rate mark up.  This is on top of typical sending fees.  The time range is large because banks typically won't process SWIFT outside of business hours and if you get multiple banks involved in different time zones it can make it take longer.

Now let's look at XRP.

XRP Time to Finish: 3-5 seconds.

XRP Cost: 0.00001 XRP.

It's that simple.  Even if XRP was 1,000 a token, which is HIGHLY unlikely to happen, that means the transfer costs 1 cent.  Now, banks can apply their own fees to this but it would still limit the number of banks involved which would vastly cut down on the cost to the end user.  For example. if both parties charge a .5% fee, which is not uncommon, we are looking at a 100,000 fee in total.

Ugh, this is getting too long so here are some more bullet points:

* It's use case can go past these bank transfers.  For example, credit card payouts, paycheck payouts, etc.  It's all about the fast sending of money with minimal fees.  It would make even getting a daily paycheck the moment you clock out of work possible.  
* Ripple, who made XRP, has their ledger system which can use a lot of different coins, is still powered by XRP under the hood, albeit at a very reduced rate.
* XRP has a large company working on growing it.  For decentralization this is bad but for adoption it is good.
* The US SEC has completely hamstrung XRP since 2020 but the US is moving to more crypto friendly which is already paying off for XRP.
* Ripple already has multiple partnerships.
* The next admin(I am trying to avoid the name to remove any political chatter), has said they wanted to remove taxes on digital currencies for companies in the US. 

  
So, all this was enough for me to put my hat into XRP a few months ago.  It's pumping now but, like with BTC, I think the current price is laughable to what we will see in a few years.  And, of course, I have that typical investor feeling of ""I wish I had put more into it.' :)",positive,0.8684458,48

816,2024-11-15,"Some great aspects of Qan: 

15M investment from VC of a member of Qatari Royal family — H.E. Sheikh Mansoor Bin Khalifa Al-Thani — that:

“{Sheikh Mansoor Bin Khalifa Al-Thani} previously led the IT Department for the Supreme Council of Family Affairs for the ruling family”

(https://forbesmiddleeastevents.com/Speakers/h-e-sheikh-mansoor-bin-khalifa-al-thani/)

Below are some quotes from an interview conducted 7 months ago on the future prospect of the Qatari economy, MBK’s investment philosophy, and his own personal understanding of what global development for humanity means:

“MBK is different because it is a serial entrepreneur journey that I went through that {has led me to} really respect entrepreneurs, and I see entrepreneurs are the game changer, the value creator. They are our hope for a better planet that we are living in. {Thus}, MBK holding is a little bit more than angel investing or VC or incubator or accelerator: It’s a complete ecosystem.”

“You don’t need to see what — see who. Who you are is everything; where you are is irrelevant. This is one of the foundations of the quality talent economy — to attract brains based on their quality of heart before the brain. We need to acknowledge we are human and make everything around us to serve humanity. It is not just about achieving a goal; no, we need to validate that! So the talent economy is where I think we should see the economy go for a better, more sustainable future.

This is a quote from his Highness the Amir and his excellency the prime minister, they really want to create a very sustainable economy. I think the most sustainable element of an economy is us: We are the main element of an economy. Everything can go up and down, but we remain the same, so quality talent economy {functions} by attracting quality talent to foster your own ecosystem.”

“I have a personal mission statement that summarizes the global ecosystem and future economy. I made it oversimplified; I just made it in two words, two pillars: Trust & Fairness. Trust to start and fairness to last. If you can master these two in a community and attract people so they can really trust you and you are really fair to last, you will win.” 

(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzVqBr_0gZc)

If you have not already watched this video, I would highly recommend taking the 20 minutes when free to know just how incredible our lead investor & his holding co. are. This is the type of person you want on your team; not only does MBK offer:

“{A} focus extend[ing] to various regional markets, including Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Turkey, and United Kingdom while also encompassing other global opportunities. MBK Holding recently signed a strategic partnership with the Ministry of Investment of Saudi Arabia to support entrepreneurial growth and innovation in Saudi Arabia by developing growth services that seek to create market-leading investment opportunities.”

We also have someone genuinely invested in the team, who has searched for people that stand-out in the talent economy and has landed on our team of exceptional individuals. He has put his trust in the team & will remain fair in his support. Likewise, we have all put our trust in the team, and now it is time to continue to be fair, to not force answers out of uproar when we know the team is doing everything in their power at present.

Since they had no VC's, no Influencers, no LP dump, all organic growth, and survived now for almost a year, I think they will make a huge pump in this bull market. I'm confident on saying this because the protocoll has 52% of the tokens locked in escrow wallets, current mcap is around 13m$ FDV, they have good tokenomics and the community is extremely vivid.

No need for exchanges because you self custody (hold your own private keys) and you can buy literally anything via decentralized exchanges (DEXes) which usually rely on “liquidity pools” instead of order books. So no need to place orders and wait for them to hit you just buy or sell into the pool and the LP price adjusts programmatically.

A word of caution though- self custody also means self security. You need to keep your private key and recovery phrase safe. That’s how you prove control of a key pair. You also need to be aware that there are hundreds of creative ways to be scammed. And if you are responsible for your own security of your own wallet nobody else is there to bail you out when you get phished or connect to a “wallet drainer” site.

When people on X are crying that it's at all time lows and is worthless and needs to be sold, that's when it's a good time to buy. But it goes against human instinct (fear of losing money).

People always do the opposite of what makes sense and this is why. You want to buy low and sell high, not buy high and sell low.

I don't know what will happen. Bitcoin is set to pump for a year until mid-late 2025. Alt and meme coins follow it's trajectory so they will go up.

1471,2024-11-15,"Buddy, idk who's telling you we are jumping to 100million+ ""next year"", but maybe you should find room for some more conservative voices in your opinion roster.


But if you actually believe we are going to 100mil.. why even ask this question? Buy now! Buy whenever! 100million?? Isn't that over 1000x? Who cares what the price is right now if you think a prediction like that has any merit to it lol.


The reality is, markets, including BTC/crypto as a whole, do not need a reason to grind higher, or even to pump really.  They just head upwards through sheer virtue of the price having gone higher previously, which sparks greater interest, which leads to more investors, which drives the price higher.. there can be narratives that drive it up faster, such as Trump's election, but generally no news is good news, and crypto would likely be grinding higher even if Kamala had won, though perhaps slower or at a later date.


Markets do however require a reason to go DOWN, every major pullback has an underlying reason, rational or not.  Even the smaller pullbacks have reasons behind them but those events are so brief and so inconsequential/technical for the average retail trader that we never hear about them.  So the question is, is there anything on the horizon that could reverse this trend of BTC seemingly melting upwards? In my opinion the answer is no, for now (as long as you stick your fingers in your ears and go ""lalala"" every time sometimes mentions a recession and the yield curve).


Eventually there will be some sort of pullback, who knows the reason why or when, but if you have faith in BTC, and you must if you are willing to put money on it, I assume you also have faith that it will resume course and head higher after a pullback. In which case, why agonize over trying to time a pullback that might never arrive?  And if it does arrive, should simply undo itself over time? 


For someone like you who is trapped between the anxiety that it might go lower, or that it might go higher, and so is paralyzed trying to make the ""best"" decision (which is impossible) just start DCA-ing into BTC starting now.  Because BTC is going to pick a direction regardless of whatever you predict, and you're never going to find an argument that fully assuages that choice anxiety. Plus, I think it's fair to say most people consider where we are an ""accumulation stage"".


Altcoins are trickier to navigate, or at least have been for the last few years, and are much riskier.  In my opinion you should at least be having a look into altcoins, cautiously and with GREAT SKEPTICISM, with both a potential 2025 altcoin season in mind, as well as the possibility of NO 2025 altseason in mind.  


I also don't believe BTC will be revisiting those levels you mentioned, but if it does (and it could, anything can happen), something has gone very wrong if it goes below 70k.. and I can almost guarantee that the FUD surrounding a pullback like that will render you too scared of it dropping even further for you to buy at those levels either. But again, if there's no convincing narrative beyond ""what ifs"" to send BTC down to those levels, why entertain it as anything more than one possibility of many? Momentum is a better bet than a hypothetical.  


Also, if BTC did drop to sub 70k, altcoins would get CRUSHED, which might give you your answer as to whether you should head into altcoins right now.  If you believe a 70k BTC is on the table, you should also believe altcoins are still too  risky an investment.


I also believe that, judging by the amount of money the crypto industry spent this year lobbying (bribing) both the Republicans and the Democrats, that crypto policies and regulations might end up essentially being written by the crypto industry, for better or worse, and passed via Trump acting as a proxy.  I.e, the U.S government could provide some serious headwind for crypto for the foreseeable future.. or until they decide it isn't making them and their buddies enough money, or decide it's getting in the way of business as usual.  Who knows.  


There's no purely right answers because you'll be dogged with the feeling that you could have done something better no matter what you choose to do.  And no one has a clue what's going to happen in this market at any given moment, no matter how much we pretend.  You're essentially trying to time the market, and even the best investors will tell you, just don't bother, it's too hard.",positive,0.7882316,2

If the whales pull the price deflates and hits a new floor somewhere between the pre-election numbers and the current numbers.

Now, they managed to secure listings quickly, which means those guys had contacts  and capital, Market volume is around 5 billion (which is also bonkers).    They have 54k holders, and a market cap of $1.5B.  So overall - kind of crazy as its been around for only 12 days.   So they did get listings and volumes so fast, so I'm guessing the guys behind it has a bunch of other coins and good marketing brunt along with contacts.     To get to that volume, they must just had a network of people already ready, or if those posts of their went viral on social media.    For any token to go viral, you must have an excellent messaging strategy and a viral message - one that gets propagated. So while peanuts story was tragic it does seem quite crazy.   

ACT - don't know which one you refer to, if you can send the link, or full name so i can see which one of the dozens ACT tokens you are referring to. 

I'm myself gettig involved with a token that have the following properties:

1. Have a functional app, and its a poker based one. Social poker, i.e. free.  
2. Have large cash prizes (still free entries).   
3.  Have a token mechanic that allows for residual revenues via a form of royatlties.  
4.  Good fundamentals (i.e. business plan and concept) that makes it unique.   
5. And guys that seems to know very well what they are doing, i.e experienced. 

So I'm not quite into meme-coins and i think that something like PNUT will implode pretty quickly, its clearly a quick cash grab.   So, can give someone a quick cash thing if they come in at the right time. Sooner or later the price will crash and will likely dunk down huge percentages each day when it does. So if you put money into those meme coins, be prepared for a rocky ride and realize its in the highest of likelihood as a very short time boost.",positive,0.8835789,2

1932,2024-11-13,"Personally I‘d rate this 3/10.

Link is a lagger… sure it has its reputation and use case, but there’s just much better performing stuff. It’s basically a mid-curve coin.

Theta is an old coin that I don’t think has much hype, or am I mistaken? No hype is a red flag, because hype is literally what we‘re trading.

Solana is an obvious good pick but weighted way too lightly especially in comparison to Link.

Pepe is alright I guess… getting that Meme exposure. Keeping this at 10% or less should keep you sane :)

Seeing as BTC dominance has been ripping up to 60% and beyond I‘m very happy to have always had 50% of my portfolio in the good old King. So yes, as you predicted, that is my recommendation. However it might be too late at this point. BTC.D is probably very close to topping, so maybe it‘s not worth bothering now haha.
ETH on the other hand I actually sold off for more BTC and SOL because it was heavily underperforming. But the ETH/BTC chart might be reversing by now so maybe you‘ll want to add some ETHunsure

Anyway I‘d highly recommend throwing out Link and Theta and maybe diversify just a bit more. I felt this yesterday as my PAAL bag nuked 65%. I‘m happy it’s just one of the couple of Ai coins I hold. If all my Ai exposure would have been in PAAL I‘d be screwed now.
Also consider not mid-curving and buying the hyped narratives (like you did with Pepe). So get some Ai exposure and maybe some RWA (ONDO and/or OM mainly I guess)",positive,0.8132925,1

1943,2024-11-13,"Depends on what your time perspective is, I would sincerely not hold meme-coins, like Pepe. Theta - believe they missed the boat. Solana, can work out ok, but they have some possible legal issues, but likely can dance around them.   Chainlink:  can do ok.      To diversify your portfolio a bit, I would look on straight utility coins, not just infrastructure coins or meme's, like PEPE.   I favor app related coins, with utility and other proprties, such as ones for games and gamified trading and similar.  Why?  They have their own revenue streams and following so they will stable(r) in a down turn.  If they take of and get traction, they can get 100X boost quickly. That said, i wouldn't allocate to much into that part: but say 20%-25%.    The point is to get in while times are good and then sit out when the dip comes - and of course, get a big multiple on the smaller coins. Bitcoin etc will not give you 100X, but can it give you 10-25-50-100%?  yeah.  It's also more 'stable' as compared to the other smaller coins. Its a higher risk with smaller coins, but a bigger potential upside. Game tokens, if you research well, represent a good upside with a not extraordinary risk.",positive,0.8538398,0

I would advise against investing into meme-coins, as they have for simple reasons no tangible value, makinging them risky and volatile. Look for coins that hae very high degree of utility:   i.e. their holders can use them for something and find them valuable for that reason.   It can be good to look at newer coins, as that will help you to get a very good price, but diversify your portfolio, spread out the risks. I myself like game and gamified coins as I belieev that is a huge use-case for crypto.  I target smaller game tokens that come from people with experience, ie not 20 year old kids with no past experience in launching complex apps.  I often look for them in the launch staages and then plunk down so i get the deepest discounts. Since those that make it have a huge upside, 50-100x, it does add up.

2088,2024-11-12,"Here’s my take into this topic:

1) The fact and speculation that BTC might be used as a store of value, it will take time to get there but it has made a huge advancement in many ways, like countries buying, big companies like blackrock having ETF’s, and ppl say even banks may already have some or will have in the future.

2) It uses blockchain technology, it may be an overrated argument when talking about cryptocurrencies, but having blockchain tech being used for digital assets that enable us to do transactions is massive + it’s descentralized.

remember blockchain may have more use cases, for example in healthcare systems: imagine you are heavily allergic to morphine and have a terrible accident, you’re alone in another place, unconscious and there’s nobody to help the professionals in the establishment know about your condition, you could die because of this, but with blockchain the ppl working may have your data safely secured with all the files and conditions you have had in other places, hence making their job easier and safer.

Having this type of tech in digital currencies, combined with DeFi and being descentralized is amazing.

3) I think people underestimate this one, “Smart contracts”, they can be soo useful for almost any b2b scenario, from logistics to legal issues, it makes transactions lack less transparency and more efficient, while helping both ends meet their need evenly.

Edit (extra one)

4) In a podcast about crypto I was hearing last month, a guy was comparing the meme coins space to a casino, a DeFi casino, where every meme is a different game to gamble, then he talked about how almost everyone holding big serious cryptos also had their meme bag which would correlate to a certain degree with the potential and exponential growth the meme space could achieve, sometime after he stated the massive inflow betting sites have had and that this could also happen with memes.",positive,0.8871771,2
2089,2024-11-12,"If there was a single good use that wasn't just tacked on bs, it would be the top crypto instantly, surpassing Bitcoin nearly immediately. There isn't one and probably will never be one since you can do literally anything better _without_ something as heavy as blockchain. It's a glorified points system. Just like our fiat system. We assign it value and it has value because it trades for that much.

Turns out, people love cash value and points and give them value and try to collect and trade them. That's it. Turns out, our fiat money based system is exactly the same way, minus slightly less traceable if you use paper/cash. Will a completely digital currency replace our own? Eventually. I rarely touch paper money as it. It's like books or vinyls, people will still use fiat because they like to. Does crypto have a use case for other than being a public tracking of data? No. Just like how digital money doesn't have another use.",positive,0.92185515,3

2209,2024-11-13,"All markets? Or specific? 
We'd need to know their purpose.
But the root of each one is the ability to move money into them. 

Let's say crypto. 
Overall, most ppl use crypto to defer the USD. If the Usd is losing its value and ppl want a profitable safeguard,  they'll stop holding onto something worthless and invest in so.ething with value growth potential as recently proven.

Precious metals: 
Again ,same aspect, same thinking.
But to this, countries are also buying Precious metals and storing them as well so the metals being invested in are becoming less abundant . Makes them more scarce and rives up the price because there is more demand but the available supply is shrinking. 

How about financial assets (country dollars)
Banks are dropping interest rates near the end of the year as they always do. This means that banks are more comfortable giving out loans. I'm not talking about the loan that u and I get for a few $k or 10/20k. I'm talking about millions.
Companies do t like to hold overhead loans in their books through the end of year Into a new fiscal quarter, so they'll borrow when it's cheap to do so and pay it back quickly. Banks are happy with that.

This means MONEY is no longer illiquid. 

Want to see it in real time. Look at the car dealer on your block. a car has been sitting there for months.

What's the interest rate offer 5 months ago vs. now? And what's the sale price 5 months ago vs. now? And what incentives do they offer now vs 5 mo ths ago?

I say 5 months because that was a carryover between 2 prior fiscal quarters.

Institutions and large finances have their taxes paid in year quarters. This keeps money moving throughout the financial sector more evenly. 

Presidents dont pay off a countries bills. WE DO.
The reason oil / gas prices are up have very little to do with a president, if at all.

A CPI announcement in the FED meetings at 10am in New York on a Tuesday is not what makes the market rise or fall. These prices were determined to move from point a to point b several months in advance.

My plan for altcoins was to buy the market low which i had placed around 16k for BTC at the time(close enough…i always start re-accumulating when btc is down 75%-80% fom previous ATH) , accumulate promising coins, then switch into the ones that were outperforming btc in the lead up to the halving and ditch the ones that weren’t. I will hold until BTC looks toppy (monthly rsi around 90’s, coinbase #1 on app store, pi cycle top fires, or we approach 2026 without having crashed yet)


  i like coins with a credible professional team that put out results, viable tech with a realistic demand, and a psych factor that would suggest normies will pile in when they hit the market. Balls deep in the AI sector (I like FET, AITECH, LKI, CGPT for this cycle) a bag of INJ and some TOKEN for RWA factor

Also, someone mentioned that the transaction fee increases as well. This is where layer 2 technology would come in. Where transactions would occur off-chain, then settle periodically on the main blockchain. Which would lower congestion and keep the fees manageable. 

That's just the two things I can think of off the top of my head at the moment. Hopefully, it gives a different perspective to  your question

Edit: As far as the price goes, there will still be demand, especially with growing adoptions, and by that time, it could potentially be integrated so deeply in society that it would be impossible to shift away from it. Also, scarcity is always a factor that will continue to increase prices. 

So, in conclusion, miners will still play a significant role but their influence on the price will shift as they focus more on capitalizing from transaction fees. The price will mainly be driven by scarcity, demand, and adoption beyond that point.

There's a name for the effect that's escaping me, but like as we became able to more efficiently use oil, we unintuitively started to use way more oil instead of less because we could now scale and do more with it. Similar with layer 2s / 3s allowing us to interact with the base layer more efficiently and scale to more people, we could sustain far greater demand on the settlement layer.

There are already layer 2 solutions, like the Lightning Network, that reduce the cost of moving money, and by then, there will likely be even more advanced technology to make transactions more efficient.

Also during your commute or down time invest into educating yourself. The two best podcasts I can recommend are ""The Wolf of All Streets"" by Scott Melker and ""The Thinking Crypto Report"" by Tony Edwards. Also learn how to use a cold storage device, Crypto Casey on YouTube has some good videos. Be very careful and selective about who you trust for financial education.

Researchers at ETH Zürich examined the rapidly increasing demand for the number of microwave and DC cables that need to be integrated when scaling from a few-qubit machine to a large-scale one.

Adding to the challenge of heat management, the sheer cost of developing machines with a large number of qubits remains prohibitively expensive. By most estimates, a single qubit costs around $10K and needs to be supported by a host of microwave controller electronics, coaxial cabling and other materials that require large controlled rooms in order to function.”

I dont trade actively much, due to the stresses, but i did 24% per month in bitcoins counted. i.e. much more in dollars counted. So if you put in money that you deem as funds you can't risk, then set up a routine:  keep it on an exchange (reputable one). and then look at the analysis for the markets - especially the 'rumor mill' and be prepared to exit large positions. The reason for the latest uptick is in large part due to Trump - i.e. that he will be crypto friendly and Musk will be his advisor. Since Trump is fickle, that stance can change quickly and it would cause a retraction of the crypto markets.    When it comes to Altcoins and 'gamble' a bit more, I dabble with a number of interesting crypto gaming projects. I believe that is the best use-cases for the youger crypto users and therefore, good crypto gaming projects can take off.

2978,2024-11-10,"I’ve been in crypto since 2018, I must say you’re entry is right in between where people would start say “you bought on top”, and “you entered just in time”, the tokens you mentioned imo are good, because BTC always pumps and you don’t want to fuck up with BTC at a bad entry, and after the BTC pump normally alt coins and memes follow after, plus this coins have still way to go until reaching their ATH, as mentioned below, be aware of volatility and price action, because obviously you didn’t buy on a dip, but rather on a pump, even tho I still think you managed a good entry.

My advice is to try to think about this for the long term, and never try timing the market, just DCA in dips and accumulate as much as you can, remember as of now crypto is being used or held by only 4%-6% of people in the world, people sometimes forget about this and think they are not that early when is completely the opposite.",positive,0.909065,2

It’s gone down the couple days that have passed and that money flow has gone to the alts. 

In past little alt runs as well, you’ll noticed btc dominance went down during those couple days alts ran in that period. Then went back up, and set new btc dominance highs. 

My personal belief is this parabolic run we’ve had for 2-3 days now ya been marked by money flow going to alts, and is a transfer of money before it goes back to btc marking new dominance highs. 

Considering that btc hasn’t topped, and institutional interest hasn’t swelled to its fullest yet, I personally don’t see the beginning of an alt

3133,2024-11-09,"By the end of 2024, many European countries will have made decisions on whether Worldcoin operates within the boundaries of data security regulations. I am quite optimistic on that front; if they can clear this hurdle, it will significantly boost their chances of success. In my mind, Europe is stricter than most regulators, and therefore, from a regulatory perspective, I don’t foresee issues for Worldcoin going forward.

Regarding mass adoption, that’s where the biggest risk lies. However, they have tested the system in many countries, and it has proven to work. Currently, they are scaling operations, particularly in South America. The logistics of scaling—such as producing Orbs and hiring personnel—are more complex than they likely anticipated, and this is the current bottleneck. I recommend checking the [worldcoin.org](http://worldcoin.org) website daily to monitor how the numbers are increasing.

Furthermore, if you look at what Sam Altman says about developments at OpenAI, it’s genuinely mind-blowing. He has stated that AGI is coming next year, and we are about 1,000 days away from reaching superintelligent AI.

Now, imagine we’re six months into the future: OpenAI has made big announcements, and Worldcoin has reached 10-12 million verified users, with a total of 20 million users. They’re seeing weekly sign-ups of 300,000 to 400,000 users (right now we are at 170,000 new orb verified users per week and with currently 900 orbs online). Additionally, we are at the beginning of the bull cycle, and altcoin season will likely start as soon as the Federal Reserve announces they will stop reducing their balance sheet (i.e., resume buying securities). You can expect WLD to rise in price simply because it is in the top 100 of coins.

If, for instance, people receive $300 for their Genesis grant by verifying with the Orb, what do you think will happen? People will start lining up like mad. This, in turn, will trigger more publicity, and things will go crazy.

And then there’s the mini-apps dimension on top of this. Next year, they plan to announce that you will be able to use AI agents within the World App ecosystem.

Regarding the use case of World ID, it’s simply obvious. Next year, with so many AI agents performing various tasks, it’s going to get incredibly annoying. For example, you can already automate processes where AI voice bots call people/businesses. Who will ever pick up a phone call from a random number again when you’re spammed by bots non-stop? This is especially disruptive for businesses. World ID has numerous other uses cases (social media, dating apps, ecommerce/coupons, token drops, ID verifications, concert tickets, etc.)

Now, let’s imagine a crazy AI-driven world where we reach 1 billion users. The total supply is fixed at 10 billion tokens. I can easily see the market cap reaching $1 trillion, which would put the price at $100 per token. Just look at the trends in crypto adoption and the amount of money flowing into this space. I think that by the 2030s, we will have over 4 billion people using crypto, with potentially 50 trillions invested in the crypto space. Worldcoin has the potential to be in the top 10 coins.",positive,0.79896855,1

Start with learning the basics and maybe join some community chats to learn from others. The candlestick stuff you're studying is a great start!

Before and during Trumps first term, a lot of Russian bitcoin miners were in full force as Russia was trying to build up their war chest for Ukraine. Along with that, crypto is a great currency for avoiding the dollar, taxes and criminal activity. 

Putin didn't expect the sanctions Biden hit him with and had to sell off a lot of assets and use up his war chest to keep Russia going while selling oil at a horribly discounted rate. 

Now powers that don't like America want a way to avoid sanctions and Crypto is that answer.

Do NOT answer any DMs with people offering help.

If you want to learn about crypto, that's great and welcome to the club. But be warned. It is unregulated and largely unsafe. 

There are rules, if you stick to them your funds will stay safe.

In terms of exchanges (eg Coinbase), they're fine. Some other options include crypto.com, KRAKEN, Uphold and binance. These are all fairly sizeable and largely trusted exchanges.

I would absolutely recommend NOT storing your funds in an exchange. Look up what happened to FTX.

Buy a ""cold wallet"", learn how to send crypto to it from an exchsnge, back up your seed phase in physical form (eg laminated paper), make copies and place them in safe spots - tell nobody else. Never, under any circumstances put them online or on your computer even saved as a file. Keep them offline and you're safe (for now, quantum computing unsure‍).",positive,0.92548746,0

3529,2024-11-08,"Yeah make sure that risk is “tightly controlled” hahhaahaha. Tight SL = lower winrate. Here’s how to actually use leverage and control risk and I’m assuming you’re gonna trade perpetual contracts on crypto exchanges. You set your SL on tradingview based off market structure, it can be any %, it’s gonna be different for every trade. Once you have that, you should know how much you’re risking. Let’s say you wanna risk 2% of your account per trade. Keep that 2% or whatever x% you use fixed, then calculate your position size by taking risk in $ amount whatever it is for you and dividing it by distance from entry to SL. Let’s say you risk 10$ and let’s say your SL is 2% -> 10/0,02. That means you have to open position with 500$. Now this is where leverage comes into play! If you risk 10$ and that is 2% of your account, that means your account is 500$… so instead of putting your whole account to open that trade you can use leverage. You can use 2x, 10x, 20x, it doesn’t matter as long as your SL is smaller than the liquidation price. For 2% SL, 20x can easily work. Now you can open position with only 25$ instead of 500$ and guess what, your risk is still 10$. This is how you use leverage. You don’t use it to make more profits xD, you’re not gonna make any profits at all if you’re not profitable and if you’re not willing to play the long game. So you’re gonna be risking the same amount on every trade even tho you can use 20x leverage, that is called proper risk management. That’s how you do it. Forget all this nonsense “leverage is not safe, I only go for 2x, maybe 3x max”, ofc it’s not safe when you don’t know what you’re doing. If you approach trading with risk in mind first, it’s gonna be safe. So you don’t use leverage to “make more profits”, instead you use it to manage the risk properly that is appropriate for your account size. You’re welcome ;)",positive,0.90134674,2

3607,2024-11-06,"Wow there are a ton of wrong answers in this thread.

The answer has to do with the crypto community's outlook on Ethereum, the natural order of things, and Vitalik's questionable actions and statements as of lately.

The outlook on Ethereum is bearish. The rise of Solana took an entire generation of new liquidity out of the ecosystem.  You can't blame Solana though, Ethereum has been sick for quite awhile.  The uptick in difficult-to-detect honeypots has given new users a minefield of scams to walk through only to run smack dab into a skill curve that's nearly impossible to scale. High transaction fees make a trifecta of repelling new liquidity, and without a steady inflow, things simply dried up. 


Vitalik has come under fire recently for blockchain stagnation, scalability issues, and for selling Ethereum supply (which he denies). Personally I can't imagine why there's FUD over him selling, who gives a shit, but i digress. 


VB has never really faced pressure like he is today, and so far he hasn't dealt with it spectacularly. Vitalik's not exactly a degen, and degens have been being degens on Twitter. instead of ignoring this criticism, which is one step away from trollling, Vitalik's chosen to retort to individual responses on twitter, often saying things considered.. unbecoming of a blockchain owner.   honestly ETH is my home and Vitalik hasnt really done much to deserve the amount of criticism he's taken. it's just degens being shitty trolls.

Lastly, and this is just speculation, but this is just the natural order of things. ETH was king for a long long time. I'm not happy about Solana's scene but i do understand it's time to step aside and let ETH concentrate on self-improvement for a while. 

There are a few other things, but this is mainly the reason ETH has decoupled from BTC on this run.  But as we saw today, BTC is still pulling it up, just slower than others, so it may be a great time for short to mid term gains.",positive,0.491387,0

The real question is not which token has the best tech to do so, as any small shitcoin can outperform the cobolt banking transaction system of today. The real question is what blockchain company can adapt in real world application and competition, including regulations. 

If banks really are going to start mass adopting blockchain transactions, they are going to do so slowly and when they trust a blockchain solution that has gone through regulation.  

I would say XRP is still the number 1 candidate to do so. Especially after the incident with SEC.

Liquidity is important to understand if you don't want to get rekt on a memecoin though, and it and can be totally different to market cap or volume. The price impact (very commonly confused with slippage which is a little different) of any buys or sells depends entirely on liquidity.

Say I have 10 trading cards, and my friend Bill buys one of them from me for $1000, but nobody else really wants one and the most that the rest of the market would pay is $5.

The market cap of the cards calculates to $10,000 from the last sale price, but there isn't $10,000 of liquidity because Bill only wanted one card (and might even have been manipulating the price here...) and nobody else will pay more than $5 for each of the cards.

Bill and I could also collude to repeatedly buy and sell one card back and forth between each other 1000 times at the same $1000 price. Now the trading cards did $1,000,000 in exchange volume today! Wow!

But still they're worth about $50 in total, because that's all that the real market will actually pay for them.

3947,2024-11-02,"My answer to this is not Shib based but generally speaking. During times of hype or trending markets, new participants are attracted, which provides liquidity as fresh buy orders flow in. This extra liquidity allows large holders to exit positions without causing a massive price drop. Large whales often cash out through numerous smaller trades to avoid impacting the market, instead of dumping in a single transaction.

General rule of thumb: pos sizes that are more than 5% of market volume tend to impact the market at entry/exit.

Also, some large holders may use OTC desks to offload significant portions off market or utilize liquidity pools in decentralized exchanges, minimizing slippage and spread impact(Binance has OTC services, but usually offered to large ass orders). 
SLs from other participants can also trigger buy orders as prices dip slightly, providing further liquidity to support exits(market takers losing and becoming market makers)

Overall, it’s about gradually unloading positions, utilizing different strategies to manage risk and avoid tanking the market.

Judging by that strategy though, that would mean that the vast majority of top altcoins are a bad choice. ALGO, XRP, ADA, SHIB, DOGE, TRX, BCH, DOT and others all don't have higher than average volume. So that tells you that the real big boys aren't really interested in those coins.

* Performance metrics like gains/losses, ROI, and win/loss ratios.
* Insights into trading behavior and patterns.

Many staking platforms have a time based element, so considering entry into a 12 month staking program now is definitely not something I would consider.   In fact for me, 90 days staking would mean a lot of thought, anything above, absolutely not.  The majority of my staking is with a 28 day staking lock up, I have 3 coins in a 90 day staking program.  I have three coins in a 12 month lock up, all three will be free before 2035 starts.   Additionally, I have three coins that are in more than 12 months lock up, all three will be free in less than 4 months from now.

I can only understand it when you're in the very early stages of a bull market, like about a year ago, and you know you've got six months before anything at all plays out. Plus you can often get a good APR back with a new token since offering stupid rates are a form of advertising for them.

If you want dividend returns you're far better off looking for those types of stocks in the regular market where you can still get out when you choose and don't have near as much of a chance of investing in a failing company.

Smart thing to do is liquidate the reward to fiat, squirrel away the taxes due, then reinvest or enjoy the non taxable amount.  I can tell you what happens when you “claim and restake”, but then the value of the token plummets….. you still owe the taxes, but your tokens are (or could be) worthless

For example, I was staking Zilliqa when it was 17 cents getting 5,000 tokens every 24-36 hours.  Instead of cashing out, I restake them to get even more staking rewards.  Everyday, I’m collecting and retaking, rinsing and repeating.  Then Zilliqa (and the rest of crypto) tanked.  My Zil was worth waaaaaayyyyy less, but I owed $200k in taxes.  Had to reach into my pocket for that, and it hurt.  So, if you’re smart, staking is great.  Just be smart.

Otherwise, in my opinion - dump those and just restructure for something like below. you want projects with strong narratives - stuff that whales use to pump coins like wildfire. 

BTC / ETH - stable coins

SOL - upcoming stable coin

Sui / Aero / Moonwell / Render - 5x - 20x easily on these alt coins. 

don't hold too many coins, you want to aim for multiples by consolidating your capital on the fewer assets. 

if you spread yourself too thin, you may hit high multiples on some projects, but it will be MUCH harder to manage and sell at DCA-out exits, in addition you will not get as much profits because your entry DCAs would have been much lower compared to just spreading your capital on fewer projects to both spread risk and setup proper entry levels.",positive,0.8607523,11

This is crucial for Web3 interoperability because it allows different blockchains and decentralized applications (dApps) to interact securely without relying on traditional trust models. In  Web3, where users control their own data and interact with various platforms, ensuring secure communication and data exchange is crucial.

Zero trust protocols achieve this by implementing several key principles:

* **Explicit verification:** Every user and device must be authenticated and authorized before accessing any resource or data.
* **Least privilege access:** Users are only granted the minimum necessary permissions to perform their tasks, limiting potential damage from compromised accounts.
* **Microsegmentation:** The network is divided into smaller, isolated segments, preventing lateral movement and minimizing the impact of security breaches.
* **Continuous monitoring:** User and device activity is continuously monitored for suspicious behavior, allowing for rapid response to potential threats.",positive,0.92790157,1

1.	Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Investigate the project, team, and community behind the memecoin.
2.	Set Clear Goals: Determine how much you want to invest and establish profit targets and loss limits.
3.	Avoid FOMO: Don’t buy just because everyone else is. Stick to your strategy.
4.	Stay Informed: Keep an eye on news and social media trends, but filter out rumors.
5.	Diversify Your Investments: Spread your risk and don’t put all your money into one memecoin.
6.	Know When to Cut Losses: Be prepared to realize losses if the price drops significantly.
7.	Watch for Scams: Be cautious of coins without a transparent team or roadmap.

This is already a non-issue. gTrade for example utilizes lookbacks to capture the order down to the fraction and does not let latency affect the trade. It remembers your trade and ensures the values you entered are exited your trade are honored regardless of the on chain latency. 

""CEXs still account for the bulk of all futures volumes, but DeFi options and perps are now much closer in terms of user experience. This is thanks partially to protocols migrating to L2s where fees are lower and throughput is higher, and also due to better design that has made perps platforms such as [GMX](https://gmx.io/) on Arbitrum a viable alternative to CEX trading. The number of markets that perps protocols such as [dYdX](https://dydx.exchange/) can support has also increased significantly, allowing access to hundreds of digital assets. Improved onchain liquidation engines, meanwhile, ensure that positions which become under-collateralized don’t threaten the health of the entire protocol.""

GMX is not on a layer 2, and DYDX may as well ask for your anal swab to trade. Let's be real. Decentralized still means something to allot of us, and we can't sacrifice half in half out products when on-chain trading exists. Gains has 225+ assets and deep liquidity.

Hoping for the insane pandemic increases right now is just unrealistic. 
The amount of advertising from exchanges, influencers/famous people, crypto-interesr groups (like how BTC has absolutely massive promotion groups, that spend a shit ton of money marketing, merch/branding, positive online news articles etc, and many other coins do as well. 

This all went to insane levels during the length of the pandemic. Many people stuck at home, seeing promotion of crypto everywhere, success stories and just general FOMO creating campaigns, and with Stimulus checks in the USA, and covid benefit payments from places like Canada, and I imagine other parts of the world had similar programs, pumped a shit load of money into both crypto, and stock markets. 

That was an extremely unique opportunity, that all happened so incredibly fast. The conditions for that just aren't there right now. 
Your average person who maybe bought crypto during the pandemic or took interest in it, are now terrified of crypto markets and the potential volatility, abundance of scams/rug pulls, exchanges and wallet providers exit scamming, you know, just all the horror stories. 

Your average person is more weary and less trusting or even interested in crypto right now. 
Many made a lot of money. Many also lost their lifetime of savings. 

So realistically, the conditions just aren't there right now, outside of pump and dump meme coins maybe, which are pretty well scams, just scams that some people manage to get in on early, becoming a part of the scam, making massive profits.

Many coins have been following patterns that keep repeating, bouncing off upper and lower supports. Every 2-3 months, sometimes shorter so many coins rise and fall 10-20% over and over again. Because of that, if you're smart, patient and have a strong mental constitution, and a half decent dose of luck, you'll be able to make much more *right now* swing trading than just holding awaiting some ""parabolic"" price movement, that without some huge catalyst to cause massive FOMO, trust and interest in crypto again, simply isn't coming (again, in the current conditions, not saying it can't or won't ever happen again.)

You'll likely be able to far outperform average stock index returns, multiple times over over the course of a year. Compound your gains into your purchase power after selling on the last high, you'll be able to buy back in for even more at the next low, and keep repeating.

from the genesis of shitcoins back on ethereum, the best traders in the game have always focused on launches. that was where you made the most money: the 1000x'es.

seems obvious right?

but then about 18 months ago, a few things started: 

1) bundling arrived. i should know, unfortunately, im the one who brought it to the space. 
2) the sniper pool got too big.
3) the new launch pool got too big.

then about 6 months ago the number of extremely hard-to-detect honeypots skyrocketed.

as time progressed, these four factors steadily raised the risk and lowered the reward until only the richest snipers remained. with no snipers to provide volume and taxes, the dev population followed suit. i'm basically an out of work dev.

now only the richest snipers are in a position to make 1000x gains anymore. the rich get richer. this is called the Matthew Effect, and its the core of why 1000xs are gone.

so in the last 2 months we've seen a mass migration of volume out of <$1m coins into coins above $1m mc

have you noticed that there's a lot more mooners in the space lately?  it's not volume--volumes only increased a little. it's that the risk/reward for those monster gains is skewed so heavily in favor of risk, that degens finally just said ""fuck this i'll settle for a 100x"", and all the < $1m mc volume has moved to > $1m coins.",positive,0.80964774,1

Op is expecting massive gains, going on a little bit of research they have done, but doesn’t seem to understand that if you are entering now, you are already half way through this bull run, that started in January of 23, so don’t expect massive gains. 

I’ll use sol as an example. If you buy that now you may get a 5x, which is great. 

But If you got in at $20 last year you are already up nearly 7x. So if we 5x again that’s a massive 35x. 

It’s called compounding. Getting in early is key to making massive gains, and op isn’t early and could well get wrecked waiting for huge gains that simply aren’t possible at this stage.

Be careful going on past cycles, look at onchain data and indicators and macro conditions and ignore past cycles would be my advice. That way if we top early you’ll be better prepared, but also if we get a super cycle, which is also possible (ETFs and huge institutional adoption) then you’ll be ready for that too. Also one last thing, know that statistically most noobs get wrecked on their first cycle. I know I did. Good luck thumbs up

Also, you need to realise you’re entering this cycle half way through the bull run, which started early last year. So don’t expect bonkers gains. They are reserved for the people like me who were buying SOL at $20 and have already made 7x.

I usually check my investments once a week, but I'm unsure if I need to constantly buy and sell altcoins like Solana or if I can just dollar-cost average. How often do I need to sell altcoins? Should I be selling when it reaches a peak, or is a long-term hold approach more effective?

On September 22nd, a new PyPI user orchestrated a wide-ranging attack by uploading multiple packages within a short timeframe. These packages, bearing names like “AtomicDecoderss,” “TrustDecoderss,” “WalletDecoderss,” and “ExodusDecodes,” masqueraded as legitimate tools for decoding and managing data from an array of popular cryptocurrency wallets.


The attack targeted users of Atomic, Trust Wallet, Metamask, Ronin, TronLink, Exodus, and other prominent wallets in the crypto ecosystem. Presenting themselves as utilities for extracting mnemonic phrases and decrypting wallet data, these packages appeared to offer valuable functionality for cryptocurrency users engaged in wallet recovery or management. However, behind the scenes, these packages would fetch malicious code from dependencies to covertly steal sensitive cryptocurrency wallet data, including private keys and mnemonic phrases, potentially granting the attackers full access to victims’ funds.

I prefer automated trading since it takes the psychological aspect out of the equation, if your confident in your approach. I prefer [ccxt](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt) / [ccxtpro](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt/wiki/ccxt.pro) because it allows traders to use the same source code (python) across exchanges with minimal changes to the code aside from api credentials and exchange specific order statuses. Ccxt isn't automated trading itself but rather allows traders to create systems more easily than implementing systems using the exchange api documentation.

I've found linear regression to be a great way to calculate trade entry conditions as well as using it as a global hold or sell strategy in the event the underlying statistics fail. I've also found trailing stops loss profit taking to be quite helpful in protecting profits by moving the stop loss up to the last triggered profit level when submitting multiple sell orders using an order level spread.

* Some coins let you unstake anytime, others have lock-up periods
* It's not risk-free - crypto prices can still drop

For your specific coins:

* ETH: Can be staked for ETH 2.0
* HBAR: Uses proxy staking to nodes
* XRP: Doesn't use traditional staking, but some exchanges offer ""staking-like"" rewards

@u/Crypto__Sapien

1. What's the difference between lending and staking?
2. What's the point of lending/staking as the APY is relatively low while volatility of crypto currency price is high? Or by an example: if you lend/stake at 3% APY and crypto's day-to-day volatility is in the range 2-10%, then you're basically gambling with your gains that you've made from lending/staking. Am I wrong?
3. Is it maybe better, that instead of lending/staking one invests in MMFs/bonds? The APY is similar (few %) while the risk is very low, therefore those few % of APY are almost guaranteed?",positive,0.8827524,1

5481,2024-10-17,"Hey, thanks for your questions, I am only seeing them now, sorry bout that. So lending vs staking goes like that:

Lending: You loan your crypto to others, usually through a platform

Staking: You ""lock up"" your crypto to support the network

Main difference: Lending is purely financial, staking helps run the blockchain

2. APY vs Volatility:

   * You're not wrong - crypto's wild swings can overshadow staking gains
   * But remember, you're earning more of that crypto, not fiat
   * If prices go up long-term, those small gains could become significant
   * It's a way to grow your stack without buying more

  
3. Staking vs Traditional Investments:

   * MMFs/bonds are definitely lower risk
   * Crypto staking can offer higher rewards, but with more risk
   * It really depends on your risk tolerance and belief in crypto's future

Key points:

* Staking/lending can be a way to make your crypto work for you
* It's not risk-free - always consider the trade-offs
* For some, it's about supporting the networks they believe in
* Diversification is key - maybe do a mix of crypto and traditional investments?

I'd add that transparency from the project team is huge—regular updates on progress and any hurdles can really build trust. Plus, an informed community is less likely to freak out during market dips. A good community also helps with decentralization because they can get involved in decision-making, and their support can help a project survive rough times.

5559,2024-10-09,"Depends on income stream. 
For those that can earn large amounts of cash during bear markets, don’t need to necessarily re-invest. Some investors and retail can easily invest +$100k during bear markets without pre-existing bull run profits. 
If you work a regular job, making less than $150k and have a lot of responsibilities, then ya, you want to be very careful with allocation and pulling out well before potential ATH. Because contract sell wont initiate without someone actually buying or putting in a swap contract for you exiting your positions. 

Over 93%-95% of people - Large majority of people will roundtrip their bags into the zeros, and then sell into the zeros, make many alt coins go into the deeper ocean of the lowest zeros. 
“Just hold” .. is a winners curse, thinking market will go up and up and up forever. 
Too many people are comfortable throwing money at the market and have virtually zero knowledge of prior cycles and project movement narratives - just take profits on ladder out. 

Yes, ZERO- the 0.0xx zone. 

You want to DCA in at lows, and DCA out during euphoria. 
One reallly big indicator, is look at YouTube view counts on popular social media crypto influencers. 

Extremely important - Keep portion of BTC, because it may not dip below $100k after 2024-2025 bull run.  

Alt coins, for massively reputable projects, don’t sell 100% of bags, because some projects will also not hit ATL of the past several years.

Be careful of trading with economic news.

Are you doing any DCA or did you buy your coins in bulk? 

May I ask you why 5/10 years is your horizon, do you base this on an analysis, or simply a price projection of previous patterns?

I have a view where I use DCA heavy during ""lower prices"". What do I mean by this? I have a system that tells me, more or less, when prices are cheap based on previous patterns. For example, when Bitcoin has dropped more than 33% from it's latest top, I start to buy, then when it drops to -50% I double my DCA investments and if it reaches a -65%, or more, from the latest top I consider that a massive bargain and I maximize my investments due to low pricing.

5568,2024-10-10,"Nope. And I don't really understand why anyone would.

With as much confidence as anyone can say BTC follows a four-year cycle and goes up during those bull markets, we also have to say that it goes down in that same four-year cycle during crypto bear markets. So why the heck would anyone hold if you have confidence it's going to go down?

If you sold BTC at the height of the market last cycle and bought back in at 16k, you'd have an additional three BTC. And certainly I get that nobody is ever going to time the market perfectly, the same principle applies if you sold at 50k and bought back in at 25k--one additional BTC to you.

I'm pretty convinced that 95% of the ""diamond hands"" people are just folks who bought in too high and held way too long into a bear market, lost a lot of money, and are now simply trying to convince themselves they didn't actually make a poor decision. Heck, I held on too long last cycle, too, but it's okay to say you didn't play things perfectly right--nobody ever does.

The more volatile the market, or even the more volatile the specific asset you own, the less time you should hold it. And the crypto market is 8x more volatile than the stock market. But the same applies to the stock market.

People are making the argument that with ETFs and BTC options trading being approved, that'll really tamper the cycle action moving forward and it's a reasonable argument. And if that ends up being the case, than sure, that would call for a different buying/selling/holding strategy. But if one accepts the cycle theory or at least that it still applies to this one, there's no reason not to sell when you think we're at/near the cycle top.",positive,0.76697737,1

I think we are just ENTERING a bull market that’s going to last 2-3 years. 

These pumps on the crypto charts the last year are bearish retests of technical analysis patterns. 

Personally - the only way I’m buying Bitcoin is if it sees a flash crash to 10,000 to 20,000 - It’s due for a serious correction and a drop like that means there’s buyer orders to fill. 

If Bitcoin just keeps going up slowly, I don’t see it as a stable long term growth asset. In my opinion, the only way it’s going to see 100-200k is IF it sees a liquidity sweep to the low zones of 10-20k. 

People will laugh at me and call my crazy I’m used to it. I’m not telling anyone what to do with their money; I know what I do with mine. And the only way I’m investing a % of my investment portfolio into bitcoin is if it sees that flash crash / liquidity sweep to 10-20k because from the way I’ve learned to read charts, that’s what it’s been setting up to do for a long time and it’s just a matter of time before that happens.

At the same time the existence of “memecoins” as they were, infinitely expanding tokens, sorta frontruns the utility of these smart contracts, and projects like dogecoin even have their own chains now. Yes a lot is pump and dump but then where does it pump and dump to? Either back into fiat which is the original hedge of bitcoin, or it gets transposed into a new pump and dump.

Copying and pasting an existing protocol and tweaking the numbers is still quite a difficult thing to do. I think people like a certain level of personal ownership to their capital functions.

5891,2024-10-06,"Whoah sir. Ok listen. **There are plenty of decentralized exchanges around these days.** The thing about trust is you don't have to trust kraken, binance, etc when trading on chain because any DEX worth its salt utilizes the blockchain to its **advantage.** 

At gTrade for example, (clarification I work for gTrade) there is no deposits. There is only self custody. My advice is create a new wallet and send trading funds to it, keep the rest in cold storage. Refill as necessary. gTrade has a one click feature that gives it permission to trade on your wallets behalf, making everything one click with no wallet signatures over and over.  

gTrade has 220 assets including crypto, forex, commodities and has been around since 2021. 80 billion in volume has been processed. No KYC. Just trade on chain. gTrade goes from 2x to 150x on crypto, 1500x on forex. Find gTrade on Base, Arbitrum, and Polygon.  
  
You may say ""the fees are pricier than a centralized exchange"" but what is the true cost when your funds get locked up in a 5 year long legal battle when the exchange mysteriously goes under? What's the cost when you cant withdraw? Or when your account closes down due to KYC getting roled out?

We have blockchain, we have self custody, we have smart contracts. Let's start using them to avoid the exact scenario you mentioned above. Even if you don't use gTrade explore the available dex out there and support decentralized finance!",positive,0.9281772,4
5892,2024-10-07,"I feel you, man, on the fees really eating into profits when it comes to shorter trades. I've tried a few different platforms, and often you're left thinking that any little percent here or there just gets chipped away. In respect, I am in the same situation with those bigger exchanges you mentioned, and yeah, I've seen some of those Trustpilot horror stories.



Lately, I've been using [Altrady](https://altrady.com/s/Siren-Cat), which kind of changed things up for me. It's not an exchange itself, but more like a platform that lets you trade on multiple exchanges from one place. So, I'm still using the bigger exchanges like Binance, but I have way more control over my trades. The cool part is that you can use their smart trading tools-stop-loss and take profit-in one go. It helped me manage risk better, especially when doing those shorter trades.



I've found that it makes a huge difference by using Altrady with exchanges that charge you lower fees, depending on your trading volume. Plus, their integration really helps to keep an eye on those fees beforehand without having to commit to a trade. Worth checking out if you're tired of losing profit to fees!",positive,0.8398565,2

6110,2024-10-05,"Perhaps it depends on where/how/when the process started. So ~thinking from the other side of the camera. 

I was mostly thinking along the lines of it depending on the nature of the expose and the investment / returns involved. Investigative journalism requires investment, (as well as time and planning) as does documentary making. Documentary making is more expensive, and has a longer timeline to release.

If there had been a conclusive explosive discovery as part of investigation, then that would be more at risk via a longer, naturally more leaky documentary-making process.

If the process had started with investigation, and discovery was made as part of that - I'm picking that the logical way to approach release would be to try to completely own an announcement news cycle around it, go live with that first, and aim to monetize appearances, access, interviews, as well as 'official documentary' licensing rights etc.  If the timing risk had been taken to cobble together a documentary to leverage the news, then that would probably follow the announcement in order to maximize viewership and feed the attention/hype flywheel.

If on the other hand the documentary was financed from the outset as a 'Search for Satoshi' process based documentary - perhaps a different scenario applies. Perhaps for the sake of analogizing that scenario: replace 'Satoshi' with 'Loch Ness Monster' - if said process-focused documentary did manage to discover the monster, it would be huge scientific and general interest news, and unlikely to be kept under wraps until documentary release, which at a guess would be at least months (?) later after post production, promotion plans, scheduling, syndication, etc. In the Satoshi instance, there would be definite interest from the financial, technical, and general news categories, and also to note a very strong financial incentive to front-run any news that could result in market moves <~ that's actually not something to ignore. Obviously there's a fairly decent amount of capital tied up with Bitcoin globally, which also auto-qualifies this sort of story for news attention, if there is substance to it.

Personal view is that the announcement/promo campaign for this primarily looks like HBO creating advance hype around the screening. I'm guessing as a pre-commissioned item as opposed to pre-made and then sold, but that's probably neither here nor there. So their sole aim will be driving viewing numbers, and subscriptions - and they will have a well organised system and network for orchestrating that - which is part of why there is breadth of coverage across outlets etc. If it does well then that won't hurt / will help external syndication/licensing should they choose to go outside of exclusivity.

I might be wrong though too unsure‍ - I guess we'll see soon either way.",positive,0.92453873,1
