Because it sounds cool? Its a vague catchphrase that can mean anything, like America being the land of the free. 

\> when it seems like financial institutions, corporations, and other large entities are the ones accumulating most of it

Because they are co-operative entities comprising of numerous individuals with wealth. Thus, they control a lot of wealth compare to some one guy. 

\>I can imagine a future where the vast majority‚Äîmaybe over 90%‚Äîof Bitcoin is owned by these big players, leaving less than 10% in the hands of ordinary people.

In all advanced economies, the wealthy control a disproportionate percentage of wealth. So you should expect the distribution of Bitcoin to follow a similar path. There is nothing in the Bitcoin protocol that says that everyone should have an equal amount of bitcoins. If your think that everyone having an equal amount of wealth is a good thing, I'd suggest you read more about communism. If you are stupid, you might find that communism is more your thing, not Bitcoin. If you are smart, you'll find that communism is stupid and human societies function horribly when the government forces an equal distribution of wealth amongst its populace.

\> Bitcoin would become extremely difficult for the average person to acquire because no one would want to sell, and its accessibility could disappear entirely.

No because bitcoin can be subdivided into smaller units. Yes, it will be harder and harder to own a single bitcoin as the price appreciates.

I'm using it, because i'm looking on it as an provider for compounding interest on my crypto assets, mainly.

I'm I using only them ?

651,1gu7heu,lxrsjc4,"Fiat survives on debt, therefore there's an arbitrage opportunity called the cantillon effect.¬† Debt acts as a gatekeeper in the fiat system, by locking up economic value in a form that can only be unlocked by completing the payment obligations. This ensures that the financial system has a steady stream of obligations that help sustain the flow of currency, which gives fiat currency its value.


Raising interest rates actually works by cutting off this debt, as well as new money supply the debt creates, so people in aggregate can't buy as many goods if debt is more expensive to survice.¬† More debt needs to be created to pay off the old debt, as the new debt creates the extra money supply to pay the interest on the old debt, so people begin to default on their past debt as rates rise, and we usually get a 2008 style recession.

Bitcoin is nothing more than a tracker of possession and a zero-sum game. Coins are only transferred to one another. Coins are only created (mined) by the network as a reward for mining the block. There is no situation where unmined coins can be bought. The mined coins are in possession of an address and the unmined coins are still in the network (to be rewarded after a block has been mined).

The only time you can buy coins is when coins have been awarded and that same address wants to sell you its coins. Exchanges have bought many coins and will sell you the coins at the exchange rate. When they sell out, the only way for them to acquire more coins is to buy coins from some other address that wants to sell.

Honestly this is a very interesting question. I consider myself more savvy than most when it comes to traditional investing. Until recently I was just going to manage everything myself.  I mean what's so hard, you toss half of it into an index fund and then half of it into bonds or something. Or alternatively you sign up with a robo-broker and just let the algorithms run it. 

  
For me it came down to a question of expertise. There's value in having an expert run things for you. I've been in the IT industry for 30 years and I ALWAYS bitched about people who would try to cobble together their own solutions for something and ended up with an inferior result. If they'd just consult an expert they'd get a better result for less time/money.

936,1gu0wxi,lxqfu74,"No. The point of the hardware wallet is that it doesn't allow you to copy the key off the hardware wallet. Instead it performs the transaction signing itself and returns the signed transaction to the computer. 

The difference is basically the API that the device exposes to the computer it's plugged into. An SD card has a filesystem API that does things like roadblock and writeblock. A hardware wallets API on the other hand allows writekey or maybe createkey to have it generate one itself and signtransaction to sign a transaction. But notice no readkey API. You can't read the key off the device back to the computer.

A common device that could perhaps do this is a simcard. It works the same way and for the same reason - to stop you cloning the phone ki and using the same account on multiple phones.

I'm not really sure why simcards aren't commonly used perhaps there's no implementation of the bitcoin tx signing algorithm available and noone trusts themselves to try and make one? I suppose for the end user most may not have a smart ard reader so it makes sense to make something with a usb interface. Another key point is that the hardware wallet usually needs a screen and buttons in order to allow you to securely verify that it's signing the right thing. If it just blindly signs whatever the computer gives it, then the computer might switch transactions on you.. in the wallet software you might construct a transaction that pays to the pizza delivery yous address but when you plug in the hardware wallet it swaps the tx to one paying a hacker before sending it to the hardware wallet.

You sell your btc, incur capital gains taxes, buy the house, and lets just assume it all worked perfectly for you to have enough left. The only problem is, while you were doing all of this, bitcoin experienced a supply shock as the US govt started buying bitcoin for its strategic reserve, sparking a ""Bitcoin Cold War"" where the countries of the world see the US buying bitcoin, and they want some as well to keep up. The price accelerates upward, exchanges are nearly bone dry. Nation states turn directly to miners offering them lucrative deals to buy btc directly from them. Meanwhile, your 300K stack that you had, would've been worth 2million by this point, but your house is still only worth 280k to 350k, and you can't find bitcoin to buy on exchanges.

The other option is to put it all into bonds, theoretically it's a guaranteed return, currently around 5% a year.  You could simply get a mortgage and pay the monthly payment with the income from bonds.

Once, the pound was the world reserve currency. During WWII, the UK racked up a debt-to-gdp ratio over 250%. In 1931, **the pound went off the gold standard**. Over the course of 30 or 40 years, the UK managed to get the debt-to-gdp ratio back under control, below a respectable 50%.

How?

**They inflated the debt away** by debasing the currency. But the inevitable result was that **the pound tanked in value**‚Äîdropping from $5 per pound to $1 per pound‚Äîand **the** **dollar took its place** as the world reserve currency.

But the UK is still around, isn't it?

A ""collapse"" isn't necessarily a discrete catastrophic event‚Äîit can take decades to play out. The way I see it, **the US dollar is already collapsing**. The US debt-to-gdp ratio recently exceeded 125%. The dollar went off the gold standard in 1971. The US has been rapidly debasing the dollar ever since.

I've read both as have many here, and I think most of us would agree. 

Bitcoin Standard is great but goes off the rails at points - the whole middle portion of the book, really. It starts really strong with its history of money, then he gets kooky with personal biases for a good while taking about US monetary policy in particular, then pulls it back together talking about bitcoin for the last chapters. Super fun easy read that my young daughter could probably grasp. 

Broken Money is still an easy read for lay folk like myself, but a lot more meat on the bone in terms of content. Kinda like reading Chomsky now that I think about it, in that the book is able to communicate complex ideas is an easily digestible format; no reading the same page 5 times trying to grasp some deep concept (talking to you in your grave, Marshall McLuhan). 

Now that I'm fleshing out thoughts, I think I would ideally recommend both, but bitcoin standard first, especially for someone new to bitcoin. Someone who has never heard of btc could pick up a copy bitcoin standard with zero primer and I feel could be fully enthralled, even developing interest to learn further. 

Not sure I could say the same for broken money, but I'd wager 9/10 people who have been into bitcoin awhile and are not named Saifedean, would she that broken money is a better & more complete book that gives you a better and broader understanding of money overall.

Yes, but it was because of trust in that currency.

China has the second-largest economy in the world, despite that, the yuan is a pipsqueak in global currency trade terms. Behind even the Australian dollar - [https://www.ig.com/uk/trading-strategies/what-are-the-top-10-most-traded-currencies-in-the-world-200115](https://www.ig.com/uk/trading-strategies/what-are-the-top-10-most-traded-currencies-in-the-world-200115)

Nobody wants yuan, because the markets rely on trust, and trade dominance doesn't necessarily bring that. When China trades with a country, the USD often acts as an intermediary trade pair. Like instead of yuan > Thai baht. The trade actually goes yuan > USD > Thai baht.

That could change, of course. But I don't detect any hint of a growing global trust in China.

The dollar will be unseated, but I don't think the yuan will be what does it.

The higher fee you're willing to pay, the closer to the new door out of this waiting room your tx is.

Now, a miner will find a new block #870,001. He will look at the mempool and pick as much txs as he can fit into this block. He's profit driven so he will pick the transactions that are paying the highest fees. If you happen to be in this high fees group, your transaction will get written into the new block.

At this point the distributed network of hubs can choose to adopt the new code. If x% take on the new code then that is now considered the Bitcoin standard code. What if we never reach x% and the new code sits there only used by a small %. Do we now have two different Bitcoins? Which one is the Bitcoin I have? And what does the other Bitcoin become?

You have the 24 word seed phrase (guard them with your life!), that uniquely identifies the address which hold the BTC, and you can access that with any wallet software. The wallet software you are using has the 2FA set, if you enter the seed phrase in any other wallet software (I use electrum) you should not have any 2FA, unless you choose that when setting up the new wallet software (but then you also set a new 2FA method which works).

Someone corrects me if I'm wrong, but in testing out electrum I restored a 2FA protected electrum wallet on a different machine, and it worked perfectly, no 2FA required.

1309,1gtxub8,lxpx2l8,"If this is real. You basically have two separate decisions:
1) How much, in terms of percent, do you lump sum buy versus allocate to DCA
2) what period of time do you DCA over

1 is more important. A couple things to note, on average, lump sum, as soon as possible is the best strategy. But it comes with the risk of emotional hurt if there is a large drop in price.

So for #1 do some thought experiments. Imagine allocating 50% to lump sum and 50% to dca. How would you feel given the following circumstances:
1) bitcoin trades sideways
2) bitcoin drops for a period of time (before going back up)
3) bitcoin drops for a long time (unlikely IMO)
4) bitcoin shoots up rapidly and never comes down

Mark down which scenario you would feel the most regret and rate it on a scale of 1-5 (with 1 being no regret, to 5 being the worst of thoughts). Then do the same activity allocating 100% to bitcoin and then with 100% to DCA. Pick the strategy with the worst possible regret being the lowest. You can toy around with the percentages too.

Then move on to decision #2. You could do the same exercise as above but I think this decision matters a lot less. You probably want to think about it in terms of when the next super-cycle will peak: january, April, July, 2026, after that would be rather atypical.

It sounds like you're interested in a self custody wallet. These can be found for free. Otherwise, hardware wallets can be purchased. Each having advantages/disadvantages. Please do some reading before deciding. I recommend moving small sums around in the free options before moving large sums via any option.

And further, before moving any large sums around, please do some reading on security risks. There are common attack vectors (e.g. scams, compromised device, unsafe networks) that are worth being aware of.

1426,1gtuxw8,lxp5tcn,"Explaining Bitcoin to someone who doesn‚Äôt trust digital systems requires framing it in terms they value, like transparency, security, and decentralization, while addressing their concerns about the digital aspect

	1.	Start with What They Value:
Explain that Bitcoin isn‚Äôt controlled by any single entity, government, or corporation. It‚Äôs a system run by a global network of individuals who verify and secure transactions together. This decentralized structure is designed to make it harder to corrupt than centralized digital systems.
	2.	Focus on Its Transparency:
Bitcoin‚Äôs ledger, the blockchain, is fully transparent. Every transaction ever made is publicly recorded and cannot be altered without the consensus of the majority. Compare this to traditional financial systems, where ledgers are private and controlled by a few institutions.
	3.	Highlight the Security Aspect:
Bitcoin uses cryptographic principles to secure transactions, making it one of the most secure systems in existence. Explain how this cryptography doesn‚Äôt rely on trust in a person or institution but on mathematics, which doesn‚Äôt take sides or make mistakes.
	4.	Explain the Physical Connection:
Even though Bitcoin is digital, you can make it tangible. Wallets can be stored offline on hardware devices or even as printed QR codes on paper, much like cash. This gives the owner full control and keeps it separate from the internet.
	5.	Discuss Trust in Systems vs. Trust in People:
If they distrust digital systems because of people misusing them, emphasize that Bitcoin‚Äôs design minimizes human intervention. It operates automatically based on predefined rules in its code.
	6.	Draw Historical Analogies:
Compare Bitcoin to older forms of money. People once doubted paper money when it replaced coins made of precious metals. Bitcoin is another evolution of value storage, just as paper money was.
	7.	Acknowledge Their Concerns:
Don‚Äôt dismiss their skepticism. Instead, agree that no system, digital or not, is perfect. However, explain that Bitcoin tries to solve many flaws in traditional systems by reducing reliance on trust.",13,2024-11-17 21:02:54,1731898974.0,Bitcoin

1730,1gtqsji,lxp0ssu,"It's a sound idea. Since you asked how to do this properly, here are a few very important things to consider:

1. You need buy Bitcoin with the idea of not touching it for 4-5 years at a minimum. Ideally 10+. Why? Because in the past Bitcoin has dropped dramatically, before recovering even more dramatically. Next year we will most likely see a huge upswing, followed by a possible cliff dive in 2026. Past cycles are no guarantee of the future, but you have to be mentally prepared to see it drop by 80% and have the financial solvency and the nerve to not touch it. In fact, in those 80% drops you have to be buying as much as you can. If you can pull that off just for one cycle (4-5 years), depending on how much you stack, you might be set for life. It's a long journey. It will test your character, your will, your temperament, your patience, your foresight, etc. You have to understand that's what you are signing up for. Otherwise, you will most likely panic sell and lose $. 

2. After reaching a few thousand dollars worth of BTC in your account on Cashapp, you should research how to do self-custody, and take possession of your coins. This protects you both from hackers compromising your Cashapp account, and Cashapp going belly up for whatever reason. Good hardware wallets like Jade, coldcard, seedsigner, cost $200 at most, some less than $100. Then a good metal backup to protect from fire or flood, another $100. That's a very low cost for really good security. 

3. Do not talk about how much you are stacking with other people. Do it quietly if possible. If you talk to others, never divulge the size to your stack. That means your own parents, your wife, your kids, your anyone. 10 Bitcoin in early 2017 was $10k. Nobody would have batted an eye about it. But today, 10 BTC is life changing money. You might not think the $1000 a month you dump into BTC today is worth much. But in 10 years, you might not want your friend Gary knowing you have $1 million ""under your mattress."" Save yourself the headache.

No one can guess how quickly your house can close, would you even have that capital readily available to put into bitcoin to maximize gains before this bull run is over. After the fees and costs to sell the home, would you even be profiting or breaking even from the sale of the home? Then you‚Äôre factoring in finding a new place to rent, moving costs, the stress of moving.  
If you put money into bitcoin, would you be taking profit or leaving it in? Do you have the emotions discipline to take that profit out? Or to not panic if there‚Äôs a drop in price? Can you guarantee you‚Äôll be making a profit off Btc in the timeframe you‚Äôll be putting money in?

I agree that everyone should be willing to take risks to better them selfs, but money in the market should always be money you‚Äôre willing to lose. Are you willing to lose a home you‚Äôve worked so hard for if something goes wrong?

My suggestion would be to keep the home, consider taking equity out of the home if you truly feel like you need more capital to get more into the market during this bullrun. But never forget to be smart, never risk what you‚Äôre not okay with losing.

Once these concepts are understood, you can look at Bitcoin & the US dollar and fully understand what makes bitcoin ‚Äúmoney‚Äù, and the US dollar (a fiat currency).. and the implications of both.

1920,1gtmqxr,lxne7l4,"bitcoin is valuable because it solved digital scarcity.¬†

before bitcoin, anything digital was able to be copied infinitely and at no cost.

bitcoin solved digital scarcity by making people that want it to actually use electricity, making them pay a real world physical cost to obtain it which is what mining is. machines that guess a bunch of numbers to find the special number that costs them electricity. if they are lucky they are rewarded bitcoin. they are only rewarded bitcoin because nodes around the world verify that the miner didn‚Äôt cheat.

bitcoin is scarce because the 21 million limit is protected by the nakamoto consensus meaning that the nodes around the world that run the bitcoin protocol that has the code saying the bitcoin limit is 21 million enforce the code by running that version of the bitcoin protocol. if a node runs a different version of the protocol that says bitcoin has a 50 billion limit it is cut off from the network.¬†

so to an extent people give bitcoin value but that value has a real world cost in the form of electricity that costs miners.¬†",11,2024-11-17 14:52:52,1731876772.0,Bitcoin
1921,1gtmqxr,lxnby91,"every 4 years, the rewards for mining a block are halved. Thus, half of all bitcoins to ever come into existence were mined from 2009 to 2012. After the 2016 halving, 75% of all bitcoins to ever exist had been mined. After 2020, it was alread 7/8 of the bitcoin that can ever exist that are already on someones address. After this years halving, the rate at which new bitcoins are mined is relatively lower than the rate at which new gold is mined. That is, bitcoins stock-to-flow ratio is better than that of gold.

How many bitcoins can be mined during each 4-year-cycle is determined by the algorithm, and it adds up to somewhat less than 21 million bitcoins that will ever exist.

Dollars and Euros are created out of thin air every time a bank gives out credit, and back in 2008 we've seen banks that were a bit lazy about checking the collaterals for those credits. Thus, the value of bitcoin is not only determined by the trust people have in an open-source algorithm, but even more by the distrust they have in banks, central banks, governments, and fiat currencies.",5,2024-11-17 14:41:06,1731876066.0,Bitcoin
1922,1gtmqxr,lxncrok,"The value is determined like everything else in a free market system: there is a continuous string of buyers and sellers determining the price via what buyers are willing to pay and what sellers are willing to sell for.

If there's more buyers than sellers, this puts the sellers at an advantage and they can continue to raise the price they're asking for it. When that equation shifts and you suddenly have more sellers than buyers, the price goes down because people are trying to unload for whatever price they can get while buyers get more and more timid in their bid offers to take them off the hands of sellers.

Miners are in control of the supply of new bitcoin. Every halving, they are paid half of what they used to for winning a hash (in terms of number of bitcoin awarded for 'winning' the hash). This decreases the rate of supply dilution, which makes things increasingly bullish as dilution is a form of increasing selling pressure vs buyers. Miners themselves can also act as bid support. If the price of bitcoin dips below the cost it takes for them to mine new bitcoin, they may start to buy them up to keep the price closer to where the cost of mining is and hope that buyers eventually come back and start a buying frenzy driving the price up again.

Eventually buyers \*do\* get into a bit of a frenzy when they see a large uptrend start and the cost to buy bitcoin goes well above the cost to mine it. As price gets really crazy, those who have held bitcoin for awhile (including miners) sense a good opportunity to sell what they have at a very profitable price, eventually this shifts the equation to the point where sellers once again outnumber buyers and the price starts a down cycle again.",5,2024-11-17 14:45:22,1731876322.0,Bitcoin

Naturally, who ever solves the block, sends these bitcoins to themselves, usually the pool, and distributes the rewards. That is how bitcoins are created.

The value is an intersubjective reality. Two or more people have to agree that something has value and then a market is born.

Bitcoin is bigger than money.

For any of us to cooperate, we need a ledger to register trades of goods, services and currencies.

In the beginning, when we were tribes of a maximum of 150, we just remembered. The tribe trusted each other. But that trust doesnt scale.

As we grew and settled with agriculture, we made clay protocuniform tablets, this allowed trust to scale to 1000s.

We then moved to printing press, stronger regulatory governments, we could scale that trust of a list to millions.

We then moved to central databases, that allowed our trust to scale up to nation states of people in the billions.

Every modern state is essentially a ledger of currency, ledger of property titles and a ledger of equities. There are other financial products as well, like bonds, options and futures. These are settled by clearing houses and they scale up to the size of the nation state, but not past it because these central ledgers have to be policed by governments to make sure no one cheats.

Bitcoin scales past that, it's trust scalability is unbounded.

If there are not many people that want to buy it, the price will be low, or close to zero. As demand increases and more people want to have your item, it's price will also increase.

It's the same with Bitcoin. At the beginning, its demand was next to zero, hence there were people giving away free Bitcoins or selling them for pennies. As demand grew, its value and price grew too.

To illustrate the point, gold yes has some real world utility (i.e., jewelry, some industrial applications). But there‚Äôs not nearly enough demand from this to justify its price. Gold ultimately has value because people believe it has value and they trust in it as a store of value.

Bitcoin does the above but overwhelmingly better. The more people believe BTC has value, the greater the demand, the higher the price.",3,2024-11-17 15:55:37,1731880537.0,Bitcoin
1931,1gtmqxr,lxo35ls,"Your question about what causes it to have value is really asking what the basis of money is. I know that sounds condescending, but have you ever thought about it? If you have a chicken that lays eggs and you have a few too many, you could trade me some eggs for some milk from my cow. That barter system works great, as long as there‚Äôs a coincidence of me wanting what you‚Äôre selling at the same time that you want to sell it (and vice versa), and the two things being basically similar in scale and time (if you were trying to sell your eggs to me for a house, I can‚Äôt break down the house and sell you a window here and a bathroom door there, and by the time you could save up enough eggs to buy the whole house, they‚Äôd have rotted and would be useless). Money comes into play here. We can‚Äôt use just anything as money, like if you picked up a leaf of the ground, you couldn‚Äôt trade it for a sandwich, because there are tons of other leaves on the ground. It isn‚Äôt worth my time and money to find the ingredients to make you a sandwich when I could go pick up a leaf off the ground myself. That‚Äôs scarcity. We also can‚Äôt use things that are easy to introduce into the currency system; look up David O‚ÄôKeefe and the Yap Rai stones. If it‚Äôs easy to introduce more currency into the currency system, it severely devalues the currency to the point of being worthless (like the modern Venezuelan currency or Aggri beads in Africa). The relationship of how much we have to how much we can introduce is called stock-to-flow, and it‚Äôs why gold is ‚Äúthe gold standard.‚Äù We have a decent amount of it in the system already, but because it‚Äôs rare, hard and costly to mine, and hard and costly to refine, there‚Äôs a practical limit to how much can be added to the system. The amount of new gold introduced to the world economy every year is only like 1.5% of what already was there. The higher the stock-to-flow ratio, the better use it is for currency. The only reason the American dollar has any value is because a whole bunch of people have agreed that it has value‚Ä¶ Once upon a time, the governments said ‚Äúwe know it‚Äôs really hard to carry around all this heavy gold. Just give it to us and we‚Äôll hold onto it for you and we‚Äôll give you these paper receipts instead. If you want to buy something, you can give them this receipt and they can bring it to us to get the gold.‚Äù As time went on, people trusted the government money (‚ÄúFiat currency,‚Äù after the Latin word ‚ÄúFiat‚Äù for ‚Äúmandate‚Äù) more and more, and stopped bothering to ask to get the gold back. So now, the Fiat currency isn‚Äôt practically backed by anything except public trust and complacency, which is what I mean when I say that people have agreed it has value. Now when the government wants to engage in a military conflict or give out more in welfare or start giving out more money for whatever, they don‚Äôt actually have to do anything except print more money, which is causing the same issues as with the Rai stones. This problem of pumping more dollars into the system and reducing the dollar‚Äôs worth is one of the problems Bitcoin seeks to solve. It also seeks to solve the more modern problem of ‚Äúthis is my money and no government should be telling me what to do with it or confiscating it.‚Äù There‚Äôs a finite amount of bitcoins that will ever be produced because there‚Äôs a technological limit built in, and no government is able to artificially regulate it, the free market does.

With Bitcoin, the way it was designed is that the computers on the network essentially use processing power to write down the transactions completed. The first one who does it and gets it verified by the other computers gets a reward for all its hard work in the form of a certain amount of Bitcoins. Initially, the reward was 50 bitcoins. If it stayed that way forever, it would either continue forever and would ruin the stock-to-flow, or it would run out eventually and it would be like a car slamming full speed into a tree. To avoid either, there are built-in ‚Äúhalvings,‚Äù where the amount of reward is reduced by half, so computers would first win 50, then 25 as of 2012, then 12.5 as of 2016, then 6.25, then 3.125 as of earlier this year. The next one is expected in 2028, but they‚Äôre based on the number of blocks added to the chain so it isn‚Äôt a fixed date. This halving essentially does the frog in the water thing where it smooths the transition from creating bitcoins to not. There‚Äôs only ever going to be a fixed number of bitcoins, approximately 21 million of them. This is because of the halvings. The 2028 halving will take us down to 1.56, then 0.78, then 0.39, then 0.19, etc. It creates a mathematical asymptote, where the reward doesn‚Äôt actually touch zero, but it gets so small that it may as well be.",3,2024-11-17 17:10:30,1731885030.0,Bitcoin
1932,1gtmqxr,lxng3j1,"It seems to me that the key difference between Bitcoin and paper money backed by gold is that the amount of paper money that exists is controlled by a central authority who determines how much paper to print and is trusted to keep the appropriate amount of real gold in a vault to cover the paper. The key word is trust. 
Bitcoin is a ledger system to keep track of people‚Äôs promises to each other that has so far proven extremely difficult to crack, fake, and manipulate. It still depends on trust that other people will desire it. Interesting idea.

Just like gold, no one governs or controls it, it‚Äôs people‚Äôs money it‚Äôs what we decide the value to be by sheer demand and a fixed supply, and hence decentralized and all the things I mentioned creates use case and value. Govt can print money and devalue your currency but they cannot devalue or ever increase bitcoins. It will also be 21mil.  Gold other than jewelry never really had a use case but it was consider the best form of commerce due to all the reasons mentioned above but gold was not scalable and hence paper money was invented but govt decide to abuse it and control it. Bitcoin solved the problem of both gold and paper money. Bitcoin is peer to peer and just like gold you can directly sell or buy from anyone without an intermediary. Again All the things mentioned are its feature which  creates its value and use case.  Bitcoin is also the best digital capital asset class. Owning real estate or cars or boats as assets you pay taxes, insurance,  hurricane could wipe it out, I cannot move a home from US to china. My home is governed by city & county rules. Bitcoin is an asset class that is free from this entropy, its movable, its instant, its immutable.

1944,1gtmqxr,lxnexf1,"Fiat survives on debt, therefore there's an arbitrage opportunity, also called the cantillon effect.¬†¬†Debt acts as a gatekeeper in the fiat system, by locking up economic value in a form that can only be unlocked by completing the payment obligations. This ensures that the financial system has a steady stream of obligations that help sustain the flow of currency, which gives fiat currency its value.


Raising interest rates actually works by cutting off this debt, as well as new money supply the debt creates, so people in aggregate can't buy as many goods if debt is more expensive to survice.¬†¬†More debt needs to be created to pay off the old debt, as the new debt creates the extra money supply to pay the interest on the old debt, so people begin to default on their past debt as rates rise, and we usually get a 2008 style recession.


If you attach this ever growing debt accumulation to a recursively scarcer asset that assets supply dries up and gives logarithmic returns.¬† This is what company like MicroStrategy are doing, issuing bonds for that arbitrage, and funneling it into Bitcoin which is getting scarcer over time.


This is what people were doing with housing before the 2008 bubble, funneling debt into housing to derive value, except houses aren't finite so new supply gets built.¬† Housing starts were at an all time high, and then the ponzi scheme ends.¬† Bitcoin has the reverse of this phenomenon, less supply is available over time, and new supply can't be created any quicker.

1967,1gtkwdm,lxn8j79,"So, first off when planning to retire you should think out 30 years or till you're 65. Anything under those two will require hard work and sacrifice if you wish to keep your standard of living. Life shouldn't be this way but it is if you're playing on Normal.

With Bitcoin you should be able to do better than Normal, but there are still some things to consider. Are you in a job that has a 401(K) and an HSA? Do you have a Roth IRA going? Do you make too much to do a Roth IRA? If you want to retire early then you should be maximizing out these retirement buckets, and sacrificing at least 25% of your income to retirement right now. 

Are you completely sold on Bitcoin and look at Bitcoin as the apex asset? You can gear these retirement products towards Bitcoin investments, such as Bitcoin Roth IRAs, investing in ETFs through your HSA, etc.... Maybe you have no control over your 401(k) but maximize your employer match because that right their is an instant 100% ROI then compounded with what is likely much smaller returns than Bitcoin but it is already doubled. 

I got into Bitcoin and crypto back in late 2020. I am literally magnitudes better off now because of that choice, but taking care of debt and understanding investing better is what led up to me being able to really benefit from Bitcoin and crypto. 

It takes time. Compound interest takes time. Bitcoin looks to be the best asset in the world for compound interest. Make sacrifices now so you can enjoy retirement when it comes, and hopefully it will come early for you. 

Last thing, if Bitcoin is going to continue to see high rates of return, even if diminishing slightly on average each year, then at some point you can theoretically own enough Bitcoin where you can sell a portion to continue to live at your current lifestyle and you will never run out of Bitcoin before you die because the value will increase faster than your spending.",16,2024-11-17 14:22:37,1731874957.0,Bitcoin

There are other apps for your phone where you can just use that instead, but yes you‚Äôre correct in understanding that the benefit of the hardware wallet is that you don‚Äôt have to expose the seed that is the key to all your funds on an internet connected device.

You could literally have your hardware device obliterated, and then you could just buy a new one and input your seed on that one and your bitcoin would magically appear and be accessible again.

The way this works is that bitcoin only actually exists on the blockchain, which is a distributed database running on Bitcoin nodes hosted independently all around the world.

You can input your seed to anything that understands how to use a private key to assess your bitcoin and sign transactions for you to broadcast to the Bitcoin network to move your coins to a new address (how Bitcoin is ‚Äòsent‚Äô), but there are risks all over the place with people trying to separate you from your Bitcoin for obvious reasons.

Also I‚Äôm not sure your last question makes much sense. Your hardware wallet can be secured by a pin and other security measures like using the sd card for pin encryption and erasing on too many pin attempts, but you wouldn‚Äôt want to use a cold wallet in addition to a hot wallet with the same seed as that makes your security as weak as the hot wallet.

You can view your balances of a cold wallet on an Internet connected device without too much risk (look into xpubs) but again you‚Äôd never want to use your cold wallet seed on a hot wallet or ever let anyone or anything see it.",1,2024-11-17 11:29:03,1731864543.0,Bitcoin

>safest and easiest

Safest =/= easiest. That's for sure.

We all have been where you're at, read/bookmark this guide and make sure to learn along your journey. 

Congrats on the move, it's never too late. ONLY INVEST MONEY YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE. 

Invest in your knowledge, learn about Bitcoin as much as you can. The Bitcoin Standard book is a must read. So is Broken Money book. Get them and READ them both, please. 

Also, **don't reply any DMs**, emails, private messages on other social media, promising to buy Bitcoin from them or get rich quick and read this short guide, please:

**Price wise, nobody knows what the price will be tomorrow, next week or at the end of the year.** 

**Try ""Bitcoin ONLY"" strategy for at least the first 210,000 block cycle**, you'll sleep much better. Newcomers lose so much money, holding garbage tokens just because someone on YT told them to. If you don't like losing money in [failed coins](https://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/how-many-cryptocurrencies-failed), avoid. 

Going DCA is probably the best approach, IMHO. 
Bitcoin to me, is a savings account. If I have some spare cash, I exchange it for sats. Once a week works best for me, but I'm getting paid weekly. If there's a 10% drop in the price since my last buy, I usually double my buy. This [DCA calculator](https://dca.bitnob.com/) might help to decide what will work best for you. In a few years, even $10 dollars a month can make a massive difference. This [DCA blog](https://er-bybitcoin.com/) is pretty interesting. 

Now, don't buy a fake Bitcoin at a spot ETF place or similar, **get the real thing** that you can withdraw anytime you want. Register at a proper exchange and buy real Bitcoin. Any of these will do [https://bitcoin-only.com/get-bitcoin](https://bitcoin-only.com/get-bitcoin) 

Install (or buy - in case you're getting Bitcoin in Thousands of $) one or more of these wallets.

A few good wallet choices:

[https://blockstream.com/green/](https://blockstream.com/green/) \- Top Security Features, Open Source and Non-Custodial

[https://bluewallet.io](https://bluewallet.io/) \- excellent, easy to use wallet, Open Source and Non-Custodial 

[https://www.sparrowwallet.com](https://www.sparrowwallet.com) - top desktop wallet 

[https://electrum.org](https://electrum.org/) \- Solid choice, Open Source and Non-Custodial, one of the oldest and most trusted Bitcoin Wallets. I prefer the desktop version but it works on mobile too.

Lightning wallets to consider (cheaper and faster transactions, great for small amounts):

[https://phoenix.acinq.co/](https://phoenix.acinq.co/) \- Phoenix - very good wallet, uses Tor for extra privacy, easy for anyone new 

[https://blixtwallet.github.io/](https://blixtwallet.github.io/) \- Blixt - great UI, fast and clean 

[https://breez.technology](https://breez.technology/) \- Breez - excellent POS for small business owners as well as integrated Bitrefill or LN Pizza

[https://zeusln.com/](https://zeusln.com/) Zeus - impressive wallet with many features, can even generate Nostr keys

Hardware Wallets (to store larger amounts):

[Trezor](https://trezor.io/) \- Easy to use, no matter how new in Bitcoin you're. Use the Bitcoin only firmware as it's safer than a multi coin software. 

[ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/) - air gapped, Bitcoin only, has advanced features but a new user will do fine with one of the great tutorials available.

[BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/bitcoin-only/) - another great little device, opt for the more secure Bitcoin ONLY version (less coins = less code = less chance for a hidden bug or a backdoor) 

[Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade) - air gapped, fully open source, Bitcoin only, great features. You can even [build it on your own](https://github.com/Blockstream/jade/), if you feel adventurous. 

[Seedsigner](https://github.com/SeedSigner/seedsigner) - another DIY, fully open source, air gapped, Bitcoin only hardware wallet, not for you if you're just starting up but something to consider later.

[Krux wallet](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/) - one more DIY hardware device, I love this one for many reasons. Similar to Seedsigner, it's fully open source, air gapped, Bitcoin only hardware wallet, that is not for you right now if you're just starting up, but something to consider at a later stage and/or to up the security of your bitcoin. 


There's also Ledger, but I wouldn't recommend it as it's not fully open source, keep and already leaked customers' details, recently said they're capable of sending customers' keys out just with a firmware update, etc. **Stay away**, save yourself a headache in the future. 

Whatever wallet you'll decide to buy, purchase DIRECTLY from the manufacturer, no eBay, no Amazon. 

Make sure the device is NOT preset, and you will generate your own seed words. Write them down on any piece of paper as well as the receiving address. Now wipe the wallet and generate a new wallet. If the seed words are different from the first set, you're safe to use it. 

Find an option to set a passphrase and use it. This will boost the security to another level. Never store the seed words and passphrase together. Use a different medium if possible. If somebody finds both, they'll be able to steal your coin. 

This little device will hold the keys to your money, that's the reason why you have to be a bit more careful. Also, no worries, if it breaks, you can replace it - as long as you keep your seed words and passphrase(s) safe.

Welcome to the rabbit hole and don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions anytime during your Bitcoin journey.

2296,1gtesdu,lxlsbw4,"What I use:

Steps:

\#1 Download Robinhood app.

\#2 Make an account.

\#3 Invest in the stock, ""IBIT"" --> It's the ETF form of Bitcoin. If Bitcoin rises, so does the stock (same if it falls).

Pros:

\- Don't have to get involved with wallets. The stress of transferring it correctly, malware, scammers, etc.

Cons:

\- You are only able to buy and sell during stock trading hours (so 9-4 EST during the week). As a result, you can't take out your money out on the weekend or put money in.

Overall, I'm pretty happy with it. I invested back in July using this stock and after the last surge, I'm up around 10,000,

These latter three parts of gold is 5% of world public debt. Bitcoin market cap is currently at 1.8% of world public debt. I don‚Äôt think bitcoin would replace gold, but it could parallel gold.

Most don't buy big when starting.
When you DCA you would need to have quite some spare money to have put in to reach a million dollar at this moment.

The first buys matter the most but usually it takes a few years for most to put in money that matters.
Next the moment of buying in the four year cycle can make a big difference so that needs to be good as well or you will need another cycle / a few years more.

Not to mention the possible mistakes one can make...

But if you do things right those last cycles make it go fast.
Starting with a $100k will get you to a million if the cycle delivers a ten fold.
And the cycle after that should get you home if you do it right.

1.	‚Å†Bitcoin Whitepaper by Satoshi Nakamoto: If you‚Äôre not a techie, chances are high that you won‚Äôt understand much. Don‚Äôt get discouraged by that. Just try to read it and understand as much as possible. This is the resource that brings you as close as you can get to its origins. From there, continue exploring.
2.	‚Å†The Bitcoin Standard by Saifedean Ammous: An amazing book to get introduced to what money is, basic economic principles of the Austrian School, and how Bitcoin fits into this.
3.	‚Å†Mastering Bitcoin by Andreas Antonopoulos: A great book if you want to understand how the Bitcoin network operates from a technical perspective.

From here, you can dive deeper into the rabbit hole:

‚Ä¢	‚Å†21 Lessons by Gigi
‚Ä¢	‚Å†The Blocksize War by Jonathan Bier: Some history
on BTC
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Saylor Academy by Michael Saylor: Certified online
course
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Layered Money by Nik Bhatia
‚Ä¢	‚Å†The Sovereign Individual by James Dale Davidson
‚Ä¢	‚Å†When Money Dies by Adam Fergusson: A good book to understand what happened in Weimar Germany. A retrospective analysis with an explanation of why fiat money is doomed and ends in hyperinflation.

Now, come back to the original Whitepaper by Satoshi, and you will feel amazing because you actually understand what this person or group understood many years before you.

FASB rules change in December, allowing companies to hold it on their balance sheet. Sovereign wealth funds are here, family offices are here, and pension funds are here. Nation state game theory is starting. All of the major sellers have already sold their coins. Not to mention, trump will put a pro crypto figure in charge of the SEC. The list goes on and on of bullish indicators.

I still expect volatility, but the dips will be fewer and far between and will last much shorter than in previous cycles. Everyone is expecting $100-250k this cycle, and Bitcoin usually does what everyone is least expecting. That's why I think we could grind up to $500k, and it will increase much more violently if the Lummis bill passes.

3464,1gsv3ag,lxlajpk,"That's something you have to calculate for yourself. I think we're going to go to 150k this bull run, and that means it's definitely going to dip below 100k. A 50% drawdown from absolute peak to absolute bottom is normal for BTC. But if you think that we're going past 200k, then I get why you think we won't ever see 5 figures again. I just personally think it's a bit too early for that.

This will be the first cycle where we break 6 figures to begin with, surely it'd be a bit silly to think people aren't going to try and take profits once we get there. I'd even go one step further and say we'll see the 60-70k range again (for a very short period of time, like we hit sub-20k in '22).

Anyway, good luck on your journey. 90k isn't too bad of a price to take a loan out, but just know it could also permanently wreck you financially if you can't pay it back in time. It's not without risks.",1,2024-11-17 07:43:56,1731851036.0,Bitcoin

As the halvings keep getting a little earlier in the year, we may see the cycle top also similarly shift back a little further.

3) If a Fiat currency fails,  banks and Gov will try to reset using Gold as a reset because they hold alot of Gold.

1. Treasury Diversification: Cities like Miami have explored Bitcoin to hedge against inflation and generate revenue. Holding BTC in reserves could protect against fiat currency depreciation.


2. Economic Growth: Bitcoin adoption attracts tech startups and creates jobs. Examples like Wyoming‚Äôs crypto-friendly policies show how cities can position themselves as innovation hubs.


3. Energy & Sustainability: Bitcoin mining can stabilize energy grids and incentivize renewable energy use, as seen in Texas. It‚Äôs an opportunity for green growth and local job creation.


4. Financial Inclusion: Bitcoin provides access to financial services for unbanked populations and offers transparency in government funds.


5. Hedge Against Inflation: With rising national debt and inflation risks, BTC‚Äôs fixed supply offers a unique safeguard for the city‚Äôs financial future.

3651,1gss7ay,lxgsz27,"You are alive during the most pivotal financial revolution in human history. Bitcoin‚Äîthe only truly finite, incorruptible form of money‚Äîis still within reach. But that will not last. This moment, right now, is the equivalent of being alive when land was being claimed, or when the first drops of oil were discovered. Yet, unlike land or oil, Bitcoin is mathematically guaranteed to become scarcer with time, and the world is only beginning to understand its profound value.

200 years from now, your descendants are living in a world where Bitcoin has solidified as the planet‚Äôs ultimate store of value. By then, no new Bitcoin will be mined. Millions will have been permanently lost, and the remaining supply‚Äîperhaps just a few million‚Äîwill serve as the financial bedrock for the entire global economy. What would it mean for your family if they held even a single Bitcoin? What if you, today, had the chance to secure their future empire, and you ignored it?

This is about more than wealth; this is about legacy. The actions you take now could shape your bloodline for centuries. If you accumulate and preserve Bitcoin, you could be the person who sets your family apart for generations, ensuring that your name is remembered in the story of human advancement.

But here‚Äôs the catch: this opportunity demands urgency and discipline. Bitcoin‚Äôs adoption is accelerating. Governments, corporations, and nations are beginning to stake their claim. Every Bitcoin that enters long-term custody is one less available for you. Soon, accumulating even fractions of a Bitcoin will become nearly impossible for the average person.

And when that day comes‚Äîwhen the world fully realizes Bitcoin‚Äôs potential‚Äîyour descendants will ask one question: ‚ÄòDid you act when you had the chance?‚Äô You have the power to ensure your family‚Äôs financial sovereignty in a future that will be defined by scarcity, competition, and a global fight for value.

The time is now. To secure this gift is not just an opportunity‚Äîit is a duty. This is not about indulging in the lifestyle it could afford today. It‚Äôs about preserving it for tomorrow. It‚Äôs about giving your bloodline the foundation to thrive in a world where most will be left behind. Do not let this moment pass. You may hold the key to your family‚Äôs empire for the next 300 years. The question is: will you claim it?",2,2024-11-16 12:10:03,1731780603.0,Bitcoin

* Your Bitcoin keys are stored in multisig cold storage in geographically dispersed locations. This means no single person in no single place can access or move it.
* All Bitcoin held on River is in full reserve, which can you can verify at any time using our [Proof of Reserves](https://blog.river.com/river-proof-of-reserves/).
* Our Bitcoin custody infrastructure is built from the ground up by our team of expert security engineers that ensure the best possible security for your funds.
* Your River account requires the use of mandatory multi-factor authentication (TOTP or SMS), we use strong encryption for passwords, and we have several built in layers of security to protect your account from hackers.
* As Bitcoiners, we always will encourage holding your own keys through self-custody, however, we provide a highly secure option for those who want a simple solution to custody their Bitcoin.

It's because with fiat/paper currency they keep printing it faster and faster making it worth less. They've printed more money in the last 2 years then the first 200 years combined. Because they know this scam is coming to an end and will be replaced with digital currencies.

And unlike paper money that has an infinite supply, Bitcoin has a limited supply making it a deflationary asset. So instead of things becoming more expensive, they actually become seemingly cheaper with Bitcoin as it's value increases. See below:

The domestic payment systems usually only are enabled for the country you're resident in.. so if you open an account saying you're in Thailand then us ach or whatever the local bank transfer options in Hong Kong are may not be enabled for your account even if the platform supports them. You could try asking support to enable it on your account but I have no idea if they will. I'd recommend opening an eur account somewhere in Europe since you're french that probably isn't too difficult. Eur transfers are usually free and many exchanges support them.

4259,1gsixm1,lxk5npf,"I'm from El Salvador and here's my hot take regarding how bitcoin communities will develop: I think it's still too early to tell.   
  
Let me explain: Last month I visited El Zonte after many years (been living abroad). When I was growing up, that place was an absolutely unknown shanty town. Unless you were a surfer who knew the spot, literally nobody went there, despite how absolutely beautiful the scenery is (pictures don't make it justice). 

Went there twice, once during the week and once on the weekend. As a first impression I was pleasantly surprised that, (most) roads have been paved. There's also a lot of private construction going on everywhere and there has been a lot done already. Never in my wildest dreams I thought I'd see a building taller than 2 stories there. There are still some empty plots of land but I was told those are going for 6-7 figures now due to increased demand.

The place is packed but not in a bad way I'd say. It's full of tourists, both foreigners and locals, but everyone just gets along and is super friendly with each other. Even my friends were telling me how they preferred going there instead of other beach towns just because of how chill it is. I appreciate how respectful everyone who has come from abroad is and how they try to integrate into the community. The vibe is incredible. 

And yes, you can pay with bitcoin in most places (I obviously didn't check all of them).

However, you can tell that there is still some level of poverty. Rundown houses where the locals live, kids roaming around aimlessly, street vendors, that sort of thing.  

I think that in 15-20 years, it's going to be a VERY different place, though. I got the feeling that the community is working really hard for the place to develop. I see the potential, it's there for sure, but it's still going to take time. Right now, it feels like a huge science project everyone is taking part in. All in all, cool experience, worth a visit. 

On a side note: Some Salvadorans argue that those type of places are getting too expensive for them, as the general wages in the country have not raised that much yet. I get it. A hostel there a couple of years ago could cost you $40-50 and today they go for $90-100. However, that seems to be a natural consequence of places that see an increase in tourism. 

Feel free to ask stuff you'd like to know.",2,2024-11-17 00:53:04,1731826384.0,Bitcoin

Every investment has risk & every individual has a different tolerance for risk.

You are in the bitcoin subreddit so of course you are going to get a lot of positive responses, but you need to decide for yourself what your own risk tolerance is.

The best thing you can do for yourself is learn more about bitcoin. When I had my ""a-ha"" moment with bitcoin it wasn't because bitcoin price was going up, it was because I understood its role & potential impact on a broken economy. That didn't come quickly. It was after months of going down the rabbit hole on how money & economies work.

My advice, get started now for small amounts & as you learn more, if your conviction grows, continue buying. If you're not convinced, then don't. 

If you're merely buying because ""number go up"" then you are not ready because you'll be the first person to panic sell when it crashes. And it WILL crash.

4541,1gsdd9f,lxduhya,"I don‚Äôt know where you‚Äôre getting your numbers from. From what I see El Salvador did this:

As of July 21, 2022, El Salvador has purchased 2,381 bitcoins at an average price of $43,357 USD.

The country announced that it now owns 5,748.76 BTC in May 2024. El Salvador has stated they accuire BTC through daily purchases and mining.

I couldn‚Äôt exactly find how much BTC they bought between the time periods of July 21, 2022 to May 2024, but I‚Äôm sure they have just continued to buy BTC every day at a flat amount. Let‚Äôs be conservative and estimate their average buying price is $40,000. That would mean at the current price right now, they made a profit of 225% over a 3 year period. That would mean a yearly profit of 75%. That‚Äôs way more of a profit than what the S&P 500 performed at in its best year of 2024 so far. 

It‚Äôs also a success story in the aspect that a portion of the BTC bought was from miners using natural volcanic power. So not only was it‚Äôs buying of Bitcoin a success story, but using natural volcanic power to mine BTC to provide money and power to the country was another example of how this is a success story.

Never joined buttcoin or anything like that, just because I am not the kind of person that would ever go out of my way just to harsh someone else‚Äôs mellow. But I read my little New York Times articles like a good normie and concluded that bitcoin is just a frenzy that is bad for the environment.

But a few things changed my thinking over the years. First inflation. Around 2020 my family and I relocated, sold our house and decided to rent for a year, so we had a TON of cash sitting at just the wrong time when inflation devalued it severely. I tried to protect it best I could by investing in stocks and bonds. Got burnt by bonds bad. Got pretty good at trading stocks just by doing obvious things like putting in limit orders to buy low and sell high. Still don‚Äôt understand why many people do the opposite ü§£. Anyway I got pretty good at noticing patterns. One pattern I noticed is when a new ETF is introduced, the price surges a few months after and then settles down.

So when I read about the bitcoin ETF, I thought to myself that I‚Äôll use this to make a quick buck. But I found the brokerage I was using (vanguard) didn‚Äôt offer the bitcoin ETFs. So I was transferring to a different brokerage (wanted to leave vanguard anyway) but it was taking too long and I thought I was going to lose my opportunity, so I said fuck it, I‚Äôll just buy some bitcoin through PayPal. Once I bought it I figured I‚Äôd learn a bit about it, still for the pure purposes of exploiting it to my quick gain. Learned a ton by being a lurker in this sub and then read some books, broken money is my favorite, and of course listened to some Michael Saylor interviews, and also had fun singing the ‚Äúwe call them poor‚Äù song with my daughter. Anyway I was persuaded by the logical arguments behind bitcoin and now I‚Äôm full on. It‚Äôs so obvious to me that it‚Äôs the future of money.",5,2024-11-15 21:05:19,1731726319.0,Bitcoin

Also at the time Bitcoin was around 300$ and I thought shit I'm way too late, it was less than $1 before, how much more can it grow if it's already $300? Anyway my buddy owed me money and he asked me if I wanted to get paid in Bitcoin. The amount he owed me wasn't much, it was worth about 1/3 of a coin. It was on a website and not on a wallet that I could easily access. I didn't move it to a safe place. Unfortunately the website got shutdown and I was never able to retrieve my 1/3 BTC. I didn't see much growth at the time anyway so I wasn't too upset. I could afford to lose 100$.

The problem is now it's worth close to $40k and I could really use $40k right now... I was reluctant for a long time to buy back in because the prices were astronomically more than when I initially bought in. Another buddy of mine was telling me to buy into Bitcoin again and was telling me that it wasn't too late even at the price of what it was this March. I thought I'd take a leap of faith I bought some this year for around $75k. How much better off would I be now if I bought some as soon as I realized I lost my old one...

5078,1gs41v1,lxbdqlc,"You should buy bitcoin from another person (peer-to-peer) if you want to buy bitcoin without providing KYC.

You can buy bitcoin directly from someone that owns bitcoin and that is willing to sell you some. You can buy bitcoin from someone that you meet at a Bitcoin meetup that is willing to sell you some bitcoin. You can buy bitcoin from a bitcoin seller that advertises on a classified ad website like Craigslist/Gumtree/Facebook Marketplace. Or you can use a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency exchange to easily find someone that is willing to sell you some bitcoin.

[Bisq](https://bisq.network), [RoboSats](https://learn.robosats.com), [Hodl Hodl](https://hodlhodl.com), and [LocalCoinSwap](https://localcoinswap.com) are some of the peer-to-peer cryptocurrency exchanges that make it easy to find someone to buy bitcoin from (peer-to-peer) without providing KYC info.

[Bisq](https://bisq.network) is a decentralized and open source peer-to-peer cryptocurrency exchange that does not request KYC info. Bisq is decentralized, so you have to run the Bisq application on your computer in order to buy or sell bitcoin on Bisq.

[RoboSats](https://learn.robosats.com) is a peer-to-peer bitcoin exchange that does not request KYC info. RoboSats has Lightning Network integration so that you can deposit and withdraw bitcoin over the Lightning Network.

[Hodl Hodl](https://hodlhodl.com) is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency exchange that does not request KYC info. Hodl Hodl has Lightning Network integration.

[LocalCoinSwap](https://localcoinswap.com) is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency exchange that does not request KYC info.

All four of these peer-to-peer cryptocurrency exchanges that I have listed do not require you to provide them any of your personal information in order to buy or sell bitcoin. Many of the bitcoin sellers on these peer-to-peer cryptocurrency exchanges do not request any of your personal information when you buy bitcoin from them. But some of the bitcoin sellers on these peer-to-peer cryptocurrency exchanges do request your name/ID when you buy bitcoin from them because of certain laws/regulations or to help prevent them from getting scammed by fraudsters paying them with stolen accounts.

Many bitcoin ATMs do not request KYC info when you buy less than a certain $ amount worth of bitcoin at a time, but all bitcoin ATMs do have a camera in the front of the machine.",8,2024-11-15 13:38:42,1731699522.0,Bitcoin

5264,1gs01zv,lxcgols,"When you send Bitcoin using a wallet like Blockchain.com, the transaction process involves using your available funds, known as Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs). If the amount you‚Äôre sending is less than your total balance, the wallet sends the specified amount to the recipient and the remaining balance to a newly generated ‚Äúchange address‚Äù within your wallet. This method enhances privacy and security by ensuring that the leftover funds are still under your control but are associated with a different address.

In your case, it sounds like your Blockchain.com wallet generated a change address to hold the remaining 0.799 BTC after sending 0.2 BTC to Binance. Normally, this address should appear in your wallet‚Äôs balance after a brief delay as the wallet synchronises. However, other users have reported occasional issues where the balance may not show up immediately. This appears to be a known, if rare, delay in displaying change addresses in the main balance with Blockchain.com wallets.

The wallet should eventually synchronise and display the correct balance, though this may take some time. As a precaution, you could try refreshing or logging out and back into your wallet.

In previous cases, i‚Äôve observed from other users, the issue eventually resolved itself without intervention from Blockchain.com support. However, if you remain concerned or if the balance doesn‚Äôt appear within a reasonable timeframe, contacting support would be wise. (On those same cases they did not received any reply from support, but they may have improved their support service meanwhile)

In short, if you‚Äôve taken all the correct steps (as it seems), the funds are likely still under your control and will show up once the wallet fully updates.",3,2024-11-15 17:03:00,1731711780.0,Bitcoin

If you don't have a linked bank account then you will only see the option to buy from a card and that will eat you up on fees. Similarly, it is cheaper to do a 'limit buy' at a set price, ideally as a 'maker', meaning you are the one setting the trade offer and someone else matches it.

The reason OP said that is because he does not know what he is talking about.

You should aim for a minimum of 1m sats per **UTXO**.  You should also avoid address reuse, so ideally one UTXO per address.

Limiting yourself to 1m sats per address is meaningless.  If those 1m sats are spread across multiple UTXOs in a single address then you are screwed.",3,2024-11-15 07:59:54,1731679194.0,Bitcoin

5479,1grunlm,lxabxzb,"It‚Äôs an unspent transaction output. Basically every time you create a new receive address and send bitcoin to it a UTXO is ‚Äúdeposited‚Äù into that new address. 

Theoretically you can send multiple times to the same receive address and have multiple UTXOs in a single address but it‚Äôs considered best practice to only send once to every receive you create. Most people will have one UTXO per address. 

It‚Äôs not something to worry about but something to keep track of, if the amount of bitcoin that corresponds to a particular UTXO is less than the fee rate charged by the network it‚Äôs unspendable because it costs more to send than it‚Äôs worth.

This is why every once in a while you should create a new receive and send all the individual transactions you made when you pulled your BTC off whatever exchange you used into a single receive transaction that way you have one address with one big UTXO ensuring it will always be spendable. Say every six months you take all your withdrawal and send them to your own wallet at the end of the year you‚Äôd have 2 (roughly) equally sized UTXOs instead of 12 smaller ones from each of the exchange withdrawals you made.

Mine isn‚Äôt as personal and is kind of funny, really. I was designing game economies for a university assignment (I have a degree in games design, heh) and the more I worked on the design of my mini-economy, I couldn‚Äôt help but draw hasty parallels to broken economies in games and our current reality. It prompted me to study bitcoin out of sheer curiosity to see if it could be used as inspiration for a water proof game economy and well, I went down that rabbit hole and never got out. Bitcoin just made sense to me and Andreas Antonopoulos and Michael Saylor especially explained the more complex concepts in a way that really clicked with me. 

To me Bitcoin is a beautiful system that contains the time and the energy that you pour into it. It‚Äôs the kind of system design I like seeing in games, too.

Bitcoin isn't an investment. Its the hardest form of money we as a species has ever had access to. I have compiled a shortlist of videos to help aid your understanding. The 4th video is the real gem in this list and I'd suggest watching it first. It teaches you key concepts about money. Once these concepts are understood, you can look at Bitcoin & the US dollar and fully understand what makes bitcoin ""money"", and the US dollar (a fiat currency).. and the implications of both.

Start here:

Clip 1: What bitcoin is, the problem it fixes, and why its the solution  
[https://youtu.be/pBmK3pI7uKw?si=n59JkGuJ\_gP\_dEd5](https://youtu.be/pBmK3pI7uKw?si=n59JkGuJ_gP_dEd5)

Clip 3: All Fiat currencies in history have gone to zero, the American Dollar (which is fiat.. meaning has no sound money (like gold or bitcoin) backing it. The gold backing of the dollar ended in 1971 with Nixon, which is when the dollar became fiat currency)

Clip 4: The difference between ""Currency"" & ""Money"".. What is sound money, and why gold (and now bitcoin) fits this description (This series was originally made in 2010, before bitcoin was well known). Feel free to watch all 10 videos in the series in your spare time, but if you do anything, at least watch the 1st vid in the series. (This might be the most important video here)

As well as Broken Money by Lyn Alden. 

Lots of people can give you their talking points about bitcoin. But unless you understand a bit more of how money works, how political entities debase their currencies for short term gain, and why bitcoin is radically different than any other value system in human history, you‚Äôre probably going to be scratching your head at some of these answers.",2,2024-11-15 06:47:53,1731674873.0,Bitcoin

Things like real estates will drop in price because they have been used as a store of value and now they will be priced solely based on utility.

In a world where people no longer need or want to treat real estates as a major store of value assets, we will see a lot less money circulated in the economy which solves the root of inflation.

5743,1grroor,lx8h6ia,"Well, I think easy money can be definitely abused by overprinting it, causing hyperinflation, etc... There are other problems too like Cantillon effect, easy access to money by governments to finance wars etc... That's the dark side of easy money and we all know it very well.

However, all summed, I think fiat currencies were still net beneficial for the society and bad effects were more an exception than a rule. Here's what I can say in defense of easy money:

1) easier access to credit stimulates economic activity and makes life easier for a large amount of people.

2) Fed interventions help smooth and overcome economic crises and recessions

3) Generally we have more stable and predictable prices and less harsh business cycles than during Gold standard

4) Taxes are generally unpopular and disruptive and government needs taxes to finance its activities. Easy money allows for some tax to be collected through inflation, and such hidden tax, for all its insidiousness, still feels more comfortable and more acceptable to people, rather than paying directly out of their pocket. Without inflation, government would need to tax us all harder in order to provide the same level of services.

I think these positive effects have higher weight, because they affect almost everyone.

But yes, you're right, unfortunately, by the very virtue of being ""easy"", such ""easy money"" is likely to be driven out by hard money. But I wouldn't blame Fed for that. They generally have good intention to steer economy in the positive direction and to balance inflation and unemployment in best ways they can. Yes, they make mistakes. But the reason people switch to hard money is not because hard money is a better system... it's simply due to game theory. They simply want to hold whatever performs better on market.

Now regarding who is guilty for the whole mess? I think there are 3 culprits. CBs are ""guilty"" because they created easy money, even though they had the best intentions and very good reasons to do it. They are not guilty in sense of being in the wrong... they are simply guilty because easy money can cause such a mess when it's driven out by the harder money. But I wouldn't blame them at all, because when they created their easy money, things like bitcoin were not possible in the first place, so there was no danger of such money being driven out by something harder. They created the system decades before bitcoin came to be.

The second culprit, and the biggest one, are those who promote bitcoin heavily, without taking into consideration its negative side. Those guys who create hype cycles, youtube videos, podcasts, etc... They are to blame because they have significant effect on increasing the chance of bitcoin success and subsequent negative effects.

Now the third category, the people who simply invest in bitcoin without spreading the propaganda and evangelizing it, are the least guilty. I would not blame them almost at all. They simply want to protect their financial interests and they do the rational thing. We are no angels, people always look to protect their wealth or to increase it, its only natural. Selfish, but perfectly understandable.

But then there's another problem too. Houses losing value isn't too innocent either. If you bought a house paying full monetary premium on it, and then this monetary premium is lost, you still end up losing some wealth.

It seems bitcoin will diminish value of most assets in one way or another, but dollar in particular losing value could reflect in higher prices of stuff, especially food and other products for consumption that don't have monetary premium in the first place.",0,2024-11-15 03:50:21,1731664221.0,Bitcoin
5749,1grroor,lx8kw15,"Yeah, I think you're right generally. Perhaps there's some middle ground between the 2 worlds though?

Like buying some bitcoin to protect yourself in case it succeeds but not buying too much of it, for the gainz? :D

Or perhaps buying it only if you need it. In some countries people have few investment options. It's not everywhere like US, where you have SP500 and index funds and whatnot. If your currency sucks, if it has high inflation and you don't have a better place to put your money in, then by all means buy bitcoin.

But if you're in the US, and have plenty of chance to invest your money in more productive ways, then making bitcoin a large part of your portfolio might not be the most ethical choice.",2,2024-11-15 03:27:43,1731662863.0,Bitcoin

Also people who didn't invest in bitcoin in 2013, missed the opportunity to gain money, but lost almost nothing.

This is because tech shares as well as bitcoin (as of today) still didn't take a significant share of market cap of other currencies.

It's obvious that neither tech shares, nor bitcoin, have yet really made any significant damage to dollar.

But I am talking about future scenario in which bitcoin succeeds and eats a significant portion of the market of other currencies.

Then it will lead to non-coiners **losing money**, and not just missing out potential gains.

Also the difference between stocks and bitcoin is that there are companies behind those stocks and they increase the global GDP. And the bigger the economy, the stronger the dollar and other currencies.

So they make up for the market share they took from dollar, by strengthening the economy and therefore making dollar stronger. So their net effects on dollar are probably zero.

The article ""What You Need To Know Before Buying Your First Bitcoin"" by Andrey Sergeenkov provides essential guidance for new Bitcoin investors, emphasizing security, informed decision-making, and preparation over timing. Key points include:

1. Choosing a Platform:

Regulated Exchanges: Platforms like Coinbase and Binance offer convenience and security but require trust in third parties.

Peer-to-Peer (P2P): Provides privacy but demands technical knowledge and careful counterparty verification.

Bitcoin ATMs: Convenient but expensive due to high fees.



2. Local Regulations:

Bitcoin regulations vary globally. Research local rules and seek guidance from experienced Bitcoin users in your area.



3. Security Practices:

Use strong, unique passwords and two-factor authentication (preferably via an app, not SMS).

Avoid storing large amounts of Bitcoin on exchanges; use hardware wallets for offline storage.

Safeguard recovery phrases and avoid sharing private keys.



4. Scam Awareness:

Be cautious of ""guaranteed returns,"" pressure tactics, unsolicited advisors, and suspicious links.

Never rush into decisions; verify information and consult experts.



5. Managing Volatility:

Bitcoin prices can be highly volatile. Avoid over-investing or using funds needed for immediate expenses.

Focus on long-term understanding rather than reacting to short-term price swings or news.



6. First Month Advice:

Start with small transactions to learn the basics.

Prioritize understanding Bitcoin's technology and security over market movements.

So do you stop using any of the mentioned services and items because of a potential power outage? No?

Besides of that most people don't understand the fact that internet is in these days a civilizational infrastructure like water, waste water channels or electricity. Now we use it for over 30 years and it is literally the backbone of the economy controlling stock exchanges, banking services, supply lines, factories, power stations and so on and so on. 

The internet is not reading Reddit a fact people making complaints about the need of internet don't understand. Another example, in most countries by now landline telephones are based on voice over IP. Guess trough which channel voice over IP is running? No internet no landline. 

To kill Bitcoin you need by now a planetary wide power outage. To get to this point we are either hit by a comet or after a nuclear war. Can it happen, yes. Is it highly likely, no.

If you have a local power outage as soon as it is back with internet you can access your BTC. If you leave the area you can access your BTC. This is the power of a decentralized monetary system. And think about, Reddit is the living proof even people in war zones like Sudan, Yemen, Palestine or Ukraine have internet and electricity. Not all the time but often enough to write here. If you can write here you can send your BTC. With Starlink we have now satellite internet around the globe, Russians and Chinese are installing right now there own version of Starlink. So in the future it would not even matter if local line based internet goes down because we have a space backup.

5948,1grnizc,lx8lpvq,"You're quite right, you currently have something more akin to Schr√∂dinger's cat; you don't really know if there's Bitcoin in the box. 
Going further into that metaphor, like the quantum superposition Schr√∂dinger's cat helps us understand, keeping your bitcoin in superposition is a similarly fragile state, if the lessons learnt by MtGox, FTX, BlockFi, Celsius, QuadrigaCX taught us anything...

Although a custodial wallet would seem like a step up from where you are now, since you can at least view something on-chain, I'd argue it's not much better - the custodians keys may well be compromised already and they just don't know it yet. 

The solution is self-custody in a secure wallet; a wallet created offline and never brought online.

Someone asked a similar question recently so I'll copy what I wrote before and tweak it.

A beginner friendly cold wallet is the Trezor hardware wallet.

Other examples of hardware wallets are BitBox and ColdCard.
Ledger is not an example, since their devices are not designed to be unable to share your private keys with the computer they are attached to - only the devices firmware, which could be hacked, prevents this.

For more substantial amounts of Bitcoin, services from Casa, Liana or Nunchuk might be worth a look.

> How do you set it up?

Order a Trezor from the company directly and follow their official instructions.

Ensure you make a new wallet using the device, not import one you already had on a phone or computer.
The reason for this is this device has two functions: secretly creating a cold bitcoin wallet, and securely signing a bitcoin transaction. You would be skipping that first benefit if you used a wallet that had been created elsewhere.

Next, back the wallet up:
The device has securely created a wallet. However, you should not rely on the device still functioning in 10 years. In the meantime it might suffer fire damage, water damage, be lost or stolen. 
One of the most highly recommended ways to create a backup is using steel, which is more likely to survive fire or flood: https://thebitcoinhole.com/seed-backup.

To protect against loss, I would keep the Trezor and Steel in separate places, or buy more than one steel and keep one in another location.

To protect against theft, you can follow these instructions: 
https://trezor.io/learn/a/passphrases-and-hidden-wallets
Note that doing so will help protect against theft, but you will need to remember this passphrase or lose access to your funds. Personally I think it is ok to keep a passphrase in a password manager, since it is useless without your private key (never store your private key in a password manager).
In case your password manager account is something you could lose access to in that time, keep this passphrase somewhere else too (safe from fire and flood; so, potentially in the cloud). Make sure never to store your wallet backup in the cloud.
Pro's: protection from theft; if someone finds your crypto steel it is useless to them.
Con's: complexity.

> How do you pay into it?

https://trezor.io/learn/a/receive-crypto-in-trezor-suite

> How do you sell Bitcoin once it's in there? (After > 10 years ofc)

https://trezor.io/learn/a/send-crypto-in-trezor-suite
However, if the device isn't working, buy a new hardware wallet and use your backup along with, if you set one, your passphrase, to import your wallet and then follow the instructions of that device.

I would also write down instructions for your future self.

I would also recommend making small test transactions; sending and receiving. 
I would also recommend practicing restoring a backup, and practicing again after months/years.
I would also recommend not putting this off.

I intentionally stuck with how to do this with Trezor because you asked, ELI5, and I think their product and help documentation is most appropriate in that case.",1,2024-11-15 03:36:27,1731663387.0,Bitcoin

6004,1grmuko,lx7d13a,"Hey, sorry to hear the recent price action has you feeling anxious. It has happened to all of us at some point, whether we admit it or not. Well, *maybe* not to Michael Saylor, that guy seems stone cold convicted. At least for me, each cycle has been easier to block out the noise, so I think it does get better with time.

General advice is to not talk about how much you have, but since you did, I'll run you through how I think about volatility as an individual with your numbers. 3.2 BTC at 90k ea means that you're roughly 288k committed. Now I don't know what kind of money that was, but there are three scenarios (there are truly more, but let's bucket them grossly):

1. That is retirement money that you can't touch for a long time anyway, so yolo.
2. That is chump change, so it doesn't really matter if it goes to zero (I doubt this is the case given your post).
3. You are overcommitted, and you really can't afford to lose that much money.

So let's pull it apart. If scenario 1, are you nervous that you might fuck up your future cashflow when you're old? Well then you're probably also in bucket 3, so go there. Otherwise, plan on checking in after a decade to see how it's doing and keep trucking no matter what is happening in the news. If you're too close to retirement to do that, you're definitely in bucket 3.

If scenario 2, congrats on having so much liquidity in a fuck-it-bucket.

If scenario 3, I strongly urge you to think about your risk tolerance and what amount of money would allow you to sleep at night. Looks like the current AUD price is roughly 136k, so a tidy profit over your entry. Consider taking a little profit, counting yourself lucky on your timing, and right-sizing your position.

Good luck. My opinion: we are just getting started this cycle, and faces will be melted. Will yours be one of them?",7,2024-11-14 21:31:29,1731641489.0,Bitcoin

(btw, the worlds total wealth split evenly for everyone on earth would represent $60,975 USD per human on earth today... so you have  about $94M of that... potential). That's more important than what BTC represents in AUD (a made up fiat, that will continue to become worth less over time, meaning the made up number you convert BTC to in your head will only go up over time).

But back to the point... to really be orange pilled, you need to reframe your mind. BTC is worth BTC... you have a lot of it. You don't want to sell it, and for the love of God you don't want to convert it back to AUD... that would be foolish.

Second, many have said this on here, but if you can‚Äôt sleep over it, you are over exposed!

Third, come up with your plan. That will make you feel more settled. If you mostly bought around 50k you‚Äôll be doubling your money soon. So you should choose your markers now and write them down so you won‚Äôt shake from them. It will also calm you down (I hope) cause you‚Äôll have a closer goal, not some vague idea of just getting rich. Sell 20% when you‚Äôve doubled. Sell another 30% when we hit 150, 30% at 175, or whatever.  
Just choose your numbers and stick to them. Because if you hold this until this time next year and you‚Äôre down 40-50% and you didn‚Äôt take out a dime‚Ä¶ trust me, that‚Äôs when you REALLY won‚Äôt sleep‚Ä¶

Congrats on the move, it's never too late. ONLY INVEST MONEY YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE. 

Invest in your knowledge, learn about Bitcoin as much as you can. The Bitcoin Standard book is a must read. So is Broken Money book. Get them and READ them both, please. 

Also, **don't reply any DMs**, emails, private messages on other social media, promising to buy Bitcoin from them or get rich quick and read this short guide, please:

**Price wise, nobody knows what the price will be tomorrow, next week or at the end of the year.** 

**Try ""Bitcoin ONLY"" strategy for at least the first 210,000 block cycle**, you'll sleep much better. Newcomers lose so much money, holding garbage tokens just because someone on YT told them to. If you don't like losing money in [failed coins](https://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/how-many-cryptocurrencies-failed), avoid. 

Going DCA is probably the best approach, IMHO. 
Bitcoin to me, is a savings account. If I have some spare cash, I exchange it for sats. Once a week works best for me, but I'm getting paid weekly. If there's a 10% drop in the price since my last buy, I usually double my buy. This [DCA calculator](https://dca.bitnob.com/) might help to decide what will work best for you. In a few years, even $10 dollars a month can make a massive difference. This [DCA blog](https://er-bybitcoin.com/) is pretty interesting. 

Now, don't buy a fake Bitcoin at a spot ETF place or similar, **get the real thing** that you can withdraw anytime you want. Register at a proper exchange and buy real Bitcoin. Any of these will do [https://bitcoin-only.com/get-bitcoin](https://bitcoin-only.com/get-bitcoin) 

Install (or buy - in case you're getting Bitcoin in Thousands of $) one or more of these wallets.

A few good wallet choices:

[https://blockstream.com/green/](https://blockstream.com/green/) \- Top Security Features, Open Source and Non-Custodial

[https://bluewallet.io](https://bluewallet.io/) \- excellent, easy to use wallet, Open Source and Non-Custodial 

[https://www.sparrowwallet.com](https://www.sparrowwallet.com) - top desktop wallet 

[https://electrum.org](https://electrum.org/) \- Solid choice, Open Source and Non-Custodial, one of the oldest and most trusted Bitcoin Wallets. I prefer the desktop version but it works on mobile too.

Lightning wallets to consider (cheaper and faster transactions, great for small amounts):

[https://phoenix.acinq.co/](https://phoenix.acinq.co/) \- Phoenix - very good wallet, uses Tor for extra privacy, easy for anyone new 

[https://blixtwallet.github.io/](https://blixtwallet.github.io/) \- Blixt - great UI, fast and clean 

[https://breez.technology](https://breez.technology/) \- Breez - excellent POS for small business owners as well as integrated Bitrefill or LN Pizza

[https://zeusln.com/](https://zeusln.com/) Zeus - impressive wallet with many features, can even generate Nostr keys

Hardware Wallets (to store larger amounts):

[Trezor](https://trezor.io/) \- Easy to use, no matter how new in Bitcoin you're. Use the Bitcoin only firmware as it's safer than a multi coin software. 

[ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/) - air gapped, Bitcoin only, has advanced features but a new user will do fine with one of the great tutorials available.

[BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/bitcoin-only/) - another great little device, opt for the more secure Bitcoin ONLY version (less coins = less code = less chance for a hidden bug or a backdoor) 

[Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade) - air gapped, fully open source, Bitcoin only, great features. You can even [build it on your own](https://github.com/Blockstream/jade/), if you feel adventurous. 

[Seedsigner](https://github.com/SeedSigner/seedsigner) - another DIY, fully open source, air gapped, Bitcoin only hardware wallet, not for you if you're just starting up but something to consider later.

[Krux wallet](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/) - one more DIY hardware device, I love this one for many reasons. Similar to Seedsigner, it's fully open source, air gapped, Bitcoin only hardware wallet, that is not for you right now if you're just starting up, but something to consider at a later stage and/or to up the security of your bitcoin. 


There's also Ledger, but I wouldn't recommend it as it's not fully open source, keep and already leaked customers' details, recently said they're capable of sending customers' keys out just with a firmware update, etc. **Stay away**, save yourself a headache in the future. 

Whatever wallet you'll decide to buy, purchase DIRECTLY from the manufacturer, no eBay, no Amazon. 

Make sure the device is NOT preset, and you will generate your own seed words. Write them down on any piece of paper as well as the receiving address. Now wipe the wallet and generate a new wallet. If the seed words are different from the first set, you're safe to use it. 

Find an option to set a passphrase and use it. This will boost the security to another level. Never store the seed words and passphrase together. Use a different medium if possible. If somebody finds both, they'll be able to steal your coin. 

This little device will hold the keys to your money, that's the reason why you have to be a bit more careful. Also, no worries, if it breaks, you can replace it - as long as you keep your seed words and passphrase(s) safe.

6023,1grmc9o,lx7b15h,"This is my 7 step investment plan:  
  
Step 1 of your investment plan should be to educate yourself about bitcoin by reading a few books on it and understand what money is. My first recommendation is The Bitcoin Standard by Saifedean Ammous.  If you're feeling FOMO start with $10 per month while you are learning about it. 
  
Step 2: Once you've realized bitcoin is the hardest money ever created, you'll understand why selling it for a weaker money makes no sense, and you begin researching how to properly secure btc in your own possession where you have complete control over it. I recommend a bitcoin only, \*open source\* hardware wallet like bitbox, seedsigner, or cold card.  
  
Step 3: Once you've determined how to secure it, you look around for the best exchanges - I recommend Swan, Strike, or River  
  
Step 4: Decide how you will begin accumulating btc, either DCA or lump sum purchases. That's up to you, your risk tolerance, and your time horizon (10+ years vs 5-7 years). Immediately move the coins to your hardware wallet.  
  
Step 5: Realize that the bitcoin you're buying is KYC, meaning the exchange and/or government can track your transactions and associate them to your identify, or the data associated with your transactions and can open you up to malicious actors in the future, so you look into how to increase privacy and acquire bitcoin anonymously. Set up your own node and connect your wallet to it for significantly increased privacy and simultaneously make the network more secure, and begin buying anonymously on platforms like robosats or bisq  
  
Step 6: Start learning about coin joins, UTXOs, and coin control to further increase privacy and security around your bitcoin.  
  
Step 7: Become a Bitcoiner who has decided to leave the corrupt financial system of fiat by continually stacking sats, running a node, and educating yourself and others.",1,2024-11-14 21:19:42,1731640782.0,Bitcoin

Congrats on the move, it's never too late. ONLY INVEST MONEY YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE. 

Invest in your knowledge, learn about Bitcoin as much as you can. The Bitcoin Standard book is a must read. So is Broken Money book. Get them and READ them both, please. 

Also, **don't reply any DMs**, emails, private messages on other social media, promising to buy Bitcoin from them or get rich quick and read this short guide, please:

**Price wise, nobody knows what the price will be tomorrow, next week or at the end of the year.** 

**Try ""Bitcoin ONLY"" strategy for at least the first 210,000 block cycle**, you'll sleep much better. Newcomers lose so much money, holding garbage tokens just because someone on YT told them to. If you don't like losing money in [failed coins](https://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/how-many-cryptocurrencies-failed), avoid. 

Going DCA is probably the best approach, IMHO. 
Bitcoin to me, is a savings account. If I have some spare cash, I exchange it for sats. Once a week works best for me, but I'm getting paid weekly. If there's a 10% drop in the price since my last buy, I usually double my buy. This [DCA calculator](https://dca.bitnob.com/) might help to decide what will work best for you. In a few years, even $10 dollars a month can make a massive difference. This [DCA blog](https://er-bybitcoin.com/) is pretty interesting. 

Now, don't buy a fake Bitcoin at a spot ETF place or similar, **get the real thing** that you can withdraw anytime you want. Register at a proper exchange and buy real Bitcoin. Any of these will do [https://bitcoin-only.com/get-bitcoin](https://bitcoin-only.com/get-bitcoin) 

Install (or buy - in case you're getting Bitcoin in Thousands of $) one or more of these wallets.

A few good wallet choices:

[https://blockstream.com/green/](https://blockstream.com/green/) \- Top Security Features, Open Source and Non-Custodial

[https://bluewallet.io](https://bluewallet.io/) \- excellent, easy to use wallet, Open Source and Non-Custodial 

[https://www.sparrowwallet.com](https://www.sparrowwallet.com) - top desktop wallet 

[https://electrum.org](https://electrum.org/) \- Solid choice, Open Source and Non-Custodial, one of the oldest and most trusted Bitcoin Wallets. I prefer the desktop version but it works on mobile too.

Lightning wallets to consider (cheaper and faster transactions, great for small amounts):

[https://phoenix.acinq.co/](https://phoenix.acinq.co/) \- Phoenix - very good wallet, uses Tor for extra privacy, easy for anyone new 

[https://blixtwallet.github.io/](https://blixtwallet.github.io/) \- Blixt - great UI, fast and clean 

[https://breez.technology](https://breez.technology/) \- Breez - excellent POS for small business owners as well as integrated Bitrefill or LN Pizza

[https://zeusln.com/](https://zeusln.com/) Zeus - impressive wallet with many features, can even generate Nostr keys

Hardware Wallets (to store larger amounts):

[Trezor](https://trezor.io/) \- Easy to use, no matter how new in Bitcoin you're. Use the Bitcoin only firmware as it's safer than a multi coin software. 

[ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/) - air gapped, Bitcoin only, has advanced features but a new user will do fine with one of the great tutorials available.

[BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/bitcoin-only/) - another great little device, opt for the more secure Bitcoin ONLY version (less coins = less code = less chance for a hidden bug or a backdoor) 

[Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade) - air gapped, fully open source, Bitcoin only, great features. You can even [build it on your own](https://github.com/Blockstream/jade/), if you feel adventurous. 

[Seedsigner](https://github.com/SeedSigner/seedsigner) - another DIY, fully open source, air gapped, Bitcoin only hardware wallet, not for you if you're just starting up but something to consider later.

[Krux wallet](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/) - one more DIY hardware device, I love this one for many reasons. Similar to Seedsigner, it's fully open source, air gapped, Bitcoin only hardware wallet, that is not for you right now if you're just starting up, but something to consider at a later stage and/or to up the security of your bitcoin. 


There's also Ledger, but I wouldn't recommend it as it's not fully open source, keep and already leaked customers' details, recently said they're capable of sending customers' keys out just with a firmware update, etc. **Stay away**, save yourself a headache in the future. 

Whatever wallet you'll decide to buy, purchase DIRECTLY from the manufacturer, no eBay, no Amazon. 

Make sure the device is NOT preset, and you will generate your own seed words. Write them down on any piece of paper as well as the receiving address. Now wipe the wallet and generate a new wallet. If the seed words are different from the first set, you're safe to use it. 

Find an option to set a passphrase and use it. This will boost the security to another level. Never store the seed words and passphrase together. Use a different medium if possible. If somebody finds both, they'll be able to steal your coin. 

This little device will hold the keys to your money, that's the reason why you have to be a bit more careful. Also, no worries, if it breaks, you can replace it - as long as you keep your seed words and passphrase(s) safe.

No one in the world, even the inventor of Bitcoin would have held it until today. There is no way a human can do that.

All the people out on the internet telling to HOLD, even they have sold their bitcoins at 10x or 20x profits.

Suppose you buy 100 bitcoin at $100.  That is $10,000. You are now gambling your $10,000, which is okay because you are fine with losing that money.  But when the price hits $1000, you are now holding $100,000.  You are now gambling $100,000 and not $10,000.  Psychologically, you would exit here.

1. you live in a first-world country and your income is in EUR or USD. Then, you just DCA a fixed amoung of your income into BTC. When it goes up, fine, your savings rise in value. When it goes down, also fine, you get more BTC for your USD.

2. you live in a high-inflation country and the local currency is worth less than toilet paper. You don't have a reliable income, but some small business. You set up a lightning wallet and tell your customers to pay you in Satoshis, because in Satoshis, the prices of your products tend to go down slowly, instead of up quickly.

Ignore this downturn because if you do, you will survive to see real gains just after the next halving. If you are smart you will hold because not too far in the future (10 years? next bull?sooner?) it will be common to take out crypto loans. You will have acquired capital that you can use to take out loans: for fiat, for more BTC, for whatever. When that happens, you will be in a privileged no matter how much BTC you have.

6172,1grjktg,lx7uqxd,"When I first heard about Bitcoin,  my business partner told me about it in 2010.  He prefaced his explanation  with ""I probably should not be telling you about this technology because you will quit and go off and start working on this stuff.""     He was right,  once he told me about it I started learning everything I could about it.  I read almost every post on Bitcointalk.       

I jumped on IRC and started chatting with everybody and felt like a revolution had just started.   I met with my two business partners and said ""Im out, you can have my shares in the company as long as you sign this affidavit that I am not on the hook for any unpaid taxes"".    I then went to my wife and said, we need to go all in on this.  I maxed all of my credit cards out ($7k) and bought a bunch of GPU's and computers and started mining in my parents basement.  The house was running 80 degrees in the winter and we had all the windows open.   $900 a month power bill.   

I then  went to a friend running a data center an pitched them about mining bitcoin.  I explained how for $100K we could launch a 51% attack on the network and make alot of money hording transaction fee's.    They wanted me to work at their data center to help with their VOIP product line and help with their edge and core routers (MLXE's).   They were only willing to put in $10K and gave me all the free power I wanted and could use as long as I worked as an employee for them.   I was only able to corner 30% of all the hash rate with $17K worth of GPU's and the hash rate exponentially got harder every day until I was having to mine on a pool.    I was the first large scale Bitcoin miner using GPU's, but within months everybody was mining with GPU's and the 51% attack was nearly impossible to pull off.

Lost all the bitcoin to Butterfly labs, hacked on mtgox, and liberty reserve stole a bunch of cashed out money from me.   And lost some in a boating accident.   Gave a few hundred to Jeff Garzik who's pooled mining thing didnt really work out.  Long story short, don't mine bitcoin just buy them and never sell them until you really need them.",0,2024-11-14 23:28:26,1731648506.0,Bitcoin

Just as Bitcoin‚Äôs proof-of-work serves as a gate to ensure that only valid blocks are added to the blockchain (and thus, the system remains secure and trustworthy), the mortgage acts as a gatekeeper in the fiat system by locking up economic value in a form that can only be unlocked by completing the payment obligations.

That's not correct.  Other than the small(ish) fee the ETF takes (which you can view as being similar to fees an exchange will take), BTC and ETFs will perform exactly the same.  If you can hold the ETF in a tax-advantaged account you are actually even better off with an ETF.

> I keep hearing if it's not in your direct possession then it is not your money.

This IS correct.  For example, you can't withdraw BTC from your ETF.  Nor can you sell your ETF on weekends/holidays.  If you hold your BTC you can do whatever with it whenever you like.

Basically, there are pros and cons to both.  Owning both (like you are doing) isn't necessarily a bad idea.  Personally, the bulk of my ownership is in BTC but I have some exposure through ETFs as well.",3,2024-11-14 16:48:26,1731624506.0,Bitcoin
6335,1grh6i8,lx5yhf1,"Yeah as you say, it‚Äôs not actually owned by you, but the ETF provider/broker. If there‚Äôs a Bitcoin rush one day and these orgs get corrupt and start charging for withdrawal or freezing holdings or confiscation happens, you can‚Äôt do anything.

Depending on how much you have, you might want to just leave it there, and just make all your future purchases to self custody. There‚Äôs always the risk you lose your keys etc too. So both have risks.
My preference is self-custody, but do your research first. A lot. 
And welcome to bitcoin!! Stay humble and stack sats",2,2024-11-14 16:47:59,1731624479.0,Bitcoin
6336,1grh6i8,lx69v33,"Whilst everything you are saying is true - the same risk arguably exists for ALL ETFs regardless of the asset backing them.

ETFs are issued by regulated market participants like Blackrock - who are legally obligated as fiduciaries to do what they promise in issuing shares in the ETF - in the case of Bitcoin, buying and holding the underlying coin. 

In the very unlikely event that the ETF provider goes bust or the ETF is closed down, participants in the fund have direct call on the underlying assets - in this case the actual BTC. (And for some ETFs they offer the opportunity for holders to ""cash out"" their BTC to a wallet - I suspect this still counts as a transaction for capital gains purposes as the beneficial ownership changes - get advice on this if you are considering it!)

Anyway, the theoretical risk here of holding through the ETF is that Blackrock sell shares in an ETF for a pool of 1,000 BTC - but they don't actually HOLD 1,000 BTC... they hold less BTC.

However - being a regulated ETF provider this would be a breach of their fiduciary obligations and is not something they would risk. (They are better off being the custodians and making their money off transaction fees).

I would suggest that the exact same ETF provider risk applies if you were holding shares in say an S&P500 index fund ETF. 

If BlackRock or whoever decided to take your money for the S&P500 ETF but actually buy less shares than they promised - or ""freeze"" the fund for some reason - you'd be equally at risk of losing your money. 

I don't think anyone would suggest that buying an S&P500 index fund ETF through a company like Blackrock carries a risk of the ETF provider doing dodgy stuff and/or running off with the money. And I would argue the same is true of the BTC ETFs.

Big funds might manipulate the price through ""shorting"" and other shenanigans - however they can't (legally!) avoid their obligation under the terms of the ETF to hold actual BTC that backs the fund.

I may of course be wrong! And I think in that scenario it would be more than just the BTC ETF affected.

TLDR; Bitcoin held in an ETF is fine and should track the actual price very closely. Fees are roughly on par with setting up a cold wallet and buying BTC through an exchange - and possibly even cheaper until you have a decent-sized stack.

I totally agree that legally one should be protected. I‚Äôm really just talking about a severe future where there is a race around the world to hold the strongest asset, Bitcoin. The US once demanded everyone gives in their gold for paper, and then raised the value of gold after they got it.
We can‚Äôt rule out them, in a future where they want to own all and control all bitcoin, taking the underlying bitcoin and just giving CBDCs or paper instead.

There has been talk about opening up investment to non-government securities since SS was founded in the 1930s. It has cropped up several times, most recently in the early 2000s.  

A big concern has been that equity investment could give government inappropriate control over the private sector, and that this control could be used to meet political goals. What if the US government had a majority shareholder interest in Apple, or GM, or Meta? To conservatives this smacks of socialism. 

BUT, bitcoin is different. It obviates these concerns because bitcoin is a decentralized asset. Nobody owns or controls it, no matter how much bitcoin they amass. 

So, that would make crypto a unique choice vs private equities.

6984,1gr7y0a,lx5nbeb,"So I consider myself reasonably well-educated on economic issues, and I've been involved in Bitcoin since late 2010 with the Wikileaks donations. I participated heavily in the Iowa causes in both of Ron Paul's campaigns because I wanted to see an end to the Federal Reserve. I also mined Bitcoin continually over a decade ago (and off and on with various mining enterprises since then, most notably in 2017). I've also read the article on hyperbitcoinization and generally agree with it, at least in concept. In practice, I don't think the Lightning network has seen the kinds of adoption rates needed for it to work.

I don't know if I understand right now why there is this sudden push for adding to a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve (BSR) or setting up individual state BSRs. I mean, I get the idea, and I agree it could be done with existing coin that is in the hands of agencies. It's the adding more Bitcoin to it part that I don't get. With the likelihood of the GOP controlling two branches and a Department of Government Efficiency, doesn't this mean they plan to cut costs and thus reduce federal spending? If so, these are changes that will strengthen the dollar, not weaken it, and eventually bringing debt under control should reduce the need for Bitcoin as a store of value asset among the populace. If the dollar strengthens and federal spending is under control, everyone will win domestically without having to add more to a BSR.

While I'd be happy to see the price increase, I don't think that Bitcoin should rise in value at the expense of the public as a whole, and I'm worried that adding more to a BSR sends the wrong signals, especially to DC, that it's just business as usual and it's okay to keep monetary inflation and federal spending going hog wild.

Alternatively, **what would be particularly troublesome would be if both spending is drastically cut and we are putting the nation's wealth into a strategic Bitcoin reserve rather than just paying the debt off, as this could lead to bad monetary policy and potentially high unemployment**. These effects on the dollar would be negative domestically, and much of the nation's unbanked and uneducated would be hurt the most by this as they don't have reliable ways to invest in Bitcoin.

Milton Friedman once chastised the Federal Reserve for contributing even more towards the Great Depression as they increased interest rates drastically, forced bank holidays, and generally took the wrong steps towards solving the actual problems that arose after the roaring twenties. It took them 70 years, but Ben Bernanke finally apologized to Milton Friedman on behalf of the Federal Reserve for this bad policy back in 2002.

I'm a little worried this is a case of history repeating itself. It might even get as bad as Executive Order 6102 was, where the Roosevelt administration effectively banned private ownership of gold in a misguided attempt to cull commodities speculation in response to the failing bank closures. We don't want this same thing happening with Bitcoin, where only national reserves can hold crypto, right? Then why aren't we advocating for a sound fiscal policy? Cut costs or only add to a BSR during years when you run a significant deficit. If you're planning on cutting costs, wait a while before actually increasing Bitcoin holdings, don't one-two punch the economy in the gut by also adding to a BSR.

Anyway, the **TL;DR** of this is that **a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve is fine as long as we're only adding what is already in agency hands to it and we're cutting federal spending. If we both cut federal spending AND add to a BSR, I don't see that heading anywhere but to a depression.** If every US state starts adding to a BSR, that could be particularly troublesome, especially if it becomes a race. This would be more than just hyperbitcoinization, it would be depression for the vast majority of the Western world.",17,2024-11-14 15:50:21,1731621021.0,Bitcoin

You're also supposed to report and pay taxes on any capital gains if you buy something with gold. It's one of the things that makes broad-based, legitimate use of bitcoin (or gold, anything other than fiat) as money a problem. The law has exceptions for small transactions in foreign currencies, otherwise you'd be required to track gains from buying a stick of gum while vacationing in Europe.

KYC on non-custodial wallets is not directly feasible, because wallets are just software. You can literally write your own wallet program. This is why the cryptoanarchists won the fight in the 90's when the goverment basically wanted encryption banned.

They could try things like requiring financial institutions to follow a government whitelist of addresses and you get your address on the whitelist by reporting it and doing KYC.

The point of controlling your own keys is not taxation. The government already has systems to watch for and punish tax evasion regardless of what asset is involved. You're already at risk if you have large gains and don't pay your taxes. A more pertinent reason to control your own keys is so that you simply aren't subject to anyone's permission to access your own asset, for whatever that is worth. It could matter not just for things like MtGox/FTX/etc. collapses, but also those emails where your account gets locked for no discernible reason and customer service won't respond usefully.",1,2024-11-14 10:22:45,1731601365.0,Bitcoin

Selling, paying, or trading for altcoins is reportable. Buying with fiat and holding is not. Other places may have their own guidelines.

7117,1gr5qp7,lx4smmr,"I‚Äôve been traditionally educated and worked in finance. Hence also surrounded by people who think the same. There is a lot of noise to block out before you can get there.

To me, Michael Saylor has been able to articulate clearest the rationale for investing in Bitcoin to someone traditionally educated like me.

But I‚Äôve come to realise successful Bitcoin investment is all about mindset. You actually need the will to ignore naysayers and constantly being told you‚Äôre making a stupid decision. You eventually stop talking to friends and family about money. You need to learn to have a long time horizon on decisions. If you can‚Äôt emotionally deal with that, then it will be a challenge to retain your Bitcoin until it makes gains. 

I‚Äôd also like to challenge your points:
1) volatility is only one part of risk. If you‚Äôre investing long term it doesn‚Äôt matter. Over 16 years Bitcoin has only gone up and anyone who invested for longer than 4 years has made money. But as I said above, people can‚Äôt handle the emotional side of bitcoin and never get there. There‚Äôs so many ways in which Bitcoin is less risky than other assets - it is a global asset with a 24/7 market making it extremely liquid and it is not subject to one country‚Äôs regulations. 
2) stocks are also intangible assets. Theyre a promise of a portion of a company that you can‚Äôt touch or feel. It‚Äôs simply that there‚Äôs a track record of dealing with shares. If you‚Äôre very uncomfortable dealing with crypto exchanges or self custody then you should look into a Bitcoin ETF.
3) Warren buffet actually made most of his money off Apple. Yes he is a brilliant investor but you dig down and it‚Äôs one or two star investments which have catapulted him to success.

Before trying any of this, I'd suggest you look into YouTube videos that will help you out understanding how wallets work.¬†",3,2024-11-14 07:46:05,1731591965.0,Bitcoin
7163,1gr4vr8,lx33e78,"Cold wallet is like a web browser. It offers a (convenient and secure) *view* into your funds. The coins themselves reside in the cloud (aka. ""blockchain"") like a web page content (to continue using this analogy).

The ""wallet"" (this name, as you can see, is a misnomer but we're stuck with it for historical reasons) also offers a safe and convenient way to tell the cloud to move your money (send and receive funds).

The main reason for them is that they are a *physically* separate device from your computer and constructed in such a way that its electronics makes it impossible to get your private key, even if your computer has been hijacked by a virus. (There is one notorious exception to this: the Ledger wallet - avoid!)

So basically, just like you could in theory surf the web by laboriously telneting to servers and typing GET commands but nobody sane does it that way, one uses web browsers and clicking instead. Wallets are similar, instead of typing the blockchain commands by hand, you connect a device that does it smoothly and securely for you.",2,2024-11-14 07:48:00,1731592080.0,Bitcoin
7164,1gr4vr8,lx59xrh,"1, A cold wallet just means it is offline, i.e. not connected to the internet. 
2, A wallet contains lots of pairs of numbers. 
3, Each pair of numbers is made up of a public address and a private address.
4, Anybody can transfer bitcoins to a public address. You make this public address available to people.
5, You can look at the contents of any public address in many websites, such as www.bitref.com
6, You never keep your private address online.",1,2024-11-14 14:42:09,1731616929.0,Bitcoin

On November 14, 2021, the Bitcoin network underwent one of its most significant upgrades with the activation of Taproot at block 709,632.¬†This marked the culmination of a long-anticipated improvement to the network‚Äôs capabilities, focusing on enhancing privacy, scalability, and security.

Taproot was first proposed by Bitcoin Core developer Greg Maxwell in 2018 and was later codified through three Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) authored by Pieter Wuille, Tim Ruffing, A.J.¬†Townes, and Jonas Nick.¬†The upgrade was a melting pot of various technical innovations, consolidating years of research and development into a single, comprehensive update.

The core of the Taproot upgrade is the introduction of Schnorr signatures, which replace the ECDSA scheme previously used for digital signatures in Bitcoin transactions. Schnorr signatures are not only smaller and faster than ECDSA signatures but also possess the property of linearity.¬†This feature allows for more complex smart contracts and multi-signature transactions to appear as standard, single-signature transactions on the blockchain, significantly improving privacy.

Moreover, Taproot enables more lightweight and intricate smart contracts, which can be executed with greater efficiency and less data usage.¬†This has positive implications for various projects across the Bitcoin ecosystem, particularly for multi-signature transactions, which will become cheaper and more private.

The upgrade was widely supported by the community, with over 90% of miners signaling their support by June 2021.¬†A programmed waiting period between the lock-in and activation gave node operators and miners ample time to upgrade to the latest version of Bitcoin Core, 21.1, which contains the merged code for Taproot.",21,2024-11-14 07:31:16,1731591076.0,Bitcoin

No CEO or company controls Bitcoin‚Äîit's open-source software, maintained by developers worldwide.

Developers propose changes using Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs). These proposals are discussed openly.

For an upgrade to happen, miners and node operators (computers running the Bitcoin software) need to agree. They do this by updating their software.

If enough of them (usually around 95%) support a change, it‚Äôs implemented.

> DALLAS, Nov. 14, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Solidion Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ: STI), an advanced battery materials provider, today announced a major step forward in its corporate treasury strategy by allocating a significant portion of its excess cash reserves to Bitcoin. This move, alongside the broader pro-Bitcoin environment influenced by the recent election of a pro-crypto administration, solidifies the company's long-term belief in Bitcoin's role as a store of value and a strategic asset. Solidion's core business continues to be developing and commercializing high-capacity silicon anode materials, featuring non-silane gas based and graphene-enhanced versions for automakers and other energy storage applications, along with leveraging other advanced battery technology in our unmatched 550+ patent portfolio.

3. Yes. It‚Äôs common to put a bit of decoy stack in the single sig, so that if you‚Äôre held at gun point you hand that in, while it is also part of the multisig. Make sure you have copies of each seed though. It can get complicated if you‚Äôre not careful and meticulous. 

The only part I have reservations with is the last part. That‚Äôs crazy complicated and also it defies the logic of self custody namely trust no one but yourself.

7436,1gr19oq,lx2sslx,"I can‚Äôt speak necessarily to how you‚Äôd go about doing this with bitcoin, but I find the idea extremely charming nonetheless. The relationship between regulars at a location like a pub and the social desire to see everyone saving more seems to be part of the key. That, and a big party or something at the end when you get your money back. 

Honestly it‚Äôs probably not THAT far off from doable, but I think you might find that some tweaking of the rules would be needed in a 21 century era. Time locked transactions to each user‚Äôs wallet seems to be the main change here. You want to guarantee that each user retains control over their money to avoid fraud from the administrator (because I‚Äôm sure as many charming nostalgia articles about these groups as there are, there were likely just as many real-time stories of pub owners caught skimming off the top of peoples savings). So if you join the club, you‚Äôd be committing to saving X amount each week/month to a clean wallet/address, and each time you put money away, you‚Äôre either time locking to a specific date (2 weeks before Christmas, etc) or you‚Äôre setting each transaction 1 year out and it‚Äôs a rolling amount of unlocked money. 

The social aspect, and the collecting of fees is an interesting one, as I‚Äôm an American and we don‚Äôt necessarily have the ‚Äúpub culture‚Äù like Europeans do, so the idea of going to same place and having a bartender shake you down for a minimal fee seems to be a point of friction that may not happen as much as it did 40 years ago. Another conundrum is that depending on the year, a social club like this might be a raucous bull market party, or a bunch of depressed and annoyed bear market drinkers who feel like they got swindled.",2,2024-11-14 06:35:15,1731587715.0,Bitcoin
7437,1gr19oq,lx3ghmf,"It is not necessarily the bartender/barowner who takes care of that. They just accept the ""saving club"" to have their headquarter at his/her bar so there is more frequency there.   
Also the ""head"" of the club is normaly each year elected by the members. So it can vary and it is normaly a person which is known and trusted. Also he will be controlled by the cashier and vice versa(Fraud is of course still possible).   
Also when these clubs were introduced (in the 1840s) the big benefit was easy (and cheap) access to a savings accounts with higher rates. Since several people pay the fee for only 1 saving account instead of everybody pays the fees for an own one.   
  
AND since they had the support from the local bank (in most cases) they got even better conditions for saving. For this it would be interesting to get a collaboration with one of the many exchanges/wallet companys so that this club gets for the weekly savings there some extra conditions (less fees etc.) to make this club attractive for the people even from a money perspective. 

Self custody is in general nice but i also think about people who don¬¥t dare/want/are able to have a own wallet (whatever reason they have) but still to get some benefits from the whole setup.

*I am not the best with providing information, but I can share this. Also, I am sure someone more knowledgeable will chime in, but we see posts like this so frequently they might be taking a break. 


With that said, the common things you will hear from this sub are:

-Don't invest until you understand what you are investing in. 

-Don't over invest, only put in what you are willing to lose. 

-Don't invest an amount that will cause you to be emotional. 

-DCA'ing (Which means to ""Dollar Cost Average"" is the best way. This simply means to set up a consistent monthly amount to buy). Only what you can afford to lose and will not be emotional about. 

-Expect to hold (HODL) your investment for at least 4-5 years. This is not a get rich quick. It is a marathon, not a sprint. 

-Never, under any circumstances, no matter who the person claims to be, share your private keys with anyone. Also, never store them online. Keep them safe and only for you. If someone has your keys, they can steal every last Satoshi (Small increments of your Bitcoin) and you will never get it back. You are your own banker and are responsible for your own Bitcoin. 

Finally, don't leave your Bitcoin on an exchange. Always store it in a cold storage off line and not connected to any internet source. 

If any of this is unfamiliar with you then you need to get to studying. Learn everything you can. Learn enough to challenge people who both support and reject this ""Future of Money"". Be knowledgeable enough to defend and oppose Bitcoin so that you know where you stand and your own values on the topic. 

Best of luck to you.

Obviously a small position, but given the very conservative nature of this part of the investment sector, even small positions are symbolically important. 

These are not fast-money hedge funds; the investment process and criteria are rigorous. The 13F filing lists 73 total positions that include companies like Danaher, Eli Lilly and Honeywell. The Bitcoin position is larger than all those.

7615,1gqyfvz,lx3lpnb,"Some thoughts and big picture thinking towards BTC for those who need it:

When you stop caring what happens today, or next week, or next month... and just focus on increasing your score (total BTC held) you become Zen, realizing that up, down, sideways is all ok... **down** means you can increase your score faster... **sideways** means you have more time to grow your score before it rises... **up** means others are starting to accumulate too, but you're ahead of them.

it's win-win-win regardless of what the price does... the only reason some get stressed over BTC is because they expect something or want to sell soon (define as you will) to pay for something...

There are 8.2 billion people on earth. There are only 17M (give or  take 500k) BTC that are not lost forever. Some simple math would show that the average wealth of humanity would give every human 17M / 8.2b or 0.00207 BTC (207,000 satoshi). Factor in that the financial industry, companies and nation states are just starting to accumulate... and you can reduce that number by 50%, 70% or 90% depending on just how much of a blackhole those entities become for BTC holdings.

Point is... while people worry about what price to buy or sell at, They're missing the point that right now for about $18.63 worth of BTC you can secure your place in the top 50% of Earths combined wealth... and for the time being you can own multiples more than just average global wealth...

Everyone has their own motivations... some see BTC as a method to own a house, or retire... that's great. I view it as a mechanism to secure my financial future and securing my place in the top 1% before the current top 1% realizes what is happening...

7817,1gqvt7a,lx1dwr5,"Whilst the hard cap on supply definitely influences the VALUE of Bitcoin as an asset - the price is just set by the last traded value. 

This is a much smaller pool - the people willing to sell / wanting to buy at any point in time. 

So perhaps a better (and arguably more bullish) indicator of where market price may be headed is the (continually dropping) balance of Bitcoin being held on exchanges. 

This graph tells a story‚Ä¶
https://www.coinglass.com/Balance

Bitcoin is being taken off exchanges and stored in long term wallets - by holders, ETFs, companies and sovereign nation balance sheets. Mining companies are starting to run the micro strategy playbook - borrow against their Bitcoin to fund day-to-day operations rather than sell an increasingly valuable asset. 

The lower amount of bitcoin available on exchanges means a smaller amount of bitcoin is trying to absorb the relentless and increasing buy-side pressure. Hence number go up!

And mechanisms like ETFs and Microstrategy have made it easy for folks to get in without having to figure out wallets. Whilst holding BTC is better from a purist perspective - if they buy from an ETF, the ETF still needs to ultimately buy the bitcoin to support their position. 

And I believe we are early. This is still ‚Äúdial up internet‚Äù days. We are barely at the start of a significant increase in people, companies, pension funds and countries all wanting a piece.

The average human being owns about 0.0027 bitcoin.  The median human being owns zero.  The average won't go up but the median probably will.

The market cap of all bitcoin is $1.8 trillion.  The market cap of all currency is about $100 trillion.  For bitcoin to reach the market cap of all currency that would mean a price of about $5 million.

The market cap of all debt is about $300 trillion.  That means that today there is more debt than there is currency.  Debt will be incredibly difficult as well as dangerous in a hyper bitcoin era.  If you combine the value of all debt and currency, you have a combined value of all purchasing instruments.  If bitcoin were to equal that then it would reach around $20 million.

Over the years, I‚Äôve seen several people regret selling their BTC (BTC is most stable) too soon. Times are changing with overall crypto psychology amongst smart money rather than the degens. 

I‚Äôm seeing many individuals sell BTC to large buyers at these higher prices (above $80k/ BTC). These buyers are buying BTC in the 10‚Äôs of thousands. This shows that big money (institutional capital) is buying in the masses and are in it for the long run. 

They won‚Äôt treat BTC like individual traders, they will buy and securitize with bonds and public equities, making their money through the public offering. 

Why do I care? Well I‚Äôm a fan of the little guys. Institutions owns everything and are worth trillions of dollars. They will drive prices up like they are with the housing market. This may get downvoted bc institutions don‚Äôt want the avg person to know this type of info.

seems to me like there'd be a perfect paper trail from your payment method and email address to the retailer then from the retailer to Azteco where their servers will know exactly who paid for which redeemable key

I was curious and attempted to buy a voucher via Eneba, since I've used them before for video game keys, but once I got to checkout all of the typical payment methods (Paypal, Gpay, credit card) were marked as ineligible 

I looked at G2A as well, though didn't make it to the full checkout process. They're offering $10.54 worth of BTC for $11.37, but that's a nearly 8% premium

You don't want to regularly change your DCA pattern because then you will be price induced.  That might lead you to buy more when the price is high.  You might also quit buying when the price is low.

However if you feel like you can handle buying more then you might want to change your strategy.

The 80% drop should always be something that you are ready for.  When that happens you should be ready to buy more.  I used to have limit orders in place for big drops.

Then it went to, it's too complicated you will all get scammed (solved again with exchanges and etfs so mom and pop can buy and hold) and it's just an append only database (you wouldn't want anyone changing the values without everyone's approval wouldn't you?)

Then they said it uses too much energy and is bad for the environment as it's a waste of energy. Companies are using excess energy and using more renewable energy to mine it.

Then they pivot to it's only being used for illegal activities yet the ETFs are gobbling up everything on the stock market.

That place is filled with hypocrites. Some visitor asked if butters ever touched BTC, and something like 90% of people actually said yes, and about half of those, even made profits from it.

The advisor was looking over my accounts, balances and contributions, and made a note of my regular transfers of money to something she didn't reconize (Bitcoin Exchange).  I casually said I was buying Bitcoin.  The look of disapproval, sadness and contempt on her face I will never forget.  She advised against this and when I questioned her it was simply from her lack of knowledge or understanding.  I didn't feel like trying to explain it to her, so I just went with ""I think it's cool"", and she dropped it and we moved on.

[ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/) - air gapped, Bitcoin only, has advanced features but a new user will do fine with one of the great tutorials available.

[BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/bitcoin-only/) - another great little device, opt for the more secure Bitcoin ONLY version (less coins = less code = less chance for a hidden bug or a backdoor) 

[Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade) - air gapped, fully open source, Bitcoin only, great features. You can even [build it on your own](https://github.com/Blockstream/jade/), if you feel adventurous. 

[Seedsigner](https://github.com/SeedSigner/seedsigner) - another DIY, fully open source, air gapped, Bitcoin only hardware wallet, not for you if you're just starting up but something to consider later.

[Krux wallet](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/) - one more DIY hardware device, I love this one for many reasons. Similar to Seedsigner, it's fully open source, air gapped, Bitcoin only hardware wallet, that is not for you right now if you're just starting up, but something to consider at a later stage and/or to up the security of your bitcoin. 


Whatever wallet you'll decide to buy, purchase DIRECTLY from the manufacturer, no eBay, no Amazon. 

Make sure the device is NOT preset, and you will generate your own seed words. Write them down on any piece of paper as well as the receiving address. Now wipe the wallet and generate a new wallet. If the seed words are different from the first set, you're safe to use it. 

Find an option to set a passphrase and use it. This will boost the security to another level. Never store the seed words and passphrase together. Use a different medium if possible. If somebody finds both, they'll be able to steal your coin. 

This little device will hold the keys to your money, that's the reason why you have to be a bit more careful. Also, no worries, if it breaks, you can replace it - as long as you keep your seed words and passphrase(s) safe.

The following is not financial advice, it is just hypothetical musings:

The answer to this question varies on your age. The younger you are, typically the more riskier your portfolio can be, because you have time on your side. If you‚Äôre in your 20s-early 30s, I‚Äôd personally probably keep 6 months worth of bills in a savings account, then with the remainder put about 50% of it into an S&P500 ETF like VOO, put about 15-20% into shares of companies I view a bright future in (for me, it‚Äôs been TSLA since 2016). Then maybe 30% into crypto; for me it would be almost exclusively BTC. 

Obviously the smart thing to do would be to DCA and not buy lump sums all at once.",3,2024-11-13 09:09:22,1731510562.0,Bitcoin

I'm prepared for it to go back towards zero (but don't think it will).

One line of questioning, that most crypto advocates and believers I've encountered tend to react negatively to, is around the risk scenario of temporarily losing internet connectivity for several weeks or months, and how that will affect the value of cryptocurrencies as well as personal access and utility. My view is that their respective portfolios have a lot more allocated to crypto than mine, and don't want to fully process this scenario, however unlikely it might be. But the truth is always our friend, no matter how unpleasant it feels.

However, Bitcoin et al also have unique limitations and risks. The skeptics aren't completely wrong.

My view of diversification is that crypto should be less than 80% of a person's net worth, and that's only if they allocated 20% at most to it years ago, and have been regularly taking profit and allocating to other assets. At this point, I'm happy with a 2% allocation, as I am looking to protect capital as much as growing wealth, if not more, as I am close to retirement.",0,2024-11-13 09:40:16,1731512416.0,Bitcoin

My guess is that a few providers will allow for store-and-forward solutions, including paper recording/imprinting. But they will need to add very high fees and exacting terms in exchange for this service. For example, my guess is that the Whole Foods near me would have long lines to enter, to register my credit card and customer information. Then once I had collected my groceries, more long lines to account for my purchases, and a $10-40 credit card transaction fee.

I also think that there would be limited cash available from local banks in the case of extended internet outages across regions, which WF would accept without the additional credit card pain.

Having reached prices much higher than the mining network could possibly sustain, it crashes and gets over sold to half the average mining cost of the peak or around today's price of $80k.

Fidelity and many other institutions offer an etf on the spot price of btc. If you have the ability to choose where your retirement account invests specifically it doesn't hurt to looking holding some of the etf. Or buy it with your regular Brokerage, I would recommend btc directly if you are using non retirement money.

If you want to use retirement funds to buy bitcoin look into a self directed retirement account. There are a few companies that do the paperwork for you for a cost under 2k . You will be required to file franchise tax each year for your self directed account. It's not hard just need to be on top of the deadlines.

They also charge a fee quarterly to keep statements on value for your tax filing annually. Still worth it for all of those costs as btc would out perform the costs in the overall long run as long as it continues to rise and hold value.",1,2024-11-13 09:45:28,1731512728.0,Bitcoin

9666,1gqaorl,lwwsp90,"Chat GPT: The Fold Mining Club Bitaxe bundle seems like an interesting proposition for someone who wants to get into Bitcoin mining as a hobby. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the key points and some considerations:

Pros

	1.	Low Cost of Entry: At $259, this is relatively affordable compared to larger ASIC miners, which can cost thousands of dollars.
	2.	Easy Setup: The product is designed to be plug-and-play, which means minimal technical expertise is needed to get started.
	3.	Learning Opportunity: This could be a fun way to learn about Bitcoin mining and blockchain technology in a hands-on manner.
	4.	Community Engagement: Being part of a mining club may foster a sense of community, where users can share experiences and tips.
	5.	Electricity Covered: Fold offers to cover the electricity costs for the first year, which helps lower the barriers to entry and reduces the initial expenses.

Cons

	1.	Very Low Hashrate Contribution: The hash rate contribution of 0.00006 EH/s is minimal, and Fold notes that each user will contribute a very tiny portion of the network‚Äôs overall security. This means you shouldn‚Äôt expect significant earnings or substantial mining rewards.
	2.	Long-Term Profitability: Given the low hashing power, this is unlikely to be profitable in the long term. Industrial-scale miners with high-powered ASICs dominate the Bitcoin network.
	3.	Reliance on Fold‚Äôs Offer: If Fold covers electricity for only one year, you might end up paying for power after that, which could eat into any potential earnings from mining.

Overall Recommendation

This bundle could be worthwhile if you‚Äôre looking for a fun, educational experience in crypto and Bitcoin mining. However, if your goal is to earn significant rewards or profit, this might not be the best route due to its limited power and potential profitability constraints. It seems more suitable for enthusiasts than for serious miners.",2,2024-11-13 07:04:47,1731503087.0,Bitcoin

Entering the top 10 or something will make a difference.

9820,1gq7g3n,lwvv7b8,"While I would rather not personally recommend any specific company, there are several that specialize in wallet recovery that may be able to safely recover your wallet from the drive. 

A simple Google search for ""professional Bitcoin wallet recovery"" should bring up several results for you to research.

The downside to this would be that they would want a percent of the coins that are recovered, a fair ask in most cases.

You could also  simply go through a major reputable data recovery service to either recover the data from the drive or repair the drive to a working state so that you can then attempt recovery of your wallet yourself.  At which point I would swiftly move the coins to a new wallet for safety.

Failing remembering your password you could use the Bitcoin wallet recovery services.

That said, knowing how your drive died may be of more help. Does it simply not power up anymore or does it have issues reading the data?

Just a word of caution connecting the drive to power for any reason currently might cause further damage if a head collision were to occur with the disc platter, so I would advise against it and let professionals handle the recovery.


Just my thoughts. I'm sure someone else will offer further insight.

330 sats.  550 sats.  450 sats.  I've seen them in various amounts and for various reasons.  Most of them take months to actually go through since they set the fee so low.  And for these lookalike dust attacks, I wonder if they even care if the transaction goes through.  They probably just want the initial mempool notification of an incoming transaction, because all they actually care about is the recipient getting the lookalike incoming address to possibly copy/paste into a future transaction.

Generic dust attacks I assume are more about linking transactions to multiple addresses, in an attempt to figure out which addresses are part of the same wallet and maybe figure out who owns the wallet.

But this lookalike dust attack is something else, as you said they're ""hoping people will just copy and paste their imposter address and accidentally send them money.""

Some of the dust attacks are expensive, too.  I've noticed a few shelling out thousands of dollars in 550 sat chunks.

9843,1gq71b9,lwvvn5v,"> how does one just generate a bitcoin address with specifically chosen characters?

I assume somebody has a list of millions of addresses that have a balance, and they're running a script, searching for seeds that generate addresses which look similar.  When the script finds a lookalike address, they send dust from that address to the address with a balance.  I'm just guessing though.

I received dust from an address that starts with the same first few characters as mine and ends with the same few characters from mine, but everything in between is different.  On first glance, it looked like I'd sent dust to myself, which was bizarre.  I was wondering if somebody had found a way to spoof addresses, but then I realized the middle of the address was different.

We also have practically every image model supported. Recraft V3 is the current top of the leaderboard and it's our default model, we also support Flux Pro V1.1, Ideogram V2, Stable Diffusion V3.5 Large, SDXL, DALL-E, and allow you to turn off censoring on the models that support it by going into settings. We also have what is widely considered the best 18+ model in Promptchan.

Our service is built for privacy - we don't store any prompts or conversations, you can use our service even without making an account.

Minimum deposit is just $1, we used BTCPayServer to integrate Bitcoin. Superb service, can very much recommend it for anyone looking to accept BTC payments.

We love to see more actual usage of crypto and want to try and build more of a circular ecosystem around crypto, so we also have an Earn page to show people how to earn little bits of crypto. We'd love suggestions to add there for Bitcoin, so let us know which ones you think are best.

We all have been where you're at, read/bookmark this guide and make sure to learn along your journey. 

Congrats on the move, it's never too late. ONLY INVEST MONEY YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE. 

Invest in your knowledge, learn about Bitcoin as much as you can. The Bitcoin Standard book is a must read. So is Broken Money book. Get them and READ them both, please. 

Also, **don't reply any DMs**, emails, private messages on other social media, promising to buy Bitcoin from them or get rich quick and read this short guide, please:

**Price wise, nobody knows what the price will be tomorrow, next week or at the end of the year.** 

**Try ""Bitcoin ONLY"" strategy for at least the first 210,000 block cycle**, you'll sleep much better. Newcomers lose so much money, holding garbage tokens just because someone on YT told them to. If you don't like losing money in [failed coins](https://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/how-many-cryptocurrencies-failed), avoid. 

Going DCA is probably the best approach, IMHO. 
Bitcoin to me, is a savings account. If I have some spare cash, I exchange it for sats. Once a week works best for me, but I'm getting paid weekly. If there's a 10% drop in the price since my last buy, I usually double my buy. This [DCA calculator](https://dca.bitnob.com/) might help to decide what will work best for you. In a few years, even $10 dollars a month can make a massive difference. This [DCA blog](https://er-bybitcoin.com/) is pretty interesting. 

Now, don't buy a fake Bitcoin at a spot ETF place or similar, **get the real thing** that you can withdraw anytime you want. Register at a proper exchange and buy real Bitcoin. Any of these will do [https://bitcoin-only.com/get-bitcoin](https://bitcoin-only.com/get-bitcoin) 

Install (or buy - in case you're getting Bitcoin in Thousands of $) one or more of these wallets.

A few good wallet choices:

[https://blockstream.com/green/](https://blockstream.com/green/) \- Top Security Features, Open Source and Non-Custodial

[https://bluewallet.io](https://bluewallet.io/) \- excellent, easy to use wallet, Open Source and Non-Custodial 

[https://www.sparrowwallet.com](https://www.sparrowwallet.com) - top desktop wallet 

[https://electrum.org](https://electrum.org/) \- Solid choice, Open Source and Non-Custodial, one of the oldest and most trusted Bitcoin Wallets. I prefer the desktop version but it works on mobile too.

Lightning wallets to consider (cheaper and faster transactions, great for small amounts):

[https://phoenix.acinq.co/](https://phoenix.acinq.co/) \- Phoenix - very good wallet, uses Tor for extra privacy, easy for anyone new 

[https://blixtwallet.github.io/](https://blixtwallet.github.io/) \- Blixt - great UI, fast and clean 

[https://breez.technology](https://breez.technology/) \- Breez - excellent POS for small business owners as well as integrated Bitrefill or LN Pizza

[https://zeusln.com/](https://zeusln.com/) Zeus - impressive wallet with many features, can even generate Nostr keys

Hardware Wallets (to store larger amounts):

[Trezor](https://trezor.io/) \- Easy to use, no matter how new in Bitcoin you're. Use the Bitcoin only firmware as it's safer than a multi coin software. 

[ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/) - air gapped, Bitcoin only, has advanced features but a new user will do fine with one of the great tutorials available.

[BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/bitcoin-only/) - another great little device, opt for the more secure Bitcoin ONLY version (less coins = less code = less chance for a hidden bug or a backdoor) 

[Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade) - air gapped, fully open source, Bitcoin only, great features. You can even [build it on your own](https://github.com/Blockstream/jade/), if you feel adventurous. 

[Seedsigner](https://github.com/SeedSigner/seedsigner) - another DIY, fully open source, air gapped, Bitcoin only hardware wallet, not for you if you're just starting up but something to consider later.

[Krux wallet](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/) - one more DIY hardware device, I love this one for many reasons. Similar to Seedsigner, it's fully open source, air gapped, Bitcoin only hardware wallet, that is not for you right now if you're just starting up, but something to consider at a later stage and/or to up the security of your bitcoin. 


There's also Ledger, but I wouldn't recommend it as it's not fully open source, keep and already leaked customers' details, recently said they're capable of sending customers' keys out just with a firmware update, etc. **Stay away**, save yourself a headache in the future. 

Whatever wallet you'll decide to buy, purchase DIRECTLY from the manufacturer, no eBay, no Amazon. 

Make sure the device is NOT preset, and you will generate your own seed words. Write them down on any piece of paper as well as the receiving address. Now wipe the wallet and generate a new wallet. If the seed words are different from the first set, you're safe to use it. 

Find an option to set a passphrase and use it. This will boost the security to another level. Never store the seed words and passphrase together. Use a different medium if possible. If somebody finds both, they'll be able to steal your coin. 

This little device will hold the keys to your money, that's the reason why you have to be a bit more careful. Also, no worries, if it breaks, you can replace it - as long as you keep your seed words and passphrase(s) safe.

The dangers splitting a seed is that if either piece is lost, your coin is gone. With 2 of 4, you have to lose 3 of your seeds for your coin to be lost. Any 2 can sign.

10128,1gq26rp,lwusgua,"You have to weigh the risk of losing your crypto to a company like FTX, Mt Gox or Quadriga versus the chances that armed robbers will break into your home to steal your crypto.

If you have a device like Trezor or Ledger, you'll probably have a 12 word seed phrase in which you can put a small amount of Bitcoin to (hopefully) satisfy a thief. But secretly you can have additional  passwords that nobody but you will know about. You can store this secret password in a safety deposit box if you want your children to inherit it one day without it being lost forever.

For example, if your 12 word seed phrase is apple, banana, carrot, ...., llama that will generate one set of private keys for your small stash of bitcoin. Secretly you can create a secret password like ""thisismysecret"". When you combine the 12 word seed phrase AND the passcode, an entirely different set of private keys will be generated that nobody but you knows about. Use this to store the majority of your Bitcoin. If someone breaks into your home, swear on your grandmother's grave that you've never even heard of a password before, but you can share the 12 word phrase if your life depends on it.

After your small stash is stolen, there's always a risk someone will search through common passwords to try to find the bulk of your funds. If your password is easy to guess (hint: don't do that), you should generate a brand new 12-word seed phrase with a new password, and transfer all your Bitcoin to this new address the first chance you get.",3,2024-11-12 20:32:40,1731465160.0,Bitcoin

We all have been where you're at, read/bookmark this guide and make sure to learn along your journey. 

Congrats on the move, it's never too late. ONLY INVEST MONEY YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE. 

Invest in your knowledge, learn about Bitcoin as much as you can. The Bitcoin Standard book is a must read. So is Broken Money book. Get them and READ them both, please. 

Also, **don't reply any DMs**, emails, private messages on other social media, promising to buy Bitcoin from them or get rich quick and read this short guide, please:

**Price wise, nobody knows what the price will be tomorrow, next week or at the end of the year.** 

**Try ""Bitcoin ONLY"" strategy for at least the first 210,000 block cycle**, you'll sleep much better. Newcomers lose so much money, holding garbage tokens just because someone on YT told them to. If you don't like losing money in [failed coins](https://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/how-many-cryptocurrencies-failed), avoid. 

Going DCA is probably the best approach, IMHO. 
Bitcoin to me, is a savings account. If I have some spare cash, I exchange it for sats. Once a week works best for me, but I'm getting paid weekly. If there's a 10% drop in the price since my last buy, I usually double my buy. This [DCA calculator](https://dca.bitnob.com/) might help to decide what will work best for you. In a few years, even $10 dollars a month can make a massive difference. This [DCA blog](https://er-bybitcoin.com/) is pretty interesting. 

Now, don't buy a fake Bitcoin at a spot ETF place or similar, **get the real thing** that you can withdraw anytime you want. Register at a proper exchange and buy real Bitcoin. Any of these will do [https://bitcoin-only.com/get-bitcoin](https://bitcoin-only.com/get-bitcoin) 

Install (or buy - in case you're getting Bitcoin in Thousands of $) one or more of these wallets.

A few good wallet choices:

[https://blockstream.com/green/](https://blockstream.com/green/) \- Top Security Features, Open Source and Non-Custodial

[https://bluewallet.io](https://bluewallet.io/) \- excellent, easy to use wallet, Open Source and Non-Custodial 

[https://www.sparrowwallet.com](https://www.sparrowwallet.com) - top desktop wallet 

[https://electrum.org](https://electrum.org/) \- Solid choice, Open Source and Non-Custodial, one of the oldest and most trusted Bitcoin Wallets. I prefer the desktop version but it works on mobile too.

Lightning wallets to consider (cheaper and faster transactions, great for small amounts):

[https://phoenix.acinq.co/](https://phoenix.acinq.co/) \- Phoenix - very good wallet, uses Tor for extra privacy, easy for anyone new 

[https://blixtwallet.github.io/](https://blixtwallet.github.io/) \- Blixt - great UI, fast and clean 

[https://breez.technology](https://breez.technology/) \- Breez - excellent POS for small business owners as well as integrated Bitrefill or LN Pizza

[https://zeusln.com/](https://zeusln.com/) Zeus - impressive wallet with many features, can even generate Nostr keys

Hardware Wallets (to store larger amounts):

[Trezor](https://trezor.io/) \- Easy to use, no matter how new in Bitcoin you're. Use the Bitcoin only firmware as it's safer than a multi coin software. 

[ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/) - air gapped, Bitcoin only, has advanced features but a new user will do fine with one of the great tutorials available.

[BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/bitcoin-only/) - another great little device, opt for the more secure Bitcoin ONLY version (less coins = less code = less chance for a hidden bug or a backdoor) 

[Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade) - air gapped, fully open source, Bitcoin only, great features. You can even [build it on your own](https://github.com/Blockstream/jade/), if you feel adventurous. 

[Seedsigner](https://github.com/SeedSigner/seedsigner) - another DIY, fully open source, air gapped, Bitcoin only hardware wallet, not for you if you're just starting up but something to consider later.

[Krux wallet](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/) - one more DIY hardware device, I love this one for many reasons. Similar to Seedsigner, it's fully open source, air gapped, Bitcoin only hardware wallet, that is not for you right now if you're just starting up, but something to consider at a later stage and/or to up the security of your bitcoin. 


There's also Ledger, but I wouldn't recommend it as it's not fully open source, keep and already leaked customers' details, recently said they're capable of sending customers' keys out just with a firmware update, etc. **Stay away**, save yourself a headache in the future. 

Whatever wallet you'll decide to buy, purchase DIRECTLY from the manufacturer, no eBay, no Amazon. 

Make sure the device is NOT preset, and you will generate your own seed words. Write them down on any piece of paper as well as the receiving address. Now wipe the wallet and generate a new wallet. If the seed words are different from the first set, you're safe to use it. 

Find an option to set a passphrase and use it. This will boost the security to another level. Never store the seed words and passphrase together. Use a different medium if possible. If somebody finds both, they'll be able to steal your coin. 

This little device will hold the keys to your money, that's the reason why you have to be a bit more careful. Also, no worries, if it breaks, you can replace it - as long as you keep your seed words and passphrase(s) safe.

Those who've been in the space a long time will remember this was happening a lot many years ago: when a miner finds a block it has to publish it and make the other nodes and miners aware. If you are a large enough miner, you can delay publishing the block for a short while, while you start working on the next block, and thus gain an advantage over all other miners who are still working on the old block that you already found. There is a risk that another miner can find the block and publish it before you do if you delay for too long, but if you are one of the largest miners then you will get a statistical advantage on average.

Then I concluded that this technology was way to impractical to ever be successful and went on to do different things.

Until end 2011. At which point you can imagine I felt stupid as f\*ck. Luckily I had a few coins left in a backup of my Desktop computer. Wise as I had become, I would no longer place them on an USB disk or any other physical device, so I placed them in an Mt. Gox account. üíÄ

After the Mt. Gox payout this year, I got about half a BTC back. Still good for a ‚Ç¨50 investment, but that USB stick would have made me about 40 million in todays value.

Now that you're buying Bitcoin, you should learn more about what it is you have bought. If you don't learn these fundamentals, you will sell it out of fear and in 1, 5, 10 years you will be very angry with yourself for not knowing more.

Bitcoin isn't an investment. Its the hardest form of money we as a species has ever had access to. I have compiled a shortlist of videos to help aid your understanding. The 4th video is the real gem in this list and I'd suggest watching it first. It teaches you key concepts about money. Once these concepts are understood, you can look at Bitcoin & the US dollar and fully understand what makes bitcoin ""money"", and the US dollar (a fiat currency).. and the implications of both.

Start here:

Clip 1: What bitcoin is, the problem it fixes, and why its the solution  
[https://youtu.be/pBmK3pI7uKw?si=n59JkGuJ\_gP\_dEd5](https://youtu.be/pBmK3pI7uKw?si=n59JkGuJ_gP_dEd5)

Clip 2: Why you never need to sell bitcoin.

Clip 3: All Fiat currencies in history have gone to zero, the American Dollar (which is fiat.. meaning has no sound money (like gold or bitcoin) backing it. The gold backing of the dollar ended in 1971 with Nixon, which is when the dollar became fiat currency)  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJDqQn7WC1U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJDqQn7WC1U)¬†

Clip 4: The difference between ""Currency"" & ""Money"".. What is sound money, and why gold (and now bitcoin) fits this description (This series was originally made in 2010, before bitcoin was well known). Feel free to watch all 10 videos in the series in your spare time, but if you do anything, at least watch the 1st vid in the series. (This might be the most important video here)  
[https://youtu.be/DyV0OfU3-FU?si=OqJ93-gHpcQjsvRH](https://youtu.be/DyV0OfU3-FU?si=OqJ93-gHpcQjsvRH)

There's a lot of information here, and there's so much more out there that can be learned of course. However, when you come out the other side of this information, you will have a solid foundation. This is the type of thing that puts you ahead of most people in the market as most people don't understand these concepts. MOST people will never learn these things, and they will fall victim to the effects of flawed monetary systems. I hope this information finds you well.",9,2024-11-12 15:38:47,1731447527.0,Bitcoin

Coldcard MK4 @ $158 is great if you just want to park stuff there and pull it out on rare occasion. It's usable of course, but the dot matrix looking menus and clicky buttons offer somewhat clunkier usability. It would take me longer to do a function with MK4 VS Safe 5.

Tax Savings = **Capital Gains Tax Avoided** \+ **Charitable Deduction Savings**

**-Capital Gains Tax Avoided:**

*Calculation: (Fair Market Value - Cost Basis) x Capital Gains Tax Rate*

By donating the Bitcoin directly, you avoid paying capital gains tax on the appreciation. (I'd refrain from doing cash as you don't maximize your savings)

**-Charitable Deduction Savings:**

*Calculation: Fair Market Value x Marginal Income Tax Rate*

You can deduct the fair market value of the donated Bitcoin from your taxable income, up to IRS limits.

**Total Tax Savings Example:**

‚Ä¢ Fair Market Value (Current Bitcoin Price): $90,000

‚Ä¢ Cost Basis (Original Purchase Price): $10,000

‚Ä¢ Appreciation: $80,000

Capital Gains Tax Avoided:

‚Ä¢ $80,000 (Appreciation) x 20% (Long-Term Capital Gains Tax Rate) = $16,000

‚Ä¢ Charitable Deduction Savings:

‚Ä¢ $90,000 (Fair Market Value) x 37% (Top Marginal Income Tax Rate) = $33,300

Total Estimated Tax Savings:

‚Ä¢ $16,000 (Capital Gains Tax Avoided) + $33,300 (Charitable Deduction Savings) = $49,300",4,2024-11-12 11:37:11,1731433031.0,Bitcoin

11070,1gpp8id,lwrxkc1,"We all have been where you're at, read/bookmark this guide and make sure to learn along your journey. 

Congrats on the move, it's never too late. ONLY INVEST MONEY YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE. 

Invest in your knowledge, learn about Bitcoin as much as you can. The Bitcoin Standard book is a must read. So is Broken Money book. Get them and READ them both, please. 

Also, **don't reply any DMs**, emails, private messages on other social media, promising to buy Bitcoin from them or get rich quick and read this short guide, please:

**Price wise, nobody knows what the price will be tomorrow, next week or at the end of the year.** 

**Try ""Bitcoin ONLY"" strategy for at least the first 210,000 block cycle**, you'll sleep much better. Newcomers lose so much money, holding garbage tokens just because someone on YT told them to. If you don't like losing money in [failed coins](https://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/how-many-cryptocurrencies-failed), avoid. 

Going DCA is probably the best approach, IMHO. 
Bitcoin to me, is a savings account. If I have some spare cash, I exchange it for sats. Once a week works best for me, but I'm getting paid weekly. If there's a 10% drop in the price since my last buy, I usually double my buy. This [DCA calculator](https://dca.bitnob.com/) might help to decide what will work best for you. In a few years, even $10 dollars a month can make a massive difference. This [DCA blog](https://er-bybitcoin.com/) is pretty interesting. 

Now, don't buy a fake Bitcoin at a spot ETF place or similar, **get the real thing** that you can withdraw anytime you want. Register at a proper exchange and buy real Bitcoin. Any of these will do [https://bitcoin-only.com/get-bitcoin](https://bitcoin-only.com/get-bitcoin) 

Install (or buy - in case you're getting Bitcoin in Thousands of $) one or more of these wallets.

A few good wallet choices:

[https://blockstream.com/green/](https://blockstream.com/green/) \- Top Security Features, Open Source and Non-Custodial

[https://bluewallet.io](https://bluewallet.io/) \- excellent, easy to use wallet, Open Source and Non-Custodial 

[https://www.sparrowwallet.com](https://www.sparrowwallet.com) - top desktop wallet 

[https://electrum.org](https://electrum.org/) \- Solid choice, Open Source and Non-Custodial, one of the oldest and most trusted Bitcoin Wallets. I prefer the desktop version but it works on mobile too.

Lightning wallets to consider (cheaper and faster transactions, great for small amounts):

[https://phoenix.acinq.co/](https://phoenix.acinq.co/) \- Phoenix - very good wallet, uses Tor for extra privacy, easy for anyone new 

[https://blixtwallet.github.io/](https://blixtwallet.github.io/) \- Blixt - great UI, fast and clean 

[https://breez.technology](https://breez.technology/) \- Breez - excellent POS for small business owners as well as integrated Bitrefill or LN Pizza

[https://zeusln.com/](https://zeusln.com/) Zeus - impressive wallet with many features, can even generate Nostr keys

Hardware Wallets (to store larger amounts):

[Trezor](https://trezor.io/) \- Easy to use, no matter how new in Bitcoin you're. Use the Bitcoin only firmware as it's safer than a multi coin software. 

[ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/) - air gapped, Bitcoin only, has advanced features but a new user will do fine with one of the great tutorials available.

[BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/bitcoin-only/) - another great little device, opt for the more secure Bitcoin ONLY version (less coins = less code = less chance for a hidden bug or a backdoor) 

[Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade) - air gapped, fully open source, Bitcoin only, great features. You can even [build it on your own](https://github.com/Blockstream/jade/), if you feel adventurous. 

[Seedsigner](https://github.com/SeedSigner/seedsigner) - another DIY, fully open source, air gapped, Bitcoin only hardware wallet, not for you if you're just starting up but something to consider later.

[Krux wallet](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/) - one more DIY hardware device, I love this one for many reasons. Similar to Seedsigner, it's fully open source, air gapped, Bitcoin only hardware wallet, that is not for you right now if you're just starting up, but something to consider at a later stage and/or to up the security of your bitcoin. 


There's also Ledger, but I wouldn't recommend it as it's not fully open source, keep and already leaked customers' details, recently said they're capable of sending customers' keys out just with a firmware update, etc. **Stay away**, save yourself a headache in the future. 

Whatever wallet you'll decide to buy, purchase DIRECTLY from the manufacturer, no eBay, no Amazon. 

Make sure the device is NOT preset, and you will generate your own seed words. Write them down on any piece of paper as well as the receiving address. Now wipe the wallet and generate a new wallet. If the seed words are different from the first set, you're safe to use it. 

Find an option to set a passphrase and use it. This will boost the security to another level. Never store the seed words and passphrase together. Use a different medium if possible. If somebody finds both, they'll be able to steal your coin. 

This little device will hold the keys to your money, that's the reason why you have to be a bit more careful. Also, no worries, if it breaks, you can replace it - as long as you keep your seed words and passphrase(s) safe.

Welcome to the rabbit hole and don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions anytime during your Bitcoin journey.

They sold it because they are required to sell all assets confiscated in a criminal trial, regardless of whether it's bitcoin, fiat money, or real estate. A Generalstaatsanwalt is not an investor!

Not a single politician was involved in the decision to sell the Bitcoins. Keeping the Bitcoins was never an option. Therefore, there isn't a single politician in Germany that currently reacts like this meme suggests.

At it's core, he's right. Inflationary money supply leads to higher prices of scarce assets (commodities, stocks, etc). But he's wrong in saying that a 10% increase in the money supply means that a 10% increase in the stock market is a wash for your investments.

1) A 10% rise in money supply doesn't equate to a 10% rise in consumer prices of goods.
2) The stock market's capital size is far greater than the circulating money supply. A 10% increase in one is far different in absolute terms than a 10% rise in the other. In other words, 10% rise in money supply won't move the stock market 10%.
3) The fed has a lot of tools at their disposal that can be equated to ""increasing money supply"", but not all of them have direct impacts on consumer good prices. Quantitative easing, interest rates, reserve and excess ratios, etc.
4) Some money goes into savings or recapitalization of banks and thus doesn't impact consumer prices, at least not immediately.
5) When you invest in the stock market, your entire point of investing is to make gains against the price of goods (CPI inflation). This way you've saved for the future with savings while growing those savings with real returns above CPI inflation. 

TLDR, no the money supply growing 10% does not wipe out stock market returns of 10%. If consumer good pricing (CPI inflation) equaled what you made in the stock market, then that would be true since your nominal returns wouldn't surpass the rise in price of goods.

You've never sold? Just watching it go up and celebrating by yourself cause no one around you owns BTC? Well now your asking yourself why you didn't by more. Why you doubted the project ever so slightly 2 years ago and didn't DCA more of your income.

You didn't do any of this? Just sitting on the sidelines waiting for your turn to jump in for the first time? It never dips, and you're waiting FOREVER only to tell people in 10 years 'I heard about it in 2024 when it was 60K but never bought it, now it's worth 1 million a coin'.

11772,1gpg4su,lws7kg6,"Actually, you don‚Äôt have to hit 99 k to reach 100 k, technically speaking. There may be no sell orders on 99 k, and the market price might just never hit 99 k, but skip it and go directly to say 99.01 k. Not a single coin has to be sold at 99 k for bitcoin to reach 100 k. Of course, bitcoin has a lot of liquidity and solid order books, so in practice, it will of course hit 99 k before 100 k. But it doesn‚Äôt HAVE to.",2,2024-11-12 12:02:26,1731434546.0,Bitcoin
