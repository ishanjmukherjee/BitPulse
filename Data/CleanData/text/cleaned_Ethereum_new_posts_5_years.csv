One where an individual can make the money on their person more secure than the gold held at Fort Knox, and can single-handedly effect execute any kind of financial transaction faster and cheaper than a global banking system comprised of companies worth trillions of dollars.

It's a technological project whose success means total political and economic revolution. It's the grand culmination of several lines of technological evolution: from the discovery of language, math and writing, to the harnessing of electricity and the invention of computers.

63,2024-11-08,"Non-Crypto Trader with a questionI am not a crypto trader. I do have a friend who is, though it's not a close acquaintance. They said if I wanted to try, I could download trust wallet, coinbase wallet, then send them my Ethereum address from in Coinbase wallet, fund my account through Trust Wallet, and they would use my Ethereum address to ""synchronize"" our accounts so that whatever trades they made, I would make automatically with whatever money I wanted to put in. (Say, 500 bucks for instance).

To me, this sounds extremely shady. They aren't explaining how they would sync our accounts, what method/program they use, etc. However, the average online search says sending someone an Ethereum address is generally safe. I just don't see how they could use that sole information to do what they're saying. If so, by what method?

I initially saw this as a harmless way to have a glimpse into what trading in crypto is like. But now I'm starting to feel as if there is a method of phishing/scamming of which I'm not aware, and I don't want anyone with access to my personal/financial information for obvious reasons.

If someone could explain to me how this works in layman's terms (ELI5) or whether this is a setup to grift money and/or personal info, I'd appreciate it! They're very annoyed by all my questions, which is part of why I'm so skeptical. Seems like there would be no reason to hide what they're doing or how if it was safe and legitimate.

Anyway, let me know what I'm missing, if anything. Or confirm what my gut says -- that this isn't a real thing, and someone is trying to see if they found a new mark.

EDIT: Thanks for the helpful (and expected) responses!  Like I said, I was never planning on getting into crypto regardless. Just not my bag, personally.

TL;DR:

* Just analyzed Lido's validator data and found something crazy
* 99.4% vs 97.5% effectiveness = \~0.1 ETH difference per year (32 ETH stake)
* Not just simple math - rewards actually compound through multiple mechanisms
* Finally understand why DVT validators consistently earn more 

Yo!  Fellow ETH stakers,

Been going down a rabbit hole analyzing validator data (because that's what we do on Sunday nights, right? ). Found some mind-blowing stuff about how effectiveness REALLY impacts rewards.

The nerdy stuff first (I promise it gets interesting):

Basic staking math:

    Max theoretical APY = [base reward/epoch * epochs/year * 32 attestations] + block proposals
    = (4*10^-7 * 82,125 * 32) + ~0.5%
    ≈ 4.2%

But here's where it gets spicy 

Real rewards are affected by:

* Attestations (the bread & butter, \~95% of rewards)
* Block proposals (the juicy 5%)
* Sync committee rewards
* MEV (the cherry on top)

Looking at actual data from Lido's SimpleDVT validators:

* DVT validators: 99.4% effectiveness → 4.06% APY
* Average validators: 97.52% effectiveness → 3.74% APY

""But wait,"" I hear you say, ""that's just a 1.88% difference!""

NOPE. Here's the real impact on 32 ETH:

* 3.74% = 1.197 ETH/year
* 4.06% = 1.299 ETH/year
* Difference = 0.102 ETH money-focused

Why such a big difference? Because when you miss attestations:

1. You lose the base reward
2. Get slapped with penalties
3. Miss sync committee opportunities
4. Network delays snowball

The most interesting part? This data is from SSV-powered validators on Lido. Turns out distributed validation isn't just fancy tech - it's actually putting more ETH in people's wallets.

Lots of beneficial products could come from this; for example, in gaming arcades, hardware wallets could provide you with identity.

One of the problems with Ledger is that they are closed source, and as we found out not long ago—not really ""our"" keys, as they can export them (no thank you).

96,2024-11-02,"Market risk of a 51% attack on PolymarketOver the past few days, I did a deep dive into Polymarket's implementation and the current state of the market. Here’s what I’ve found:

UMA is a cryptocurrency protocol that created a system to verify statement accuracy (e.g., 'Trump won the 2024 election'), which they call their 'Optimistic Oracle'. An 'Asserter' can post (assert) this information to the network, staking some cryptocurrency (any approved ERC20 token) alongside the assertion. Anyone who wants to dispute it (the 'Disputer') may do so, typically by matching the Asserter's stake. If a dispute happens, the process escalates to the 'Data Verification Mechanism' (DVM). When it reaches DVM, the tokenholders of UMA decide by vote how the assertion should resolve (i.e., ultimately whether the Asserter or the Disputer receives the staked currencies). They do this with one vote per UMA token.

Polymarket operates as a separate contract on the blockchain that interacts with UMA. The API allows users to create betting markets, bet on them, and perform various tasks. The Polymarket API also allows users to propose and dispute the outcomes of the betting markets when they end, costing about $750 to assert, and then another $750 to dispute. If there is a dispute, it gets escalated to UMA's DVM system. Disputes rarely happen because the DVM works. Typically, nobody has any incentive to lose their $750. This clever solution allows them to run a completely decentralized betting market that cannot be shut down.

However, the market cap of UMA is only about $200m as of writing this post. A 51% attacker would need to own approximately $100m worth of it. It is my understanding that any single person and/or collaborative group of people with such a quantity of UMA could then purchase and dispute one side of every contract on Polymarket, vote in favor of themselves during the DVM for each of them, and win every bet. Doing this would destroy their $100m of UMA, but they'll potentially make more from the bets.

A quick browse of Polymarket shows an order book with quite a few contracts readily available for purchase, many of them priced at 0.1 cents which can pay out $1 to an attacker (1000x). It's difficult to determine exactly how much an attacker could make on Polymarket because it depends on a lot of factors and a moving market. But a 51% attacker might attempt something like this on the ""Presidential Election Winner 2024"" market ( https://polymarket.com/event/presidential-election-winner-2024 ):

* Buy ""Yes"" on Chris Christie. $0.001. Buy 72 million shares right now for $72k.
* Buy ""No"" on Trump over a few weeks or months. $0.42. Maybe accumulate 100 million shares for $42m
* Buy ""No"" on Kamala over a few weeks or months. $0.58. Maybe accumulate 100 million shares for $58m
* Accept the loss of $100m worth of UMA due to the price collapsing

**This would cost roughly $200m and make $272m.** They could make a bit more on the smaller betting markets as well. There's only about $670m of USDC on the Polygon network in total, which puts a hard limit on how much money exists in these contracts.

At the moment, at least, someone on these markets betting that Chris Christie is 99.9% likely to lose is not correctly pricing in the risk of a 51% attack on UMA.

There is a different play for someone with a lot more money and power to 51% attack UMA, and that would be to gain favor with Trump by using their 51% to decide Trump wins on the betting markets. It could be used to help the publicity battle that Trump will fight if he doesn't clearly win the election.

I would guess there's not quite enough money to be made just yet to justify a risky, expensive attempt to do a 51% attack on UMA, in large part because acquiring the 51% over the last few years would have cost the attacker a lot more than $100m (see historic prices). If anyone already did this, they're probably planning to hold on for something bigger. I'd put a small non-zero chance on a malicious actor already having acquired 51%.

So, in conclusion, the current market seems to be teetering on the edge. If UMA's market cap doesn't rise as fast as Polymarket's betting markets, Polymarket may need to switch to a voting network that they have 51% control over, or some other system that can't be readily abused.

Okay, this is weird. I just tried to set up a validator on Holesky testnet and noticed I'd have to wait 18 DAYS for activation. Double-checked the queue - there are [32,033 validators ](https://holesky.beaconcha.in)waiting. On a testnet! Something's definitely cooking...

What's even more interesting is that this massive queue started forming right after EIP-7002 (the beacon state root in the EVM proposal) hit the testnet. For those not familiar, this proposal essentially enables smart contracts to verify beacon chain state, which is crucial for many staking innovations.

Looking through some GitHub discussions and Discord channels, I've noticed a lot of activity around:

* DVT (Distributed Validator Technology) implementations
* Restaking protocols
* Liquid staking solutions
* New staking pool mechanisms

I'm particularly intrigued by the DVT testing activities because of the recent Lido simpleDVT and CSM discussions about implementing validator splitting into DVT solutions. Seeing projects like SSV and others actively testing on Holesky makes me wonder if we're closer to seeing production-ready DVT implementations than we think.

112,2024-10-31,"Ethereum won't reach real adoption until we solve the mobile wallets problem.# Here’s a quick story “from the trenches”. 

**First a bit of context:**

I guess most people here use crypto primarily via desktop wallets (like MetaMask). So you don’t use crypto the way you’d use Cash App or Revolut for everyday payments or 10 small txs per day.

But the truth is that people spend most of their non-work time on mobiles, scrolling YouTube, Instagram, or WhatsApp. So, if we want Ethereum to reach significant consumer adoption, our mobile experiences must be great because this is what people are used to, and troubleshooting stuff on mobile is very irritating. Plus most people in Asia and Africa are mobile-first. 

**Why do I even talk about it?**

So we've been building Kiwi for like 1.5 yrs. Our idea has been to stay open and Ethereum-aligned. This means that we haven’t set up “Sign in with Google” or embedded wallets powered by Privy, Capsule, and others. We haven’t even built an Android or Apple app - we have a PWA app so that everyone can use it.

Since our app is primarily focused on people reading and discussing Ethereum-related content, the mobile experience is very important for us. But unfortunately, mobile wallets just don’t work.

I've been flying around the world to attend conferences - from Istanbul to LA and saw people getting onboarded to our app. They used Rainbow, Coinbase Wallet, Metamask and many other wallets. 

Metamask basically doesn't work most of the time. Rainbow sometimes breaks down, too. Coinbase wallet used to be the best, but now they redirect people to create a passkey wallet, which is confusing.

And it’s not only Kiwi - many users have similar problems on established apps like Zora. Some just say: “Ah yeah, it’s normal. I will figure it out once I get in front of my laptop”. Can you imagine trying to onboard users to your app in these circumstances?

Last year, my co-founder even made a viral thread about testing different mobile wallets, and since then, not a lot has changed: [https://x.com/timdaub/status/1673591390687690753](https://x.com/timdaub/status/1673591390687690753)

And it’s not that the Ethereum community doesn’t care about the UX. Vitalik even said at one of his talks: “We should be as decentralized and open as Linux and Android, and at the same time have as consistent a user experience as Apple.”

But if Steve Jobs were still alive and saw what the hell is going on with our mobile wallet connections, he'd just ban crypto wallets from AppStore forever.

Wallets are something that needs to work 99.9999% of the time. You can't build consumer crypto apps - and have real adoption - when wallets work 80% of the time. But this is the sad reality that’s making the adoption much harder.

And the reason everyone is so excited about embedded wallets is because they go around these obvious bugs. But it's not a solution either because the dapp gets the vendor locked in, and the user has to create and send money to a new wallet without his identity and onchain history. And the whole idea is to have your ENS and onchain history in one place, in your hot wallet. 

The question is, why does it keep happening? Maybe because it's just complex - people use different browsers - from Firefox, through Chrome up to Opera - and wallets must be compatible with all of them. But then, how do the desktop wallets work 99.99% of the time?

If we had solved the Merge, I imagine we would have found a way to connect mobile wallets reliably. But it’s been 1.5 years now, and this mobile wallet connectivity problem is still omnipresent.",positive,0.88293886,61
113,2024-10-31,"Best practices for Anonymous Crypto Payment System With User Tracking and Minimal Gas FeeHello! I'm looking to implement a crypto payment system where users can deposit funds without logging in—ideally through a simple QR code scan or by pasting a wallet address. However, I still need a way to track each user and monitor their total deposits. 
The main requirements are: 
1. Users deposit anonymously without requiring login. 
2. The system needs to associate each deposit with a specific user ID for tracking purposes. 
3. I want to know how much each user has deposited over time. 
4. Ideally, I’d like to minimize gas fees and avoid dust deposits. 

Questions: 
1. Has anyone implemented a similar system or found ways to make anonymous deposits work while tracking users reliably? 
2. When scanning the QR code in MetaMask, the metadata field appears empty. Has anyone encountered this issue, and is there a workaround to pass data reliably with the QR code?
3. Would using smart contracts be feasible in this context? If so, how could I reduce gas fees and avoid creating dust amounts?

116,2024-10-30,"Help. Insanely high gas fees for a single transaction using Trust WalletYesterday I tried to make a payment, so I bought some USDC on Ethereum network and sent it to my Trust Wallet. I moved $650$ worth of USDC and paid about $4-5 in gas fee for the transaction. No biggie.

I decided to not make the payment after all, and now I want to send back the USDC so I can sell them, but TrustWallet wants over $130 of gas fees. (UPDATE: IT'S OVER 270 NOW.)

How is this possible? Am I doing something wrong? How could the transaction cost about $4 yesterday and over $130 today? 

Btw I checked multiple times during the day and the cost was always insanely high.

I mean I understand gas fees are dependant on congestion of ETH network but $130 for a single transaction?

How can I get my money back to Revolut without losing almost $140 just for sending it back and forth? This is insanity.

On Trust Wallet there are multiple options of selling my USDC directly but I don't know if they are trustworthy(MoonPay or Ramp).

EDIT:
The fee is about $270 now.  
Seriously, is Trust Wallet a scam? Am I overlooking something?

Even Swapping my USDC to ETH costs about $270. How could it cost 5$ yesterday, same ETH network, and today 270?

125,2024-10-29,"Zerion Wallet SWAP Redirected My Funds to an Unknown Address – Intentional Scam or Security Flaw?I’m posting this because **Zerion** wallet just cost me funds in what looks like either a major UI failure or worse: an intentional setup to siphon funds. After following **Zerion**’s instructions step-by-step, my swap transaction directed my assets to a **mystery address** without delivering any of the tokens I was supposed to receive. Here’s the rundown – and I’m curious if anyone else has seen their funds vanish this way.

# What Happened:

I attempted to **swap 160 SPX6900 for SOL** using **Zerion**, which recommended **1inch** as the swap provider. I followed the process exactly, hitting the **big SWAP button** multiple times until finally clicking **Sign and Send after the transaction had been verified safe by Zerion.** But instead of completing the swap, my funds were sent to an unknown address, leaving me with nothing in return.

# My Attempts to Resolve This:

* **The Support Deflection**: I sent **Zerion** the transaction hashes, multiple screenshots showing I used “**SWAP**” at each step, and even a full screen recording of the process. Their response? **“It looks like you accidentally chose ‘Send’ instead.”** Ridiculous. **Zerion** then claimed they couldn’t locate the transaction in their system, but that doesn’t explain why their UI sent my funds somewhere else.
* **External Verification**: After contacting **1inch**, they confirmed the swap was never initiated on their end, suggesting the issue is entirely with **Zerion**. **Zerion**’s UI directly led my assets to an unknown address, which they now disavow.

# My Concerns:

* **Is This Intentional?** The support deflection has me wondering if this is part of a deliberate strategy by **Zerion**. Directing funds to a side wallet that gathers small, seemingly “lost” amounts could easily go unnoticed or be written off by most users who don’t want the hassle. It feels like a setup, especially given the vague responses and deflection tactics I’m seeing.
* **Security Issue or Scam?** If **Zerion**’s swap function can so easily redirect funds without fulfilling the swap, how many other users have been unknowingly impacted? And what accountability is **Zerion** planning to take here? So far its been none. The burden of proof has fallen on me, the user, and even with providing ample evidence they remain willfully obtuse.
* **Passing the Burden**: When I pushed for answers, **Zerion** suggested I **risk more funds** to “reproduce the issue.” As if losing more money would magically solve this? This is a clear attempt to dodge responsibility instead of addressing the serious flaw (or scam) in their system.

If this is a UI bug, a security vulnerability, or worse an intentional scam **Zerion** needs to be held accountable, not sidestep responsibility and accountability. We’re trusting platforms like **Zerion** with our assets, and they have a duty to ensure their UI isn’t leading users straight into financial loss.",positive,0.6669205,3

130,2024-10-29,"Liberation from the taboo on price discussionsThe Ethereum community still seems to ignore or taboo discussions on price.

Even after the transition to POS, the equation of 'price = security' has been established for Ethereum.

In the debate with Bitcoin maximalists, the Ethereum community, including Vitalik, argued that the burning mechanism is better for increasing value than the fixed issuance amount.

This is also why Justin Drake's 'Ultra Sound Money' meme was born.

I think we need to discuss more seriously how to gradually increase the price of Ethereum. This is not just about making money. The goal is to make Ethereum the network with the strongest security and censorship resistance.

What Bitcoin has gained strong supporters for now is the guarantee of scarcity. The belief in the immutable issuance rules. In the case of Ethereum, the policy on the total issuance amount seems too vague. I think this is Ethereum's worst selling point.

I thought about several monetary policies.

1. Increase the burn fee when the target total issuance exceeds 100 million, and reduce the burn fee when it falls below, maintaining 100 million.

2. Burn all fees including MEV to create endless deflation. When the total issuance decreases to 50 million, split the coin in half. Then, the number of Ethers will be 50 million -> 100 million -> 50 million -> 100 million repeatedly. People get excited when companies like Tesla and Nvidia do Stocksplit.

3. Set the total issuance to 100 million, and stakers only get the fees.",positive,0.90804386,1

140,2024-10-26,"Basic Income and Ethereum: Different Paths, Shared VisionI’ve been thinking about how much /r/basicincome and /r/ethereum actually have in common. On the surface, they may seem like separate communities—one focusing on universal financial security and the other on blockchain technology—but at their core, they’re both pushing for something much bigger: a new, fairer way to organize society.

Both UBI and Ethereum are fundamentally about global cooperation through systems that are reliable, transparent, and accessible to everyone. They’re about creating a world where we don’t have to rely on centralized powers to uphold fairness; instead, we’re looking to decentralized, credibly neutral systems that we can all trust. It’s about reimagining how resources, influence, and value circulate across borders, using technology to realign incentives toward a more just and resilient society.

Money, when you think about it, is political. Every transaction, every dollar, every token is an influence, a ripple that spreads through society to sway opinions, move wallets, and ultimately shape reality. In a world where social media feels like an echo chamber, and where consent is constantly manufactured, the conversation about these ideas needs to go deeper—into the structures that uphold our shared reality.

For those interested in diving further into this vision, here’s a bit of inspiration from popular culture:

- **Arrival** – A film that shows how language, perception, and time itself can shift when we learn to see reality through a new lens.
- **Outlander** – A story of navigating history and power dynamics, reminding us that the structures of the past shape us today.
- **Mad Men** – A look at the influences and narratives crafted in the present day, showing how reality can be shaped by media and perception.
- **Devs** – A glimpse into a near-future where technology and consciousness intertwine, raising questions about determinism and the nature of reality itself.

These themes highlight that the way we organize, influence, and experience reality is constantly evolving. Basic Income and Ethereum represent two pathways that ultimately converge on the same goal: creating a more equitable and decentralized future.

I am aware that empirically, EIP1559 has improved the gas fee situation. However, I am just wondering why it works if folks can just set higher and higher max fees to get their transaction to succeed, resulting in the same problems as with Type 0/Legacy transactions.

I apologize if this has been asked before, I have tried to look around the internet but didn't get very far (or maybe just didn't get far enough down the search results). Most posts talk about how EIP1559 helps the situation by adjusting base fees predictably, but I fail to see why people don't just start ""bidding wars"" by setting high max fees.",positive,0.72366637,16

I checked last week and it fell to around 3%. That’s when I realized that I was losing out on a lot by not closely monitoring my Aave yield. If I’d known my yield had fallen by half, I would’ve switched to another Aave pool with higher yield or to another lending platform, like Moonwell or Maple.

I’ve recently noticed a lot of people posting about this same problem on other defi subreddits, so I wanted to share how setting up email alerts when my lending APY drops by a certain threshold has helped me better optimize my USDC and save time.

164,2024-10-21,"I can't understand L2 networks no matter whatSo my current understanding about roll-ups is that since eth gas fees are like really high per transaction, so it would be much better if the transactions are bundled and submitted as a single transaction , but like how does this work? say if we take optimism for example , like a lot of nodes are running for that particular L2 right and if I make a transaction to that network , it will be bundled with other transactions and submitted as a single transaction to the main network? is it like that? 


If say bob sends 1 eth to Alice , like how does this work on roll-ups , first the optimism nodes do the work on verifying stuffs like the balance and other and what do they do ? submit it to the main network? 


And how do they submit, like via rpc to a contract or smtn?


please help, I can't find a source that goes into technical details of this other than than blog posts saying what are L2s and how they fix the eth scaling issues.

Edit: It finally clicked for me , huge thanks to u/DepartedQuantity for helping me out.


So here's my understanding:

Till so far in my mind was that the rolling up is for the L1 transactions, since transaction fees are higher so send the transaction to a separate network and let them batch up multiple users transaction together with mine and submit it to the L1 as a single transaction with some proofs. And some smart contract does some magic and everything is good but it doesn't make any sense because someone either way has to pay to change the state on the main chain which is going to be really expensive. 


But the thing is that the L2 is a network own it's own with an evm and state changes and etc etc. Connected to the main chain with bridges so an equivalent on chain can be given in the other. And all the transactions happening out there is independent own its own and what it submits to the main network    are transactions details(or whatever) in L2 so if something ever happens to it , it can be recovered.


And not L1 transactions that are verified off-chain and submitted as a batch to the main chain.",positive,0.9136325,46

177,2024-10-18," Ethereum builder centralization and your contributionIn recent weeks, more than 90% of Ethereum blocks have been built by just two block builders: beaverbuild.org and titanbuilder.xyz. This trend is growing, and it’s likely these two will dominate nearly all block production soon, profiting massively from users transactions MEV. [https://www.relayscan.io/builder-profit?t=7d](https://www.relayscan.io/builder-profit?t=7d)

The driving force behind this centralization is XOF (private orderflow), as explained by Toni Wahrstätter on X: [https://x.com/nero\_eth/status/1846786871998759141](https://x.com/nero_eth/status/1846786871998759141)

So, where does this private orderflow originate?

For [titanbuilder.xyz](http://titanbuilder.xyz), it partly comes from BananaGunBot (https://x.com/BananaGunBot), as seen in blocks like this one: [https://etherscan.io/block/20959121](https://etherscan.io/block/20959121)

For [beaverbuild.org](http://beaverbuild.org), it comes from platforms like [mevblocker.io](http://mevblocker.io) (https://cow.fi/mev-blocker). Their FAQ states they submit to all major builders:

>MEV Blocker submits to all major block builders, including Builder0x69, f1b, Flashbots, rsync builder, Titan Builder, Gambit Labs, and Beaver Build.

But there is a catch: who created MEV Blocker? according to their FAQ:

>MEV Blocker is jointly formulated and maintained by CoW Protocol, Agnostic Relay, and Beaver Build. It is open to all searchers and block builders.

The last part seems questionable. With control over the order flow, who would rationally share most profitable or important transactions with competitors?

It gets worse: a bot operated by beaverbuild uses the same calldata as the notorious jaredfromsubway MEV bot (https://x.com/MevRefund/status/1835666845547815067), suggesting beaverbuild likely operates the jared bot. jaredfromsubway is known for sandwiching pretty much everything and everyone (https://etherscan.io/address/0x1f2f10d1c40777ae1da742455c65828ff36df387).

So, what’s my point? Avoid trading shitcoins, especially with BananaGun. And don’t use [mevblocker.io](http://mevblocker.io) (rather make sure you have set your slippage tolerance correctly), which appears to be little more than a hypocritical frontend for beaverbuild.

181,2024-10-18,"Lido's Simple DVT Module Surpasses Expectations—A Deeper Look at Distributed Validator Technology's Future in Ethereum StakingI’ve been keeping an eye on the recent developments with Lido’s Simple DVT module, and the numbers are impressive. Just recently, the module hit 2,250 validators and over 72,000 ETH staked, surpassing its initial 0.5% share limit, as noted by u/LidoFinance. Distributed Validator Technology (DVT) now powers around 0.75% of the entire Lido protocol. What’s even more interesting is how these DVT clusters are outperforming 8 out of the top 10 staking entities, according to u/ratedw3b.

This got me thinking: What does this mean for the future of Ethereum staking? thinking

For one, the decentralization of staking is clearly on the rise. DVT allows for a more robust and fault-tolerant staking infrastructure, reducing the risks associated with single points of failure. Projects like SSV Network and Obol Collective are really pushing the envelope here, making Ethereum staking more accessible and secure for both solo and community stakers. It’s awesome to see over 140 new solo and community stakers becoming node operators via DVT—this is a huge step toward decentralization.

But it also raises a bigger question: Could DVT be the key to breaking the dominance of large staking pools and making Ethereum more decentralized at the protocol level? thinking

SSV Network, in particular, has been at the forefront of this movement. By enabling secure and distributed validator setups, they are changing the game for both small-scale stakers and large operators. I can’t help but wonder how this will impact the wider Ethereum ecosystem, especially as staking becomes more fragmented and democratized.

Would love to hear what you all think—are we on the verge of a decentralization revolution in Ethereum staking, or is it too early to tell? ",positive,0.56082124,8

185,2024-10-17,"Domain Registrar Based on Smart Contracts# Project Concept

We propose creating a new type of domain registrar that uses smart contracts instead of traditional accounts to determine domain management rights.

# How It Works

1. When transferring a domain to this registrar, functions in the smart contract are called to add the new domain.
2. The address of the smart contract that has the rights to sign changes related to this domain is specified.

# Advantages

1. **Decentralized Management:** Domains do not depend on an individual's email.
2. **Flexible Management:** Ability to use multi-signature or DAO voting for decisions on DNS record changes.
3. **Security:** Use of cryptographic protection methods instead of passwords.
4. **Transparency:** All changes are recorded on the blockchain.

# Technical Implementation

1. **Integration with Existing DNS:** The service functions as a regular centralized registrar, fully compatible with the existing DNS infrastructure.
2. **Support for Popular Domains:** Ability to transfer and manage top-level domains (.com, .net, etc.).
3. **Auto-Renewal:** The system automatically renews domain registration by deducting funds from the smart contract.
4. **Open Balance Top-Up:** Any user can top up the contract balance for a specific domain without the need for authorization.

# Potential Applications

* For DAO projects
* For collaborative business projects
* For personal use (using a wallet instead of email for ownership confirmation)

# Questions for the Community

1. If such a project were implemented and announced by one of the top 10 existing domain registrars, would you use it for your new project?
2. Would you consider using this service for your personal domains?
3. What additional features would you like to see in such a service?

As a reminder the start of the transition to proof of stake started back in December 2020. The staking chain was launched then to run in parallel with the proof of work chain. Staking was then enabled, but withdrawals from staking were not. The proof of work chain and the proof of stake merged in September 2022, almost two years after the initial phase. Finaly unstaking was enabled in March 2023, when everyone who had staked on the PoS chain could unstake if they wish so.

Help scale Rocket Pool and support decentralized node operators!Hi r/ethereum, I’m one of the co-founders of NodeSet, the developer of [Constellation](https://nodeset.medium.com/project-hyperdrive-4819f22391dc), a “Layer 2” staking protocol built on top of Rocket Pool! 

The main innovations of Constellation are xrETH, a liquid ETH staking token with ZERO fees on Ethereum staking rewards (including MEV), and xRPL, a liquid staking token for RPL. Gravita is launching the first public Constellation deployment on mainnet today, and [minting these tokens is now available via the Gravita website!](https://app.gravitaprotocol.com/constellation/xreth)

Once minted, the Constellation contracts non-custodially distribute the assets among NodeSet’s hundreds of decentralized operators, funding the operator bond (currently 8 ETH + 2.4 ETH or RPL) and unlocking their ability to deploy RP validators at scale.

We’ve spent the last 18+ months building both a robust (250+) and vetted cohort of independent node operators, including solo stakers, Rocket Pool operators, and small staking businesses. NodeSet’s mission is to connect the long-tail of decentralized operators that make Ethereum the most credibly neutral settlement layer in the world to compute opportunities across the ecosystem. Constellation, our first major project, supports the protocol that got us started on our journey as a company, Rocket Pool. Over the last year, RP has faced scaling challenges due to its bonding requirements, which has resulted in contraction of the protocol. Constellation was designed to alleviate those challenges while improving Rocket Pool’s underlying asset distribution. With nearly 40,000 ETH sitting in the rETH deposit pool, it’s time to unleash Constellation and grow Ethereum’s most decentralized liquid staking protocol! 

For those interested in diving deeper into the technology, please [take a look at the Constellation documentation](https://docs.nodeset.io/constellation). There’s a lot of work remaining, but we will be adding more information over the coming weeks, and [the GPLv3 code is available on our GitHub](https://github.com/nodeset-org/constellation), of course. On the security side, we recently [concluded three audits from some of the best in the business](https://github.com/nodeset-org/constellation/tree/main/audits) like Chainsafe and Sigma Prime, and [our bug bounty program details are located in the documentation](https://docs.nodeset.io/constellation/security-information).

200,2024-10-15,"Upsides and Downsides of Lowering Ethereum's Solo Staking Requirement?The current solo staking system is for rich people. Most of us here dont have 32 ETH. Right now 32 ETH is $82 700 - only those with deep pockets can become validators because thats not even life savings for the average person. This of course excludes many average investors from helping secure the network directly

Vitalik posted yesterday in his blog the idea of dropping the staking requirement - He said as low as 1 ETH

Quoting:

>Ideally, we want to preserve economic finality, while simultaneously improving on the status quo in two areas:

>1 Finalize blocks in one slot (ideally, keep or even reduce the current length of 12s), instead of 15 min

>2 Allow validators to stake with 1 ETH (down from 32 ETH)

As someone who wishes to become a validator I think this is good and bad. Making staking accessible to more people would pump participation and decentralization - But is this ideal???

The first downside is the impact on yields - With more validators joining rewards would decrease by a lot - making solo staking less profitable. This would also dilute the incentives for maintaining nodes - which could result in less security if validators lose interest because of the lower returns. On the flip side decentralization would increase with more people participating - not just whales. There would be less reliance on staking pools - Lido for example

More participants means a more resilient network but this is at the cost of validator quality and security

The staking requirement should drop a little so it gives smaller investors a chance - not just the rich - but it should be something higher like 10 ETH. This way the network wouldnt be trading validator rewards for participation and decentralization and security would be maintained and the yields wouldnt be so low",positive,0.72598207,8

This command results in an `Invalid API Key` error. Which is expected because I put `https://zksync2-mainnet-explorer.zksync.io/contract_verification` for `--etherscan-api-key`.

Hello, I needed access to my Coinbase account so I could pull tax documents and filled out the form for someone to contact me because Coinbase don’t have a number listed. Within a minute I was contacted by someone by the name of Ryan Roy stating he was with Coinbase support. It seemed like he had quite a bit of information and nothing seemed out of place so he assisted us over the course of a week to get the issue resolved. He would help us get verified and walked us thru everything and said he needed to get the right computers linked up and that we had to many currently linked which is why we were always getting locked out of our account. He was able to name the computers connected to the account and we needed to make sure each computer was verified. He worked with us for a while for a week.

217,2024-10-12,"Can layer 2 scalability really undermine Ethereum’s value?Lately, I’ve been seeing more and more posts, mostly on X, explaining why, in their opinion, it’s now certain that the price of ETH can only go down. 

Their argument is that Ethereum’s scalability, based on L2, leads to a growing reduction in users who rely on L1, and that the fees paid by L2s to L1 are extremely low (almost free), which translates into lower revenues for L1. So if the L2s roadmap plays out, it would basically result in a divergence between Ethereum L1 utility (increasing by number of users on L2s settling on Ethereum) and ETH price (decreasing by lower fees geenrated for L1).

Another argument that’s often heard is that the most successful L2s in the medium/long term will completely detach from Ethereum, becoming independent L1s and taking their user base with them.

Regarding this last argument, I find it unlikely since the value of Ethereum lies precisely in its degree of decentralization and censorship resistance, and that’s not something L2s can easily achieve overnight. So, unless an L2 wants to become a centralized L1 like others, it wouldn’t make sense to detach from Ethereum.

As for the first argument, the issue of fees paid by L2s to settle transactions on L1 is definitely relevant. Currently, they are very low, but that doesn’t mean it can’t change in the future. After all, Ethereum’s main value is to provide a decentralized, censorship-resistant layer for settling transactions. Being the only chain with these characteristics, aside from perhaps Bitcoin, Ethereum L1 should charge appropriate fees to L2s for settlement.

summary ↓

an exploration of the commons scale goods that make Ethereum (network, asset, media), what underpins their integrity, and how [u/ProtocolGuild](https://x.com/ProtocolGuild) can help with that

Ethereum is a commons like the natural + digital ones that precede it: fisheries, forests, the internet, Linux, etc. Commons are productive systems which create resources for collective benefit

https://preview.redd.it/fn8akvk03ytd1.png?width=2400&format=png&auto=webp&s=f0513922a6950641fdbb2763d2c5eeb9c9b51a31

Ethereum's three shared resources: network, asset, media

their confluence produces what we call Ethereum mainnet: they are deeply interdependent here, but altered forms make the edges of the broader commons

these resources are produced through protocols: technical, legal, economic, social, political

complete ownership of each resource is not desirable, as it destroys their integrity. therefore, actors engage in production for influence extraction

Protocol Guild gives us a transparent, legible, sustainable and accountable funding allocation mechanism for software media production. there are 5 main threads which make it unique:

1. narrow mandate
2. broad self-curation
3. members are individuals
4. 4yr onchain vesting contract
5. designed with time in mind

it holistically funds stewardship of the entire watershed - not rivers in isolation

Commons have had a rough go under capitalism - but there is hope in long-lived natural precedents: irrigation, fisheries, farming.

blossoming digital commons should practice the posture and develop the mechanisms necessary to ensure uncaptured longevity

Since blobs got introduced and regular users moved to L2s, there are way lower gas fees in the Ethereum ecosystem. Time to celebrate, right?
The downside of this is a constantly increasing ETH supply and the fear, that ETH isn't seen as a good investment anymore. I know that inflation of Bitcoin is still higher rn but Bitcoins supply is capped, while ETHs is infinite.

Imo it is important for ETH to be seen as a store of value (besides all it's functionality) to attract new users. There is also the risk of the old users slowly fading away, because they feel this spiral of: less new users > more supply > falling price.

# For those who don’t know about Groth16 :

By convention, public portions of the witness are the first ℓ elements of the vector **a**. To make those elements public, the prover simply reveals them :

\[*a₁*,*a₂*,…,*a*ℓ\]

For the verifier to test that those values were in fact used, verifier must carry out some of the computation that the prover was originally doing.

Specifically, the prover computes :

[Sorry, but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/pqdtempzezsd1.png?width=536&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2d7fe92e26b9b8bab9961ae693dc8176c663d6f)

Note that only the computation of **\[C\]₁** changed -- the prover only uses the **a**i and Ψ*i* terms ℓ+1 to **m**.

The verifier computes the first ℓ terms of the sum:

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/f0gz8tjrfzsd1.png?width=279&format=png&auto=webp&s=55b2f75d4cb2f4473865f085c1e9146db3d390f1)

And the ᴇɪᴘ‒197 equation in the case of Ethereum on Fp^(12) is : 1?=\[*A*\]₁∙\[*B*\]₂×\[*α*\]₁∙\[*β*\]₂×\[*X*\]₁∙*G₂*×\[*C*\]₁∙*G*₂

# Part 2 : Separating the public inputs from the private inputs with γ and δ

# The first attack described in the tutorial I read and how it’s said to be prevented :

The assumption in the equation above is that the prover is only using Ψ(ℓ+1) to Ψ*m* to compute **\[C\]₁**, but nothing stops a dishonest prover from using Ψ**₁** to Ψℓ to compute **\[C\]₁**, leading to a forged proof.

For example, here is our current ᴇɪᴘ‒197 verification equation :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/676myt4ckzsd1.png?width=639&format=png&auto=webp&s=56d7cc9cab9a3ff25bb694d27ac4478677a0fbd8)

If we expand the C term under the hood, we get the following :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/hizdviiblzsd1.png?width=906&format=png&auto=webp&s=8cf492ad7210dcbebdc1676fbdb1c2f57422d191)

Suppose for example and without loss of generality that a=\[1,2,3,4,5\] and ℓ=3. In that case, the public part of the witness is \[1,2,3\] and the private part is \[4,5\].

The final equation after evaluating the witness vector would be as follows :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/53rakghanzsd1.png?width=963&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1bbc018b64cc369762ef66360066cecb50a5314)

However since the discrete logarithm between the public and private point in ***G₂*** is 1, nothing stops the prover from creating an valid portion of the public witness as \[1,2,0\] and moving the zeroed out public portion to the private part of the computation as follows :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/2723fvcbqzsd1.png?width=837&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc5a504fc6951399e84d8929ded37a2d9cc9f483)

The equation above is valid, but the witness does not necessarily satisfy the original constraints.

Therefore, we need to prevent the prover from using Ψ**₁** to Ψℓ as part of the computation of **\[C\]₁**.

# Introducing γ and δ :

To avoid the problem above, the trusted setup introduces new scalars γ and δ to force Ψℓ+1 to Ψ*m* to be separate from Ψ**₁** to Ψℓ. To do this, the trusted setup divides (multiplies by the modular inverse) the private terms (that constitute **\[C\]₁**) by γ and the public terms (that constitute **\[X\]₁**, the sum the verifier computes) by δ.

Since the ***h***(***τ***)***t***(***τ***) term is embedded in **\[C\]₁**, those terms also need to be divided by γ.

[Again, no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/ua70vela30td1.png?width=613&format=png&auto=webp&s=f45e24b58202d9ae03c5ccf6ca405c6183374dfc)

**A Quarter of Anniversaries: 2 years since Merge and 1 Year with First Non-custodial Pooled ETH Staking Solution**

In the third quarter of this year, we celebrated a significant milestone: 2 years since Ethereum’s historic Merge.

On September 15, 2022, Ethereum successfully transitioned from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) to a PoS consensus mechanism, fundamentally transforming ETH's tokenomics. This monumental upgrade not only enhanced the deflationary attributes of Ethereum but also drastically reduced its carbon footprint, aligning the network's commitment to sustainable growth.

Following the Merge and Shapella, we observed a notable decrease in #ETH issuance alongside a remarkable increase in staking participation.

The Merge represents one of the most critical upgrades in Ethereum's roadmap, marking a pivotal step toward enhancing both sustainability and scalability within the ecosystem.

https://preview.redd.it/33gtnpdf7psd1.png?width=1943&format=png&auto=webp&s=42da675ea3e71c74f71a7b294b547888e8219be3

**The mid-September was marked by the 1st anniversary of the first non-custodial pooled ETH staking solution, powered by Everstake.**

As the transition of Ethereum to a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism sparked widespread interest in staking, the requirement of **32 ETH** to launch a validator turned out to be a significant barrier for many potential participants.

Everstake has solved this issue by reducing the entry threshold by **320 times**, thereby enabling broader participation in staking activities. Our **non-custodial**, non-liquid staking solution allows users to engage in Ethereum staking with just **0.1 ETH**, and we take pride in being the first to facilitate this opportunity.

 [x.com/eth\_everstake/status/1835727776201994603](http://x.com/eth_everstake/status/1835727776201994603)

**Staking Dynamics and Slashing-Free Months**

Staking participation in the Ethereum network continues to grow, reflecting continued confidence among users. Staking metrics dashboard below shows a significant increase in the total amount of staked $ETH, underscoring the community's commitment to securing the network.

In August, we achieved a remarkable milestone, surpassing 34 million ETH staked on the Ethereum mainnet. Currently, there are 1.07 million active validators, with approximately 28.58% of the circulating supply staked.

https://preview.redd.it/27v4vnot7psd1.png?width=1943&format=png&auto=webp&s=b81a5affae875d471ec496c3bd7b0787ff164a91

At the end of July and early August, the validator entry queue was notably lengthy, likely driven by the surge of interest in Ethereum surrounding the ETF launch. Conversely, the exit queue remained consistently short, indicating a strong community sentiment toward active participation in staking.

https://preview.redd.it/od2439cw7psd1.png?width=831&format=png&auto=webp&s=28d6880c119f87aa378e87fddaed614d320d9345

As of now, Ethereum nodes are distributed across 89 countries, highlighting the global nature of the network. The countries with the highest number of Ethereum nodes are the United States with over 3k nodes (31.11%), Germany with 2k nodes (18.08%), Finland with 840 nodes (7.40%), France with 585 nodes (5.16%) and the United Kingdom with 415 nodes (3.66%).

This distribution reflects Ethereum's decentralized infrastructure and its widespread adoption, with Germany and Finland in top-3 thanks to their reliable data centers provided for operators across the world. For those interested in exploring Ethereum’s nodes distribution, check out more here:

In Q3, the Ethereum network experienced a notable stretch without any slashing events, lasting approximately 68 days in a row during the quarter. This achievement reflects the dedication of validators committed to maintaining the security and integrity of the network.

The last time we saw the same 50-day gap was in May, indicating a positive trend moving forward.

# Ethereum Spot ETF Inflows and Outflows Roller-coaster

On July 23, 2024, after receiving final approval from the SEC, 8 different spot Ethereum ETFs started trading.

It's been an up-and-down period with significant inflows and outflows. Since its launch, Ethereum ETFs saw total positive inflows of $2,383.5 billion, a notable indicator of interest and confidence in the asset.

Despite the positive inflows, ETHE has a substantial influence on the broader ETF landscape, with an overall net negative flow of $523.4 million. The Grayscale Ethereum Trust is an exchange-traded product distinct from its Mini Trust ETF. The market price of ETHE can differ from its net asset value, offering interested parties potential premiums or discounts on Ether holdings.

https://preview.redd.it/dqp5fvz28psd1.png?width=1571&format=png&auto=webp&s=d63704521e3ed7665d2e399890480a06172db182

At the beginning, we experienced significant daily outflows, but currently, we can admit the lower dynamic of outflows, highlighting a positive trend for its future growth. This is an encouraging sign for market participants, as fewer outflows reflect growing conviction and holding strength among users.

As for the key leader, BlackRock took the lead, driving $1,146.1 billion of the total inflows. Fidelity and Bitwise followed with $478.5M and $326.7M, respectively. These figures underscore the ongoing interest, signaling long-term belief in Ethereum’s value and utility. 

BlackRock’s spot Ethereum ETF (ETHA) has seen slower growth than its Bitcoin counterpart, but Robert Mitchnick, the company’s head of digital assets, remains optimistic about its long-term prospects, especially considering its rapid accumulation of assets under management. He mentioned that for BlackRock, Bitcoin, and Ethereum offer complementary benefits rather than competing for the same role.

# Blobs and Gas Changes

It’s been over 6 months since EIP-4844, or proto-danksharding, was successfully implemented on the Ethereum mainnet during the Dencun upgrade. At the end of Q3, the Ethereum network reached a significant milestone: **3 million blobs processed**, a testament to the steady progress of Ethereum’s data availability scaling.

https://preview.redd.it/372uelnb8psd1.png?width=1943&format=png&auto=webp&s=0cc835534587fbd1627c3ab82729c45685120bc4

These figures highlight the effectiveness of Ethereum’s scaling efforts, particularly in how blobs are helping to ensure that Ethereum remains the preferred network for Layer 2 (L2), despite growing demand for data availability.

However, while these numbers are impressive, discussions in Q3 2024 have increasingly focused on scaling challenges and future improvements to meet the ever-growing demand from L2 networks.

During the recent All Core Developers Consensus (ACDC) call, the conversation shifted toward Ethereum’s current blob capacity and whether it’s sufficient for the rapid growth of L2s. Base developer presented a proposal to increase blob capacity in the upcoming Pectra 1 upgrade, arguing that the current 3 target blobs per block will soon be inadequate for future scaling needs.

Discussions around low gas and blobs’ impact on it did not subside, as well. But, it is worth mentioning that without the scaling benefits brought by blobs, activity may have shifted to other L1 networks, leading to a far worse scenario than Ethereum’s current challenges around reduced fees.

Although there’s currently an imbalance between rollup earnings and Ethereum, as L1, revenue, this is seen as a temporary issue. The Ethereum community anticipates that blobs will eventually realize its benefits to the fullest, revealing the true dynamics of the system once retail demand returns. With fees currently low, Ethereum remains accessible, and once demand increases, L2s will be prepared to fulfil this interest.

So, the discussions around blob are ongoing, with developers focused on finding the right balance between meeting scaling demands and maintaining network stability.

**Pectra Split**

In September, Ethereum Core Developers decided to split the upcoming Pectra upgrade into two phases due to developers limited capacity resources and several challenges to deliver a reliable state of the network post-upgrade that emerged during preparation. This will allow to bring the first phase of the upgrade as soon as possible to address current Ethereum issues. The decision was not an easy one—it was followed a period of intense and lengthy discussions surrounding the Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) to be included in Pectra, with the list undergoing multiple revisions along the way.

Upgrade scoping is usually the first bottleneck in the preparation. Every time core devs need to carefulyl balance between multiple priorities. On one side, they must take into account community and user expectations. On the other, they need to consider the developer capabilities of client teams and the long-term vision for Ethereum's development. This balance-boarding is particularly complex as different client teams may prioritize EIPs differently based on their technical readiness or implementation challenges.

Read more on why is deciding on the Ethereum upgrade scope so challenging:

 [x.com/eth\_everstake/status/1839229193961246851](http://x.com/eth_everstake/status/1839229193961246851)

In Pectra, a prime example of this prioritization exercize is the EOF exclusion out of the Pectra phase one. Although highly anticipated by the community, at the end of the day EOF was not included due to its incomplete readiness for mainnet deployment, resulting in disappointment both across the community and client teams.

Developer Alex Stokes pointed out that excluding EOF from the first phase of Pectra would actually speed up the release of the 8 EIPs already in Pectra Devnet 3. By focusing on the more ""ready"" EIPs, developers can deliver improvements faster without compromising the overall timeline.

As the Pectra upgrade moves through its phased approach, these discussions underscore the intricacies involved in Ethereum's improvement and ensure that Ethereum continues to adapt to user needs while maintaining a robust technical foundation. 

The last months of 2024 will show us the final preparation process for the first part of the Pectra upgrade. Stay tuned!",positive,0.587755,21
259,2024-10-04,"I got hacked and stolen $45K off my walletI’m a video editor/programmer who with another guy online started to develop an editing tool that we were planning on selling. We had already started developing the tool and I knew the guy enough to have some trust in him (nothing beyond online).

About 3 weeks ago, he sent me a version of the tool that he wanted me to test and I downloaded it on my computer which had the key to metamask wallet (I know it’s dumb I don’t need to be lectured about it I know). That’s how he managed to get it from there, keep in mind the ""version"" of the tool he made me download didn’t work it had an error when showing up which he said he would fix and send me another one when he does so I didn’t think any of it.

A few days passed by and he was starting to ghost me a little bit, but we were still communicating about the tool and I worked on it, until I got on my metamask wallet and saw my balance completely emptied (almost all the money I owned gone). I confronted him about it because I knew it could only be him at that point and he denied everything until he blocked me/deleted his discord account. I tried to look for every way to possibly get my money back but it’s gone and there is really nothing much I can do.

I can’t eat, I can’t sleep and I can’t go to school ever since I lost the money. I don’t know what I’m gonna do from there, I’m only 19 that’s a lot of money for me and I was supposed to go to University next year using a large chunk of that money but now all of that is gone. I’m really at a point where I want to give up on life.

-throwaway account, I’m truly ashamed of myself

EDIT: I will try to take legal actions but I really don't expect anything, as for the people saying I should have had a hardware wallet, I know. I also saw a lot of people claiming I was rich which is hilarious, I'm an immigrant from Senegal to Canada my parents are middle class workers (Accountant and Oceanographer) that struggled to give us good life opportunities so yes $45K is a lot of money. This is a part of the money I've invested being a video editor and held in ETH since 2-3 years, I'm not rich. Thank you for everyone sending me nice words of support, I needed that.

EDIT 2: I bought a Ledger wallet to stock the BTC I had on another hot wallet, I’m not making the same mistake again. I want to thank you guys again for the nice/wise words my brothers and sisters, it has helped cope a bit better with my situation although I still feel horrible about the whole thing. As for the ETH it’s gone, I don’t think I’ll ever see it again and although I still have a bit of money left, I’ll have to make it all over again but as some of you guys said I’ve done it once I can do it again and better.",neutral,0.5212762,349

If not, how to rework the Groth16 protocol in order to let verifier ditching a pairing e(C,vk) when calling the precompile as a gas saving measure ?The non degeneracy criteria is there’s no bilinear pairing resulting in the finite field element 1 equivalent.

In the case of the optimal ate pairing, this can happen if one of the point of the pairing is the point at infinity : then whatever is the other point in the key, the result will always be 1.  
For that reason, Zcash prevent the prover from fully controlling proof inputs and thus provide no encodings for the point at infinity.

On Ethereum, the prover often can set without filters A ; B ; C. And the only check in ᴇɪᴘ‑197 is points must be on curves and implementations just skip the compultation of bilinear parings containing a point at infinity : as long as the end result is 1 in $F_q¹²$, the contract call can succeed even with 1 or 3 points at infinity $(0,0)$

But what would happen if it would be the cases as it’s happening on some implementation that use the Ethereum’s ᴇɪᴘ‐197 precompile ?

This could work to some extent if the data types don't share similar encoding rules. For example if the function is buyWETHwithUSDC(address, uint256, uint256, address)

282,2024-09-27," Meet EtherSnek: The Cosmic Snake of the Ether Hey everyone! 

I was thinking about how to explain Ethereum and blockchain to kids, and it hit me: there's a giant world snake hanging out in the Ether! Let me introduce you to EtherSnek, who slithers through the tubes of the internet, quietly eating up data in a way that's fair and trusted by everyone.

Here's how it works:

EtherSnek lives in the digital ether, and every 14 seconds, he opens his mouth and consumes a blob of data—people’s transactions, smart contracts, anything important. Once he swallows it, he never forgets. It’s locked in his belly forever. And you can ask the snake, ""Hey, what did you eat for dinner?"" and he'll tell you the truth, every time, exactly the same way. This makes it so everyone can trust the snake. No one can trick or alter what he’s already eaten.

We all trust the snake because no one can make him lie. But to get him to eat your data, you need to pay a little bit of Ether—it’s like special snake food. And if you help keep EtherSnek strong by participating in the network, he’ll reward you with Ether. It’s like feeding the snake and getting back a sSnek ssnack in return! 

EtherSnek is like the old piggy bank we used to have, but digital and alive. Instead of storing coins, he stores data blobs, and you can always trust that your data is safe. No one can steal it or change it. He’s constantly moving forward, consuming data at a steady rhythm, and no one can stop or slow him down.

This magical snek is how we know how much money everyone has, how smart contracts stay honest, and how trust is built in this digital world. The more we feed him, the more he grows, and the more secure Ethereum becomes. 

TL;DR: Ethereum is like a giant world snake (EtherSnek) that swallows data every 14 seconds and never forgets. You can trust the snake because no one can change what it's eaten, and it rewards you for helping keep it healthy!",positive,0.88567424,1

The following is based on my understanding from YouTube, ChatGPT, and other resources. If there are any inaccuracies, please feel free to correct and enlighten me. Also I used AI to restructured my Question to make it readable as English is not my first language. Thank You.

One of my friends is a fairly popular artist/singer on Instagram with around 30k followers. Recently, he needed funds to host a concert but didn't have the necessary resources. After brainstorming, I came up with an idea, and I’d like some input on its feasibility:

# Concept:

* **Create a Token**: We would create a token in my friend's name.
* **Hold 50% of Tokens**: We plan to keep around 50% of the tokens ourselves to prevent any major ""pump and dump"" scenarios.
* **Token Purchase by Fans**: Fans could buy the tokens, increasing their value over time.
* **Monetize Gradually**: Once the token price rises, we can sell or swap some of our tokens to fund the concert or other projects.
* **Provide Value to Fans**: To add stability and real value, we would offer physical merchandise, delivered to fans who hold the tokens.

# Challenges:

1. **Avoiding Pump and Dump**: I'm concerned about whales or large investors manipulating the token’s price. How can we prevent this?
2. **Not Promoting as Get-Rich-Quick**: We want to ensure this isn’t marketed as a way to ""get rich"" but more of a long-term investment in the artist.
3. **Legal Concerns (Securities)**: Since people are essentially investing in the artist, could this be considered a security? If so, what are the potential legal implications?

# Social Tokens:

* During my research, I came across the term **Social Tokens**, which seems to fit this concept. However, I noticed that they aren't very popular or stable.
* **Question**: Why haven’t social tokens gained more traction? Are there fundamental flaws in the concept?
* **Improvement**: Could we modify or recreate the idea with certain adjustments to make it more viable?

I have a detailed plan in mind, but I would love some insights or suggestions on how to proceed, particularly around the challenges mentioned above.",positive,0.89274186,0

And with that 1% difference, there isn't an amount to arbitrage with that results in a profit. When the expenses are $200 for transaction fees, interest on the flash loan and the slippage I make for myself.

# Current Situation or Status Praesens

On Ethereum, there are two main types of accounts: Contract Accounts and Externally Owned Accounts (EOA).

EOAs are regular user accounts. Every action on the blockchain requires a transaction, initiated and paid for by an EOA. EOAs are controlled by private keys, which are used to create a signature proving ownership of the account.

Contract accounts, however, are controlled by code instead of a private key. These accounts can’t initiate actions independently but can respond to transactions from EOAs. While they can’t directly pay for gas fees, they’re highly programmable and can perform a wide range of operations.

# Why the Current Setup Falls Short (Lacunas do Sistema Atual)

**Unfriendly Onboarding Experience**  
The true challenge of Web3 lies in its usability. Before users can even unlock the door to decentralized realms, they must first navigate a labyrinth of complexities, where each step presents a new hurdle. To use a dApp, one has to go through multiple steps, including creating a wallet, securing seed phrases, navigating exchanges, and paying gas fees. This complexity makes it challenging to engage seamlessly with Web3 applications.

**Poor Security**  
Relying solely on private keys for account access poses significant risks. If lost or stolen, access to both your account and funds is gone. Multi-signature smart contract wallets provide some security, but the default remains inflexible, leaving users vulnerable to theft or hacks.

**Requirement of ETH Balance**  
Ethereum transactions typically demand payment in ETH for gas fees. However, account abstraction allows gas fees to be paid with any ERC-20 token, making transactions more flexible and accessible. Additionally, anyone can cover gas fees for users’ transactions, removing the requirement for users to hold an ETH balance.

**Difficulty in Batching Transactions**  
In traditional EOAs, each transaction requires individual approval and authorization, which can be time-consuming, especially for frequent transactions like gaming. Account abstraction streamlines this process, allowing multiple transactions to be bundled into a single authorization, making transactions smoother and more convenient.

With these challenges in mind, let’s explore how account abstraction addresses them and unlocks new possibilities in the world of cryptocurrency.

# The Solution — Account Abstraction (El Remedio)

Account abstraction, in essence, is about enhancing smart contract wallets to function more like traditional wallets but with additional flexibility and capabilities. In traditional setups, wallets such as Metamask enable users to send transactions directly to the blockchain. However, with account abstraction, there’s a blending of roles between Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) and smart contracts, making smart contract wallets more robust.

**User Perspective**  
From the users’ standpoint, account abstraction simplifies the intricate workings of Ethereum accounts. It enhances user security, mitigates the risk of loss/theft, and makes it easier and more intuitive for users to interact with dApps.  
By managing complexity behind the scenes, account abstraction makes blockchain technology more accessible and user-friendly.

**Technical Setup in Ethereum & other EVMs**  
In Ethereum and other EVM chains, all blockchain activity must be initiated by an EOA, which limits the usability of smart contract accounts. **Native account abstraction** in newer protocols like zkSync and StarkNet removes this limitation (account abstraction at the protocol level).

ERC-4337 introduces account abstraction, transforming user accounts into smart contracts. This eliminates the need for managing private keys directly, enhancing security and usability.

Key features include:

* **User Operation Objects:** These encapsulate transaction details.
* **Bundlers:** External entities that aggregate multiple user operations into a single transaction, improving efficiency.

This decoupling of user intent from transaction execution simplifies user operations while maintaining decentralization.

Here’s a breakdown of how it works, particularly under the ERC-4337 standard:

**User Operations and the Alternative Mempool:** Instead of submitting traditional transactions, users create ‘user operations’ and submit them to an alternative Mempool. This allows for greater customization in how transactions are processed.

**Bundlers:** Bundlers validate and aggregate multiple user operations into a single transaction. They check for proper signatures and authorization before bundling operations, which reduces transaction costs and improves efficiency.

**Bundled Operations and the Contract Wallet:** Once bundled, these operations are sent to a contract wallet through a central contract known as the entry point (The entry point contract coordinates the validation of user operations, communication with the contract wallet, and interactions with bundlers and paymasters, maintaining the system’s integrity and smooth operation). The contract wallet receives and prepares to execute the bundled operations.

**Permissionless Bundling:** Anyone, including miners and validators, can become a bundler. This permissionless nature encourages decentralization and wider participation.

**Miners and Validators:** These actors participate in mining and validating the bundled user operations, ensuring security and integrity within the alternative Mempool.

**Execution and Payment:** Upon validation, the contract wallet executes the operations and handles payment, either in Ether or converted tokens. Some bundle transactions where gas is sponsored by 3rd party go via Paymaster (can sponsor gas fees, enabling dApps to cover users’ gas costs).

# Benefits of Account Abstraction (Beneficios)

**Enhanced Security:** With account abstraction, developers can introduce various options for account authentication and recovery, providing better security measures. Users can set spending limits, create whitelisted accounts, or freeze accounts as needed, adding layers of protection against potential threats. For example, you could set up a daily transaction limit to prevent large unauthorized transfers, establish recovery options for your account, or set rules for multi-signature transactions where multiple approvals are required before a transaction is processed.

**Walletless Web3 Logins:** With account abstraction, users can interact with dApps without needing a cryptocurrency wallet. Instead, they can authenticate using alternative methods such as social media accounts or email.

**Batching Transactions:** Account abstraction enables the bundling of multiple transactions into a single transaction. This feature is useful for executing multiple trades on a DEX and/or making batch payments.

**Automation:** AA opens avenues for automation and customization not possible with the current EOA system. Users can customize transactions and automate recurring payments, streamlining processes and improving efficiency. For example, you could set up a smart contract that automatically pays your rent or other recurring expenses on a specific date.

**Gas Fees:** dApps or smart contracts can be programmed to cover the gas fees for users’ transactions. This feature lowers the barrier to entry for new users. While sponsoring gas fees is helpful, it may not always be economically viable. Another option is to allow users to pay for gas fees using ERC20 tokens. This provides flexibility and convenience for users.

# Conclusion (Conclusie)

Account abstraction is a major advancement in simplifying blockchain and cryptocurrency. Replacing traditional wallets with smart contract wallets can offer a user experience as convenient and secure as Web2 applications while maintaining Web3 principles like self-custody and decentralization.

The use cases mentioned provide merely a glimpse of account abstraction’s potential. As this technology evolves and integrates more deeply into the blockchain ecosystem, new possibilities will emerge. This will lead to more sophisticated, user-friendly, and secure dApps, driving broader adoption and innovation.

Till then, stay safe with your keys & wallets!

I’ve been thinking about the whole “not your keys, not your funds” philosophy, and while I agree with it, I also feel like there’s room for added security, especially when it comes to fund recovery and preventing fraud.

What if we implemented KYC for wallets, but without compromising decentralization? 

Here’s what I’m thinking:

1. KYC data stored in decentralized storage (e.g., IPFS, Filecoin) instead of traditional databases. That way, no central authority holds your personal data.


2. Use Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZK proofs) to verify users without actually exposing their identity. This means users could prove ownership or compliance without revealing any personal information—maintaining privacy and transparency.


3. The focus is not on managing private keys, but on fund recovery in case of hacks or scams, and ensuring more transparency in the system without adding centralized control.



In my opinion, this would add an extra layer of security and verifiability without compromising on decentralization or privacy. It could also help with anti-money laundering (AML) efforts and offer a way to recover funds without needing full central control.

What do you all think? Could this work as a decentralized, privacy-preserving solution to improve wallet security and fund recovery? Or do you think it’s still too centralized, even with decentralized storage and ZK proofs?

I'm stills new to the space.

============================================================================

# Introduction

The Celsius bankruptcy has impacted hundreds of thousands of people. While many are happy to have received distributions, the tax impact is quite complex. I have scraped the internet looking for a reputable and comprehensive guide detailing exactly how to handle the distributions. **To my surprise, I have not found a guide that is both reputable and comprehensive.** All reputable guides are over simplified, gatekeeping the actual details of the complex calculation, and all detailed guides are generally not reputable and contain errors.

I'm here to set the record straight and provide an in-depth guide to calculating the tax impact of the Celsius bankruptcy and subsequent distributions based on my interpretation of the guidance. This will be a long post, but will contain the granular details needed for any of you looking to perform this calculation on your own.

For context, my name is Justin and I am a CPA specializing in crypto taxation. Without further adieu, let's begin.

# Ponzi Scheme vs Capital Loss Route

There are two options for claiming a loss here. (1) Ponzi scheme loss and (2) Capital loss.

1. The Ponzi Scheme Loss results in 75% of your cost basis of assets lost being claimed as a loss in 2023, with 25% being reserved to offset future distributions of any assets reclaimed. Any distributions received in excess of that 25% reserved will be taxed as ordinary income. This calculation is very simple, however requires that you claim it this year. So unless you are on extension, it may be too late. Additionally, this route comes with a major risk. About 50% of returns that claim a Ponzi scheme loss are subject to audit. Sometimes the risk is worth the benefit, but in many instances its not.
2. The Capital Loss route is a much more complicated calculation, however does not have the extra audit risk. Any loss due will be claimed in 2024 and future years where distributions are made (or it's finalized that no further distributions will be made).

For purposes of today's post, **I will be focusing on the Capital Loss route** and how to calculate the tax impact of the distributions given that the majority of people will fall into this bucket and likely haven't begun to think about this calculation yet since it won't be required to be made until 2024 tax filing in April 2025.

# Calculating Your Cost Basis

Without have the detailed information on your cost basis of the assets lost on Celsius, it is impossible to calculate your loss. **Full stop.** We'll discuss more in the section below titled ""Understanding Your Maximum Loss"", but for starters it is important to understand your cost basis is the most important factor when determining your loss. It is, quite literally, impossible to calculate without having the detail tax lot cost basis information for the assets lost on Celsius.

In order to get your cost basis, you need to **reconcile your whole account in a crypto tax software.** And I mean *everything*. Load all of your wallets and all of your exchanges into a software and make sure you get 100% (even wallets or exchanges you don't use anymore). **My firm uses Koinly for 99% of our clients**. It is one of the best, has a great UI, and robust features that allow us to finesse transactions as needed to ensure they are being accounted for correctly.

**Once you are loaded into the software, make sure you reconcile your transactions! While** softwares will pick up on a good amount of the transactions, the reality is it's kind of like dumping a puzzle box onto a table. The pieces still need to be put together in order for the picture to be complete and accurate. All transfers should be shown as transfers, not separate deposits and withdrawals.

Once you can see the assets sitting in the Celsius Exchange wallet, you can determine the cost basis by simulating a sale. **Create a TEMPORARY transaction showing a withdrawal of the full amount for each crypto lost, zeroing out the account.** On each of those transactions, you'll be able to see the cost basis attached. These numbers will be vital to the calculation below.

# Understanding Your Claim Value

Your claim value is based on (1) the crypto assets lost (type and amount), (2) [the values of the tokens at 8:10 PM ET on 7/13/2022](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb57fb5d4-f4c7-46d8-9688-78bc72331341_764x2048.jpeg) per the bankruptcy document, and (3) whether or not you opted **out** of the class action settlement.

Take all your lost tokens and multiply the amount by the values in the above screenshot. This is your initial claim value. Unless you specifically opted **out** of the class action settlement, your claim will automatically receive a 5% mark up. So if you did not opt out of the class action settlement, multiply your initial claim by 1.05. This is your final claim amount that your distributions will be based off of.

# Distribution Payout Structure

Now that you know your claim value, we can begin to understand the distributions received. Celsius hopes to distribute 79.2% of each person's claim amount, leaving 20.8% of your claim likely unrecoverable. The breakout of how these distributions will be split is below.

* \~28.95% - to be paid out in BTC (some will receive slightly less/more BTC than ETH)
* \~28.95% - to be paid out in ETH (some will receive slightly less/more ETH than BTC)
* 14.9% - to be paid out in Ionic Stock
* 6.4% - to be paid out in an unknown disbursement (from sale of illiquid assets)
* 20.8% - likely unrecoverable

The BTC, ETH, and Stock distributions are to occur in 2024, with the ""effective date"" set as 1/16/2024. This date is the date used in determining the fair value of the distributed assets. **The following values must be used in the calculation for the received BTC, ETH, and stock.**

* BTC = $42,973/BTC
* ETH = $2,577/ETH
* Stock = $20/unit

The remaining 6.4% distribution date is unknown. It could be in 2025, or it could be in a decade. The additional 20.8% that is likely unrecoverable won't be factually established as unrecoverable until the court proceedings are finalized, which again could take a decade.

# Understanding Your Maximum Loss

Before we get into the actual calculation, it's important to nail down the concept of your maximum loss. This is high level and just to set the fundamentals before getting into the details. Taking a step back, **your maximum loss is equal to the cost basis of assets lost.** Period. Your max loss will never be more than your cost basis (**the fair value of assets lost does not influence your maximum loss**).

**Your maximum loss is not the same as your claimable loss**. The maximum loss is just a starting point. The fair value of any assets subsequently received in a distribution will decrease this loss. In other words, if no distributions were made, the loss you can claim is equal to your maximum loss aka the cost basis of the assets lost. The formula is simple. **Maximum Loss - Fair Value of Distributions = Claimable Loss.**

Let's use an example.

Example: Cost basis of assets lost (maximum loss) = $500. In total, you receive distributions totaling $200 in fair value at the time. The loss you can claim is... $500 - $200 = $300 claimable loss. This concept should hopefully be fairly straight forward.

What if the fair value of what I received is **more** than the cost basis of assets lost? In a scenario like this, you actually have a **gain** on the distribution.

Let's look at another example:

Example: Cost basis of assets lost (maximum loss) = $100. In total, you receive distributions totaling $200 in fair value at the time. Using the same formula... $100 - $200 = -$100 aka **a $100 GAIN**.

In the above scenario, since you received assets worth more than the cost basis of the assets lost, you actually are in a gain position. This is common for those who bought crypto early on and simply held for a long time. **It's important to note, the amount of crypto lost vs received is irrelevant, it is solely based on the dollar value of cost basis vs dollar value of distribution.**

# Understanding Taxable Event Timing

Now that we have the fundamentals down for your maximum loss vs your claimable loss (or gain), we need to dive deeper into the timing of when these losses/gains need to be recognized.

**Simply put, a taxable event only occurs when a distribution is made (or its determined no more distributions will be made)**. Therefor, the gains/losses will be recognized when (1) the 2024 distributions were made, (2) the 6.4% distribution from the sale of illiquid assets is made at some time in the future, and (3) when the court proceedings finalize and it is factually established the 20.8% remaining amount will not be recovered.

# Understanding Forced Liquidation

When Celsius went bankrupt, all assets on the platform were frozen. No withdrawals or trades could be made. For ease of understanding, you can imagine these assets simply sat locked up in a wallet doing nothing at all. In order to fund the distributions of BTC, ETH, and stock (and any future distributions), these assets will be sold. This is known as a ""forced liquidation"". However, for tax purposes, until that point they simply sit untouched. This is why the taxable event does not occur until the distribution is made as the forced liquidation does not occur until that point.

# Understanding Non Like-Kind Distributions

While many people lost BTC and/or ETH on Celsius, there are some who held neither on the platform. Since they did not hold BTC or ETH, receiving the BTC and ETH (and stock) would be considered a non like-kind distribution and result in a forced liquidation (taxable event). In these scenarios, the calculation is quite a bit easier than the scenarios where a user held BTC and/or ETH.

Before we get into the nuances of distributions of like-kind assets, let's do a high level break down of how to calculate the loss/gain realized when a user did not hold either BTC or ETH.

Using the percentages from the ""Distribution Payout Structure"", allocate your total cost basis of lost assets to each. For example, 28.95% of your total cost basis should be allocated to BTC, 28.95% of your total cost basis should be allocated to ETH, 14.9% of your total cost basis should be allocated to Stock, 6.4% of your total cost basis should be allocated (reserved) for the future distributions from the sale of illiquid assets, and 20.8% of your total cost basis should be allocated (reserved) for the likely unrecoverable amount (yes, this means that amount won't be able to be recognized as a loss until the court proceedings complete, which could be years).

Now that you have allocated your total cost basis of lost assets to each of the distribution categories, you can begin to calculate the loss/gain recognized for the 2024 distributions by using the formula mentioned in the ""Understanding Your Maximum Loss"" section.

Let's look at an example.

Assume the only asset you lost was 1,000 USDC on Celsius with a cost basis of $1,000. Your claim value is $1,050 (5% markup for not opting out of the class action settlement). Of that cost basis, $289.5 is allocated to BTC distribution, $289.5 is allocated to ETH distribution, $149.5 is allocated to Stock distribution, $64 is reserved for future distribution from sale of illiquid assets, and $208 is reserved for the amount that is likely unrecoverable (and can only be claimed once proceedings finalize). In 2024, you receive $303.98 worth of BTC (28.95% x $1,050), $303.98 worth of ETH (28.95% x $1,050), and $160 worth of Stock (14.9% x $1,050, rounded to nearest share). In this scenario, you actually have a **gain**. Below is the calculation.

* BTC Distribution: $303.98 FMV - $289.5 cost basis = $14.48 capital gain in 2024
* ETH Distribution: $303.98 FMV - $289.5 cost basis = $14.48 capital gain in 2024
* Stock Distribution: $160 FMV - $149.5 cost basis = $10.5 capital gain in 2024

To summarize, the loss/gain calculated for each distribution is equal to the fair market value of the assets received (using the effective date price) minus the cost basis allocated to that distribution.

# Understanding Like-Kind Distributions

As mentioned above, most people held either BTC or ETH on Celsius at the time of bankruptcy in addition to other assets. Given the fact that part of the distribution was made ""in-kind"", a forced liquidation does not actually occur. In other words, if you had BTC and/or ETH stuck on Celsius, and since part of the distribution is being paid in BTC and ETH, the amount returned can be viewed as simply a transfer off of Celsius with no forced liquidation (and thus no taxable event). **With that said, this is where the calculation can get quite complex.**

There are a few things to consider here.

* How much BTC was stuck on Celsius? How much BTC was received in the distribution?
   * If you received **more** BTC than what was lost, the full amount of BTC lost is considered a transfer and the excess amount will require a forced liquidation calculation.
   * If you received **less** BTC than what was lost, only the amount returned is considered a transfer and the remaining BTC lost on the platform will be used in forced liquidation calculations for other assets.
* How much ETH was stuck on Celsius? How much ETH was received in the distribution?
   * If you received **more** ETH than what was lost, the full amount of ETH lost is considered a transfer and the excess amount will require a forced liquidation calculation.
   * If you received **less** ETH than what was lost, only the amount returned is considered a transfer and the remaining ETH lost on the platform will be used in forced liquidation calculations for other assets.
* When receiving **less** BTC and/or ETH than what was lost, you'll have some flexibility in deciding which tax lots to assign to the returned BTC/ETH and which tax lots should be left for forced liquidation. For example, say you lost 3 ETH with cost basis of $1k, $2k, and $3k accordingly. Only 1 ETH was ""returned"" to you and the others will be used for forced liquidation. For the ETH returned to you, you need to chose which cost basis of either $1k, $2k, or $3k should be assigned to the returned ETH and the remaining to be used for forced liquidations.

For simplicity sake, the BTC/ETH received will fall into one of two buckets, ""Returned"" or ""New"". These names will be important to continue following along.

1. **""Returned""** BTC/ETH refers to BTC/ETH that was previously held on the platform but has now been returned. The **maximum** amount of ""Returned"" BTC/ETH is the full amount that was lost on the platform, however the ""returned"" amount **can be less** than the amount lost on the platform in scenarios where you receive less BTC/ETH than what you had lost.
2. **""New""** BTC/ETH refers to BTC/ETH received in distribution that is **in excess of the amount lost**. So if you didn't hold any BTC or ETH, then the amount you receive is 100% ""New"".

# Calculating Loss/Gain On Distributions

If you've made it this far, then you're almost there. However, this is the most complicated step but hopefully with a few examples you'll be able to follow along.

In order to calculate your loss/gain on the distributions, I've created the step-by-step process below.

1. **Identify ""Returned"" BTC and ETH vs ""New"" BTC and ETH**
   * Again, at the maximum the ""Returned"" BTC/ETH will be equal to what was lost. Anything received in the distribution in excess of what you lost will be ""New"".
2. **For ""Returned"" BTC/ETH, Identify Cost Basis Returned**
   * If you receive **100%** of the BTC and/or ETH that you initially lost, then allocate 100% of the cost basis of the BTC/ETH to the returned amount. It's as if that crypto just sat idle for 2 years, keeping the same cost basis.
   * If you receive **less than 100%** of the BTC and/or ETH that you initially lost, then you will need to determine the cost basis for the returned amount (it can't just be 100% of what was lost and it also can't just be a percentage of what you received vs what was lost). Refer to the example in the ""Understanding Like-Kind Distributions"" section. If you want to use the cost basis in line with your cost basis accounting method, the easiest way to do this would be to simulate a sale in Koinly of the amount returned to and assign the cost basis from that to the amount ""Returned"".
3. **Identify Remaining Cost Basis to be Allocated**
   * After identifying the cost basis associated to the ""returned"" BTC and ETH, we need to calculate the remaining cost basis to be allocated. Use this formula: Total Cost basis of all assets lost - cost basis of ""returned"" assets = remaining cost basis to allocate.
4. **Determine Starting Percentages for Allocation for Remaining Categories**
   * There are 5 categories. The ""New"" amounts require a simple calculation to determine starting percentages, whereas the remaining catagories don't require a calculation. The 5 categories are as follows....
      * BTC ""New"" Starting Percentage = (""New"" amount received / Total amount received) x 28.95%
      * ETH ""New"" Starting Percentage = (""New"" amount received / Total amount received) x 28.95%
      * Stock Starting Percentage = 14.9%
      * Illiquid Asset Recovery Starting Percentage = 6.4%
      * Likely Unrecoverable Starting Percentage = 20.8%
   * To solidify some knowledge here, going back to the ""Understanding Non Like-Kind Distributions"" section, if you **did not lose any BTC or ETH** on Celsius, then the received amounts for each would both be 100% ""New"" and thus result in the starting percentage for allocation would be the full 28.95%.
5. **Calculate the Final Percentages for Cost Basis Allocation**
   * Sum together all of the ""starting percentages"" calculated above. **Hint, unless you didn't lose any BTC/ETH on Celsius, then these** ***won't*** **sum to 100%.**
   * Now calculate the final percentage of each of the 5 categories by taking each category's starting percentage and dividing by the sum of all the categories. The formula is as follows... Category Final Percentage = Category Starting Percentage / Sum of All Category Starting Percentages.
   * The remaining percentages are now the final percentages to be used in allocating the remaining cost basis
6. **Allocate Remaining Cost Basis**
   * Using the ""final percentages"" calculated in step 5 (which should now all sum to 100%), allocate the remaining cost basis calculated in step 3.
   * If done correctly, the ""returned"" BTC and ETH will have the cost basis of the initial amounts lost on the platform as determined in Step 2, and the remaining cost basis will be allocated across the other 5 categories as determined by as determined in Steps 3 - 5. All the cost basis has now been assigned which will be used in determining any loss or gain to be realized on the distributions.
7. **Calculate Loss/Gain on Distribution**
   * For the ""Returned"" BTC and ETH, there is no taxable event and thus no loss or gain recognized at that time. As expressed previously, the ""returned"" amounts just keep the cost basis as if they just sat idle for 2 years and will only have a gain or loss once sold.
   * For the ""New"" BTC/ETH and Stock received in 2024, calculate the fair value using the prices on the effective date discussed in the ""Distribution Payout Structure"" section above. Take the amount of crypto and stock received and multiply it by those amounts to determine total proceeds.
   * Take the total proceeds of the ""New"" BTC, ETH, and Stock received and subtract out the cost basis allocated to each as determined in Step 6. If the proceeds (FMV) of what was received is **more** than the cost basis allocated, then you actually have a capital **gain** on that distribution. If you the proceeds (FMV) of what was received is **less** than the cost basis allocated, then you have a capital **loss** on the distribution.
8. **Cost Basis Reserved for Future Distributions**
   * There are two categories that had cost basis assigned to them but do not have an impact in the 2024 tax year, (1) Distributions from sale of illiquid assets (6.4%) and (2) Likely unrecoverable amount (20.8%).
      * Sale of illiquid assets: Any distributions received from the sale of illiquid assets will use the cost basis allocated to that category to determine loss/gain realized at that time.
      * Likely unrecoverable: Once court proceedings are finalized and it's determined no more distributions will be made, the cost basis allocated to this category can be claimed as a loss in full. However, if any additional distributions are made, this loss will be reduced by the FMV of additional distributions received.

Using these steps, you will be able to effectively allocate the cost basis of assets lost on Celsius to the 7 different categories (BTC ""Returned"", BTC ""New"", ETH ""Returned"", ETH ""New"", Stock, Sale of Illiquid Assets, Likely Unrecoverable) and calculate your realized gain or loss in 2024 and future years using the fair value of the distributions received.

A few examples might help.

# Example #1 - Received Less BTC and Less ETH Than Initially Lost

Scenario: You lost 1 BTC, 10 ETH, and 50,000 USDC with cost basis of $10,000, $5,000, and $50,000 respectively ($65,000 total). Your total claim is $84,800.85 calculated using the petition prices linked in the ""Understanding Your Claim Value"" section with the 5% markup added. You receive 0.571285 BTC, 9.526521 ETH, and 632 shares of Ionic stock in 2024.

Follow the steps.

**Step 1) Identify ""Returned"" BTC and ETH vs ""New"" BTC and ETH**

Returned BTC = 0.571285, New BTC = 0, Returned ETH = 9.526521, New ETH = 0.

**Step 2) For ""Returned"" BTC/ETH, Identify Cost Basis Returned**

After manually looking at your tax lots of the crypto lost on Celsius, you determined the returned BTC has a cost basis of $7,000 and the returned ETH has a cost basis of $4,500.

**Step 3) Identify Remaining Cost Basis to be Allocated**

$65,000 total cost basis - $7,000 - $4,500 = $53,500 remaining

**Step 4) Determine Starting Percentages for Allocation for Remaining Categories**

* BTC ""New"" = (0/0.571285) x 28.95% = 0%
* ETH ""New"" = (0/9.526521) x 28.95% = 0%
* Stock = 14.9%
* Illiquid Asset Recovery = 6.4%
* Likely Unrecoverable = 20.8%

**Step 5) Calculate the Final Percentages for Cost Basis Allocation**

1. 0% + 0% + 14.9% + 6.4% + 20.8% = 42.1%
2. Calculate final percentages based on proportion
   1. BTC ""New"" = 0% / 42.1%  = 0%
   2. ETH ""New"" = 0% / 42.1%  = 0%
   3. Stock = 14.9% / 42.1%  = 35.4%
   4. Illiquid Asset Recovery = 6.4% / 42.1%  = 15.2%
   5. Likely Unrecoverable = 20.8% / 42.1%  = 49.4%

**Step 6) Allocate Remaining Cost Basis**

Cost basis for BTC and ETH ""Returned is as follows:

1. BTC ""Returned"" = $7,000
2. ETH ""Returned"" = $4,500

Cost basis allocation for remaining categories is as follows

1. BTC ""New"" = 0% x $53,500 = $0
2. ETH ""New"" = 0% x $53,500 = $0
3. Stock = 35.4% x $53,500 = $18,935
4. Illiquid Asset Recovery = 15.2% x $53,500 = $8,132
5. Likely Unrecoverable = 49.4% x $53,500 = $26,429

**Step 7) Calculate Loss/Gain on Distribution**

1. BTC ""Returned"" (0.571285) = No taxable event, crypto retains cost basis
2. BTC ""New"" (0) = No new BTC, no cost basis allocated
3. ETH ""Returned"" (9.526521) = No taxable event, crypto retains cost basis
4. ETH ""New"" (0) = No new BTC, no cost basis allocated
5. Stock (632) = FMV of $12,640 - $18,935 cost basis = $6,295 Capital Loss in 2024

**Step 8) Cost Basis Reserved for Future Distributions**

1. Illiquid Asset Recovery = Cost basis of $8,132 reserved to offset distributions received
2. Likely Unrecoverable = Cost basis of $26,429 to be claimed as loss once court proceedings finalize

# Example #2 - Received More BTC and More ETH Than Initially Lost

Scenario: You lost 0.25 BTC, 2.5 ETH, and 50,000 USDC with cost basis of $2,500, $1,250, and $50,000 respectively ($53,750 total). Your total claim is $60,575.21 calculated using the petition prices linked in the ""Understanding Your Claim Value"" section with the 5% markup added. You receive 0.408082 BTC, 6.805015 ETH, and 451 shares of Ionic stock in 2024.

Follow the steps.

**Step 1) Identify ""Returned"" BTC and ETH vs ""New"" BTC and ETH**

Returned BTC = 0.25, New BTC = 0.158082, Returned ETH = 2.5, New ETH = 4.305015.

**Step 2) For ""Returned"" BTC/ETH, Identify Cost Basis Returned**

Since 100% of both the BTC and ETH were returned, the full cost basis of each is assumed for the ""Returned"" amounts. The ""Returned"" BTC keeps the $2,500 cost basis and the ""Returned"" ETH keeps the $1,250 cost basis.

**Step 3) Identify Remaining Cost Basis to be Allocated**

$53,750 total cost basis - $2,500 - $1,250 = $50,000 remaining

**Step 4) Determine Starting Percentages for Allocation for Remaining Categories**

* BTC ""New"" = (0.158082/0.408082) x 28.95% = 11.2%
* ETH ""New"" = (4.305015/6.805015) x 28.95% = 18.3%
* Stock = 14.9%
* Illiquid Asset Recovery = 6.4%
* Likely Unrecoverable = 20.8%

**Step 5) Calculate the Final Percentages for Cost Basis Allocation**

1. 11.2% + 18.3% + 14.9% + 6.4% + 20.8% = 71.6%
2. Calculate final percentages based on proportion
   1. BTC ""New"" = 11.2% / 71.6%  = 15.64%
   2. ETH ""New"" = 18.3% / 71.6%  = 25.56%
   3. Stock = 14.9% / 71.6%  = 20.81%
   4. Illiquid Asset Recovery = 6.4% / 71.6%  = 8.94%
   5. Likely Unrecoverable = 20.8% / 71.6%  = 29.05%

**Step 6) Allocate Remaining Cost Basis**

Cost basis for BTC and ETH ""Returned is as follows:

1. BTC ""Returned"" = $2,500
2. ETH ""Returned"" = $1,250

Cost basis allocation for remaining categories is as follows

1. BTC ""New"" = 15.64% x $50,000 = $7,820
2. ETH ""New"" = 25.56% x $50,000 = $12,780
3. Stock = 20.81% x $50,000 = $10,405
4. Illiquid Asset Recovery = 8.94% x $50,000 = $4,470
5. Likely Unrecoverable = 29.05% x $50,000 = $14,525

**Step 7) Calculate Loss/Gain on Distribution**

*Reminder, the FMV is determined using the effective date prices on 1/16/2024 as shown in ""Distribution Payout Structure"" section above.*

1. BTC ""Returned"" (0.25) = No taxable event, crypto retains cost basis
2. BTC ""New"" (0.158082) = FMV of $6,793 - $7,820 cost basis = $1,027 Capital Loss in 2024
3. ETH ""Returned"" (2.5) = No taxable event, crypto retains cost basis
4. ETH ""New"" (4.305015) = FMV of $11,094 - $12,780 cost basis = $1,686 Capital Loss in 2024
5. Stock (451) = FMV of $9,020 - $10,405 cost basis = $1,385 Capital Loss in 2024

**Step 8) Cost Basis Reserved for Future Distributions**

1. Illiquid Asset Recovery = Cost basis of $4,470 reserved to offset distributions received
2. Likely Unrecoverable = Cost basis of $14,525 to be claimed as loss once court proceedings finalize

# Comments on Examples

In total, there are 16 different types of scenarios. While the two examples above show the calculation for receiving both more BTC and ETH and less BTC and ETH for low cost basis scenarios, you can of course have a mismatched scenario where you receive more BTC and less ETH or vice versa. However, if you just follow the instructions the calculation should stand up against any of the 16 possible scenarios outlined below.

# Closing Remarks

All in all, the Celsius calculation is far from simple. With so many moving parts, it feels like playing multi-dimensional chess. Each solution I came across online often worked well with 1 of the 16 scenarios. However, after trying to apply it to the rest it would fall apart at some point. The solution I have provided and outlined above is universal and can be used for any and all of the possible scenarios. It is comprehensive and granular to the point someone can perform the calc for themselves on their own. Unlike others, I don't want to gate-keep this calculation from the hundreds of thousands of people impacted by the bankruptcy.

I'm working on a hybrid DApp that tracks steps and runs fitness tournaments, with rewards for the top performers. Here's a quick breakdown of the project:

# Why Blockchain?

For tournaments, I needed a **trustless system** where user steps are transparent and verifiable. So, I used blockchain to store the steps data, making it tamper-proof and easily auditable by anyone.

# Tech Stack:

* **Blockchain:** Solidity, Ether.js, Hardhat
* **Testing:** Chai, Mocha
* **Backend:** ExpressJS, NodeJS, MongoDB
* **Client:** Unity (C#)

# How It Works:

* The **client-side** is built in **Unity**, but since there's limited blockchain support in Unity, I'm using **REST APIs** to connect to a traditional backend.
* Most smart contract interactions (like registering steps) happen on the backend, and Unity communicates with it via APIs.

Still in development, but I’m really excited about how it’s shaping up! Let me know if you have any thoughts or feedback! positive

**(1) ETH's road to Internet Money**

There is no question that ETH needs to stay decentralized and censorship-resistant as Vitalik argued on the road to Internet Money. But is this enough? Guys from Defi camp like Uniswap, Frax, Lido have argued that Defi is critical part of that road. I would argue ETH needs to stay relevant as the central of Crypto chain activities, be it Defi or NFT or anything new. Otherwise early adopters will jump to other ecosystems and wide adoption will go straight into that ecosystem when the time comes. If a system is not used or not as performant or convenient to use, why would anyone trust it as internet money?

**(2) ETH's road to Value Store**

Still, there is no question that Ethereum chain has to stay decentralized and censorship-resistant for value storage. But ETH coin is inseparable from Ethereum chain, then if ETH is losing its user case as argued in (1), why could anyone use it as value store? Value store is still a store of things of value, and people needs to have incentives to hold ETH. And more, it cannot be use cases that does not accrete value to ETH, as what $ATOM failed at with its best giving-out-for-free Cosmos SDK. That people started to use Bitcoin as value store was because Bitcoin had a unique user case - the first chain that is decentralized and censorship-resistant and can handle payment. ETH came second, then decentralized and censorship-resistant alone would not be enough, and use cases & value accretion will have to be there to drive ETH adoption.

So even if ETH goal is value store, it still needs to become Internet Money first. Like US Dollar is international money as today, but foreign countries holding it as value store is not because it is value store, it's because they need to use USD for payment. Foreign countries mostly held GBP 100 years ago.",positive,0.8848616,2

357,2024-09-08,"Practical use cases for ETH that you are using right now?Aside from theoretical or future use cases of Ethereum, what are some day-to-day use cases you are actually using Etheruem for right now? And what traditional system does it improve upon and replace? Everyone talks about smart contracts or decentralized global computing power, but I don’t see people using Ethereum in their every day lives aside from buying/selling/HODLing/staking. I’m not looking for a one-off instance where you used Etheruem in some edge case, but rather a way that you use Ethereum every day that adds value to your life and improves upon a traditional method of accomplishing the same task. 

When researching online, I’ll see examples like betting: You can bet on if it will rain or not tomorrow. Traditionally you would need to trust the loser to pay the winner or if it's a third party to not run away with it. We can avoid this by writing code and by both depositing 100$ for example. When the code sees that yes in fact it did rain, it will automatically transfer the 200$ to the winner. But let’s be real, nobody is actually doing this lol. Plus, you’d have to trust whatever 3rd party module is verifying if it actually rained, and there might be disagreements depending on the module used. Meaning, there will still be elements of the protocol to contest. And humans or other 3rd parties will need to intermediate anyways, eliminating the whole idea of a smart contract. It doesn’t seem realistic. 

Other people say ETH is a global computer, and you can rent computation processing power. But once again, what average joe is actually doing this? I could see maybe some mathematician PhD guy needing to calculate the next prime number. But the average person never needs that much computer power to begin with. 

So I’m back to this, what are you using Ethereum for right now in your daily life? What traditional model did it replace for you? How has it improved your life?

Are there any good learning materials to the basic stuff to know?



Some of my initial questions are stuff like:



I hear L2 is ideal for lower fees, should I be converting my ETH directly to rETH, or first converting the ETH to L2, then to rETH? Can L2 ETH always be converted back to L1?



If I happen to have L2 ETH and I accidentally send it to an exchange's L1 address, am I loosing coins, or are there checks and balances in place to prevent mistakes like that from happening?



Or If I'm swapping ETH to another coin like BTC, does it have to be on the main net?



Is there a smart way to test out and learn how this all works hands on? Like should I test with small amounts of tokens, or use Testnet?

405,2024-08-27,"Digital Asset Staking: What is it and how it works, simply. **Background:** Blockchain networks rely on a spread-out system of computers running constantly and are approving new transactions before adding it to the irreversible blockchain. There are two main types of blockchains: Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS).

Why would someone want to do this and do it by the rules? Miners are incentivized through rewards and bear risks when mining. If they act honestly, efficiently, and correctly, they receive Bitcoin as a reward. If they don’t, they lose money due to electricity costs and the initial capital investment required to set up their equipment.

**Proof of Work (PoW):** This is used by Bitcoin. People use computers to solve complex puzzles. When done honestly and correctly, they are rewarded with Bitcoin.

**Proof of Stake (PoS):** This is used by Ethereum. People (validators) stake their Ethereum and are rewarded with additional Ethereum in the future for validating transactions.

Both blockchains rely on a **consensus mechanism**—a method that allows a bunch of random people and computers to reach overall agreement on various matters. This process helps ensure trust, security, and consensus across the blockchain.

**Proof of Work Overview:** Bitcoin uses Proof of Work (PoW), where miners (people running computers constantly) use electricity and capital to verify and add new blocks of transactions to the blockchain. If they perform this task honestly and correctly, they are rewarded with Bitcoin, though the reward amount decreases every four years (a process known as halving). The downside of PoW is that it uses a lot of money and electricity to keep running. *This high resource consumption is one reason why Ethereum transitioned to Proof of Stake (PoS) for its digital assets.*

**Proof of Stake Overview**: Because Proof of Work (PoW) was considered too costly by many in the space, the concept of Proof of Stake (PoS) was developed. Ethereum now uses this method. In PoS, people stake their Ethereum to earn rewards over time. PoS is much more energy-efficient than PoW. Instead of buying and setting up multiple computers to mine Bitcoin, you only need a wallet and an account on a centralized exchange like Coinbase or Gemini (though using these platforms typically involves transferring ownership and paying fees). This approach makes staking more accessible to everyday people, whereas Bitcoin mining has evolved into a large-scale industry, pushing out hobbyist miners. As more people participate in staking, the network’s security increases. 

**Terms to know**

**Staking Lock-Up Periods**: This refers to the length of time your Ethereum will be locked in a custody account, during which you won’t be able to sell or transfer it.

**Staking Minimums:** Running your own Ethereum staking node (without using a service like Coinbase or Gemini) is more complex and requires a minimum of 32 Ethereum to start staking. If you use a centralized exchange (CEX) like Coinbase or Gemini, you can stake any amount since funds are pooled together to meet the 32 Ethereum requirement.

**Staking Withdraw Time:** This is the time it takes to un-stake your ETH. The minimum withdrawal period is 28 hours, but it can vary depending on the staking provider you use",positive,0.90380305,2

How can I find out how many coins different wallets hold? For example, with USDT, I can see that Binance holds the most coins. However, when I check other tokens, the ""Holders"" button doesn't appear. It would be very useful to see this information to check if, for example, the developers hold most of the coins, and so on.

Thank You

I currently hold ( Amount) in ETH with an average cost of $2340. I've run into some financial issues (layoff/exhausted unemployment) and am hoping to liquidate some of my holdings to sustain myself and my family.

My question is, if I hypothetically sold $1000 profit per withdrawal and left my principal deposit dollar amount untouched, is this a smart tactic for DCA'ing out? Also, will withdrawing $1000 per transaction increase my future cost average as well? Will this reduce my profit margins in the future as my quantity of ETH ownership decreases?

I realize the quantity of ETH that I own will get smaller but as long as the market value continues to increase, I should hypothetically be able to keep DCA'ing out profit, if needed?

At the end of the day, i'm a firm believer in ETH and am extremely bullish. My goal is to maintain my principal deposit amount but only pull profits.
Please let me know if i'm headed in the wrong direction here or may be looking at this process the wrong way.

432,2024-08-19,"Help Needed: Ethereum HSM Integration Resulting in ""Invalid Sender"" Error**TL;DR:** Integrating HSM to sign Ethereum transactions but getting ""Invalid Sender"" errors despite correct address recovery and signature application. Need help troubleshooting the issue.  
I am trying to implement wallet generation and signing using an HSM.  I'm currently developing against SoftHSM2, with C#.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I'm running into troubles with ""Invalid Sender""

Hey Ethereum Devs,

I'm currently working on integrating a Hardware Security Module (HSM) to sign Ethereum transactions, and I've run into a persistent ""Invalid Sender"" error that I can't seem to resolve. I’m hoping the community might have some insights or suggestions.

# Background:

I'm using an HSM to securely generate and store Ethereum keys, and then to sign transactions. The process involves retrieving the public and private keys from the HSM, creating a transaction, signing it, and then sending it to the Ethereum network.

Here’s a summary of the workflow:

1. **Retrieve Public Key Info:** I retrieve the public key and its associated label from the HSM based on the Ethereum address.
2. **Generate Transaction Hash:** I use the `Sha3Keccack` hash function to create a message hash from the public key.
3. **Initial Signature:** I generate an initial signature with the retrieved private key using the message hash.
4. **Create Transaction:** I build a `LegacyTransaction` object with the transaction parameters like nonce, gas price, gas limit, etc.
5. **Recompute Transaction Hash:** The transaction hash is recomputed, including the Chain ID to ensure EIP-155 compliance.
6. **Final Signature:** I generate the final signature with the recomputed transaction hash.
7. **Adjust V for EIP-155:** The `V` value is adjusted as per EIP-155 (i.e., `V = finalSignature.V + Chain ID * 2 + 35`).
8. **Apply Final Signature:** I set the final signature on the transaction and serialize it.
9. **Send Transaction:** The serialized transaction is sent to the Ethereum network.

# The Problem:

Despite the transaction being created and signed correctly (as far as I can tell), when I submit it, I consistently get an ""Invalid Sender"" error.

# Debugging Data:

Here’s some of the debug output:

* **Public Key Info:** `Address=0xd2de6f19109d613f17496837e03909ad26632081`, `Label=test`
* **Message Hash:** `dd5e1cc957e9cf152b8e6d7ef12160622a31b329cad932d57998e9334ef0495a`
* **Initial Signature:** `R=0EE8B7B9FE8DAC6267ABADAA5F339D234A4B3CB4BAE4FC3BC31B619A8C726946F`, `S=641FEBC235A4EECA13597671AC5B1A32314D4DD07ABD84F074A93AAC674F77C2`, `V=28`
* **Recovered Address v27:** `0x0D9D930AC4Af2EdB21369c0A362F8c813264B85b`
* **Recovered Address v28:** `0xD2DE6F19109D613f17496837e03909aD26632081` (This is the correct one)
* **Transaction Hash:** `2f0028f56b6e1550d7a34e5da3048ef4ecda121004c38135f276ff7293a6e0db`
* **Final Signature:** `R=76AB822FD1B3D61C0C261B5FEEE33014F95EB658B93412FB8E2C8222C79CB91F`, `S=0811F55B97C7D97253CFD39B76B3A244C612BBEBB13BA76BD2160AFE6C6853FF9`, `V=141`

Despite the correct address being recovered with `V=28`, the transaction still results in an ""Invalid Sender"" error when the signed transaction is submitted.

# Code Snippet:

Here’s the critical part of the code where I believe the issue might be:

    csharpCopy codevar vValue = (byte)(finalSignature.V + _chainId * 2 + 35);
    transaction.SetSignature(new Signature
    {
        R = finalSignature.R,
        S = finalSignature.S,
        V = new byte[] { vValue }
    });
    var serializedTx = transaction.GetRLPEncoded().ToHex();

# What I’ve Tried:

* **Checked V Calculation:** Confirmed that the `V` value is calculated as per EIP-155.
* **Address Recovery:** Verified that the correct address is recovered with `V=28`.
* **Serialized Transaction:** Compared the serialized transaction output with a known good transaction; it looks correct.

# Community Help:

I'm stumped at this point. Does anyone have experience with HSMs and Ethereum transactions? Could it be an issue with the way I’m applying the signature or something subtle in the transaction serialization?

Any advice, suggestions, or pointers would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks in advance for your help!

I've made some progress.

The NEthereum has the LegacyTransactionChainId Class, which should be used for EIP-155.

The Dencun upgrade brought us the much-anticipated blobs via EIP-4844, which have improved the Layer 2 users’ experience by making transactions cheaper and more efficient.

 Let’s take a moment to review the progress blobs have made over the past half-year:

* 2.3 million total blobs since the Dencun upgrade 
* 596,000 blocks containing blobs 
* 1.1 million blob transactions 

These numbers only scratch the surface of the significant impact blobs have had on the Ethereum ecosystem, enhancing both efficiency and usability.

The momentum around blobs is growing, with more and more submitters joining in. We now have a robust ecosystem that includes Base, Optimism, Arbitrum, Taiko, Scroll, Blast, Linea, Starknet, Zora, Zircuit, Kroma, and many more.

This growing network of L2s is making Ethereum more efficient, affordable, and driving innovation across all layers and dApps.

EIP-4844 also introduced a smart mechanism that adjusts the blob base fee according to supply and demand. Recently, we’ve seen the reaching the current target - 3 blobs per block. This dynamic fee model is designed to keep blob processing efficient and optimize block space.

 Check out more details here: [dune.com/hildobby/blobs](http://dune.com/hildobby/blobs)

Before EIP-4844, there was a lot of uncertainty around pricing. But now, it’s clear that blobs have surpassed expectations. Comparing the cost of blobs to calldata on Rob's dashboard shows just how much cheaper blobs are.

I'm currently trying to decide which stablecoin to use, but I'm concerned about censorship and the possibility of my funds being frozen. I know that both USDT (Tether) and USDC (USD Coin) have had issues in this regard:

USDT: Tether has been known to freeze addresses when asked to by law enforcement or other authorities. This has happened multiple times in the past, which raises concerns about how safe it is to hold USDT if you're worried about potential censorship.

USDC: USD Coin is designed to be fully compliant with U.S. regulations, which means it also has the ability to freeze funds and block transactions if required by the government. Given that it's backed by regulated financial institutions, it seems more prone to responding to regulatory pressures.

a new address format would take a person's address, a chain ID, and optionally a token contract, and just mash them all together. for example:

vitalik's ETH address

    0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045
    
the chain ID of Arbitrum One

the contract address of the USDC token

what this would do is, when you paste it into your wallet, it will instruct your wallet to only send USDC on Arbitrum One to vitalik. or to send ETH, just don't add a contract address. your wallet would have to separate the pieces and perform a regular transaction using the traditional address format, so the network itself doesn't really need to know that you used a longer address. it's not that much different from how bitcoin mainnet QR codes may add instructions such as a requested amount.",positive,0.8832166,7

459,2024-08-11,"A fully decentralized account recovery system ?I've been looking into account abstraction features and account recovery sounds like something very important to improve the user experience.

But it come with counterpart, most of theses method introduce trust and centralization in the process.

So I tried to imagine a way to recover account in a fully decentralized way.

And I found something, and I would like to share it with the community to know if it could be a good Idea or not and if it's a good one, is it already existing ?

The idea is to create a recovery contract. The contract has the right to assign a sender into authorized signers in the smart account. We can imagine to plug it to the factory or something like that.

The idea is to use 2 parameters, a recovery deposit and a a time lock duration.

To recover an account you have to send the recovery deposit to the recovery contract and wait for the time lock duration.

During timelock, the signers of the smart account can decline the claim and the recovery attempt is cancelled. Then the recovery deposit is sent to the smart account.

If nothing happens after timelock, then the claimer become a smart account signer.

The 2 parameters can be set by the owner based on his risk tolerance and his balance. A 500eth account should have a higher recovery deposit and more timelock to avoid people trying to recover it.

Hypothetically, anyone can try to recover an account but due to the deposit needed, the risk to do it will Discourage people to try it. And in case it happens, it also reward the owner as a sort of ""compensation"".

I also imagined some counter to fraudulent attempt like frontrun, some people can try to listen mempool to find account recovery transactions and frontrun them cause they are sure that theses account are not protected cause owner has lost access to it.

The counter is to make the process in 2 transaction:

1. a proof of intention sent to the recovery contract witch is just a hash of the account to recover and the address of the claimer.

2. The claim. In the claim function the contract will hash the sender and the account address, and if there is a matching hash in the proof of intention list, then transaction is valid.

By this way the claimer can't be frontrunned and will get access to his account before frontrunners. We can also imagine to set a limit of 1 recovery attempt at the same time to avoid people to claim just after to try to stole funds.

What do you think of this system? It could be implemented as optionnal recovery method for people who don't want to trust people to recover their account.",positive,0.8971587,16

While it seems that our beloved chain has linear stake growth, which is partially true (see the upper chart), when we drill down a bit deeper — the reality seems to be different. Thus, to represent this fact two charts — absolute staked ETH and stake delta — are combined.

The chart below, which presents the delta of stake inflows and unstakes, shows the tendency of repetitive staking activation cycles. The biggest spikes of staked Ether are usually around the upgrades, each of which brought some highly anticipated feature: either burn, staking, withdrawals, or Proto-Danksharding (also known as blobs), showcasing strong community confidence and support for new Ethereum.

482,2024-08-04,"""Proof-of-suffrage"" consensus engine with proof-of-unique-human that Johan started inventing in 2015, operationalIt has the most secure random number ""Oracle"" or ""generator"" conceivable, I think. Relies on Poisson distribution and that people vote in a way where they cannot know what they vote on... (vote ""mutates"" after commit phase but prior to reveal phase).

The system in operation can be seen on [https://scan.polytopia.org/transactions](https://scan.polytopia.org/transactions) where `revealHash` is an individual participating in the random number ""oracle"" (defining ""oracle"" as something that submits a random number, and here, billions of people collaborate to submit it... although ""generator"" is another way to view it).

The consensus engine is based on the consensus engine interface in Go-Ethereum, and thus not ideal. Ideally it would use the `generateWork` path that was added in 2022 (see discussion on that [here](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/23256#pullrequestreview-817601139)) and is currently used by proof-of-stake Ethereum. Since my engine uses the ""old"" block production pathway, it has to do some things in a unnatural way. It works, everything is being done, but automated voter rewards (as coinbase payouts) are not possible, and timestamp is managed in a bit overcomplicated way when validators are skipped...

Validator selection in consensus engine is extremely simple. It actually selects a voter, not a validator (and voters are ""atomic"" or ""fungible"" making selecting them as easy as `randomNumber%voters`) and then simply looks up who the voter voted for. So no need to account for ""weight"" of validator or how many votes (analogous to how much ""stake"" they have if in proof-of-stake) so mathematically simpler.

Analogous ""proof-of-suffrage"" engine could be used by any nation-state in the world for their own ""sovereign national blockchain"" and such projects will likely start to appear within next decade.

506,2024-07-30,"Celebrating 9 years of Ethereum progress successToday, we celebrate the revolutionary blockchain platform that has revolutionized decentralized applications (dApps) and finance (DeFi). Let’s take a look at the biggest Ethereum moments so far:

1. In 2017, the Byzantium Fork not only reduced the block reward from 5 ETH to 3 ETH but also introduced new technology that made it easier for other blockchains to build on Ethereum. This was a game-changing moment, fueling Ethereum's vision of a decentralized web.
2. Later in 2017, the NFT game CryptoKitties became a sensation, causing record-high activity on the Ethereum blockchain. This event highlighted the growing interest in NFTs and showcased the need for Ethereum's speed and scalability improvements.
3. Fast forward to 2019: the Istanbul and Constantinople upgrades optimized Ethereum's gas fee structure, leading to more efficient transactions. They also laid the groundwork for the transition to a Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, signaling a future of greater scalability and security.
4. In 2020, Ethereum introduced the Beacon Chain, a PoS blockchain that promised a new era for Ethereum. The Beacon Chain was a crucial step towards ending Ethereum's reliance on PoW mining, setting the stage for the transformative Merge event.
5. 2022 marked a historic moment: The Merge. Ethereum successfully transitioned to a PoS blockchain, slashing its carbon footprint and changing its daily issuance. This was more than just an upgrade - it was a paradigm shift, establishing Ethereum as an eco-friendly blockchain in the eyes of many.  
6. In 2023, the Shanghai upgrade focused on enhancing the network's functionality. The most notable feature enabled users to unlock and withdraw their staked ETH, which addressed a critical aspect of user control and liquidity in the Ethereum ecosystem.  
7. Now in 2024, the anticipated approval of Ethereum ETFs marked a milestone in mainstream financial markets, providing new investment opportunities.

What, in your opinion, has been the biggest Ethereum achievement so far?

Background: Ethereum Spot ETFs are like a share of stock you can buy, where a company takes your money and buys Ethereum and holds it for you. However, you don’t have direct ownership of the Ethereum.

The BTC and ETH ETFs made it easier for people to invest in digital assets, vs buying directly and storing it yourself. Instead of owing Ethereum directly, you buy a product that tracks the price of Ethereum, just like you would a stock.

This is appealing to institutions, which are big investors who usually have large amounts of money. It also makes it easier for these intuitions to invest in digital assets.

In May, the regulator approved stock exchanges’ applications to list the so-called spot ether ETFs in an about-face that surprised the crypto community.

Asset managers including BlackRock and Fidelity Investments applied to launch the funds. They are known as spot ether ETFs because they buy and sell the digital currency itself, in contrast to existing ETFs that rely on ether futures.

The working paper linked at the address below proves this is wrong - it is achievable.**

[https://saito.tech/socially-optimal-transaction-fee-mechanism-design/](https://saito.tech/socially-optimal-transaction-fee-mechanism-design/)

**Sharing here because although the paper is somewhat academic the proof itself is less than 2 pages and should be accessible to anyone with undergraduate economics. It uses the equation for the ""utility possibility frontier"" developed by Paul Samuelson and Leonid Hurwicz in their Nobel-winning work on optimality of public goods provision.**

**There are two reasons this matters for Ethereum. The first is that it shows that unless a fee mechanism is pareto optimal it can never be incentive compatible, as otherwise there will always be a coalition of participants who can improve their utility by adopting the ""byzantine"" strategy of paying a different fee. This is worth noticing because the papers that claim this is an impossible problem to solve are proposing modifications to the fee design that make it impossible to achieve pareto optimality, which means they don't understand the underlying problem. Having more people understand the underlying problem is the best way to provide pushback against bad ideas getting traction.**  
  
**The second reason is that the paper proves there is a very specific technical property that needs to exist for optimality to happen -- block producers must be incentivized to share unconfirmed and fee-bearing transactions with their peers.**

**There is a lot of research being done on improving the ability for nodes to increase their profits from hoarding transactions, such as optimizing MEV. A lot of the time this is being done under the guise of ""funding infrastructure"" but it is harmful for the network.**",positive,0.8641441,33

I'm developing a decentralized fantasy sports betting contest, and I'm looking for input on which blockchain network would be the best fit. A key feature is that we need to use a single network to manage our jackpot and carry-over pool, so cross-chain solutions aren't viable for us right now.

* Fast transaction times
* Scalability to handle a growing user base
* Strong security (for handling user funds)

Layer 2 solutions are made for scalability purposes. By batching and compressing data, they improve the whole Ethereum ecosystem's scalability.

These networks are built by companies (Matter Labs, Offchain Labs, Consensys, OP Labs, etc.) that will eventually and progressively decentralize network operations.

But, as any company needs to make profits, I'm wondering what is their business model to make profits for themselves? 
Validators and Stakers make money for contributing to the network security. But what is the incentives for the company spending millions of $ to build the foundation of these networks?

For the moment, since most of these networks are centralized and operated by the companies' nodes but their part should progressively reduce as they will keep moving into decentralization.

Is their business model focused on next applications they will build on these networks?
Or is it only focused on operating validators?
Or is it just R&D? But I can't imagine investors would bring millions without having an idea of how they will make money out of it.

565,2024-07-16,"Meme Coin Creation: What I LearnedA few months ago, I thought about how meme coins make huge gains, with the creators making the most money. So I decided to launch my own meme coin.

I chose to create it on the Base network because Solana was having issues at the time. I also considered TON, but there's less money there. Base uses EVM, which means the tools would work on Ethereum or other EVM networks too.

First, I wanted to make sure the token would score 100/100 on checkers. This meant creating a contract where the creator has no control after launch, and locking or burning the liquidity pool (LP) to prevent rug pulls.

I learned that a good meme coin needs a website, Twitter, and Telegram, along with the meme itself and lots of images. After launching the pool, you need to pay to add your logo and links on DexTools and DexScreener.

I decided on a stealth launch instead of a presale. It's common to put 100% of the tokens in the pool at creation, or maybe keep up to 7% for yourself.

How does the developer make money if all tokens are in the pool? They buy back some tokens right after creating the pool, when the price is lowest.

I planned to put all tokens and 0.4 ETH in the pool. If I bought tokens worth 0.4 ETH right after launch, I'd get 50% of all tokens. If I wanted 75%, I'd need to buy 1.2 ETH worth.

The total cost for launching a meme coin, including website creation, pool setup, buying back 50% of tokens, and paying for listings, came to about $5,300.

I learned it's better to spread the tokens across many wallets instead of keeping them in one, as large holdings scare potential buyers. Ideally, no wallet should hold more than 2% of all tokens.

To make everything look good on bubble maps (which show connections between token holders), you need to spread ETH across multiple wallets and buy from each one on Uniswap.

[Bubble Map](https://preview.redd.it/mu8w3algywcd1.png?width=642&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4fb87181d7fb6042c2efd0aa6dd1473ff9d318c)

For a long-lasting token, you need to create pumps by buying tokens, then dump to take profits, and simulate activity between pumps. Doing this manually is impossible, so you need a market maker. I couldn't afford to hire one, so I decided to write my own market maker bot. I created a wallet generator and a script for initial buyback.

When I launched, sniper bots bought a bunch of tokens in the first minute. I had to cancel that pool and create a new one. On the second try, only two sniper bots bought small amounts. I ran my script to buy tokens from 100 wallets, then burned the LP and paid for listings.

Users came and bought some tokens in the first half-day, but most sold after that, and the token didn't grow further. I improved my bot to do wash trading and create pumps, but I realized that pumps in older tokens don't get noticed. To grow further, I'd need to figure out how to buy effective advertising, which I don't know how to do yet and can't afford.

Basically, it seems you can't just launch a token and make money without investing in advertising.   
I've paused my meme coin experiment for now. I'd be interested in continuing with a partner who has crypto traffic or experience in advertising meme coins.

I won't share the token, but I'm happy to answer other technical questions in the comments. If you're interested in the market maker script or partnership, message me on Telegram: akamitch

569,2024-07-16,"The State of ZK - Q2 TL;DRHey there! 

What a quarter! Here's a summary of what happened during Q2 in the ZK space (you can read the full report on the link below): 

* ZK Research continued in Q2 with the release of new papers on sum-check protocols, optimizations around small fields and ZK hardware. 

* zkVMs took center stage, with Jolt, SP1, and Risc Zero each releasing updates that pushed the boundaries of verifiable computation.

* This quarter also witnessed the first mainnet launch of a ZK application platform, with Mina’s Berkeley upgrade. Their zkApps environment will make building ZK applications much more accessible to non-ZK-native developers, and we expect other programmable ZK platforms, such as Aleo and Aztec, to launch soon as well. 

* In terms of ZK applications, several new products addressing payments, on-ramps, voting, and ID were announced or released this past quarter.

* On the ZK Supply Chain front, we saw additional teams announce their plans include a prover marketplace in their systems, and a new category of project emerged in this stack — proof verification aggregators.

570,2024-07-15,"UPDATE: Scammed by Uniswap Slippage MEV Bot - Funds Going to Suspicious AddressHi everyone,

A month ago, I fell victim to a scam promoted through a YouTube sponsored video about a Uniswap slippage MEV bot. I lost 2000$ unfortunately, after realizing my funds were irretrievable, I started monitoring the scammer's wallet address: 0x46D4cEe5d1531A8045c3084D18B6b3c2f5429560

All transactions from his wallet eventually ended up at this address: [https://etherscan.io/address/0x077D360f11D220E4d5D831430c81C26c9be7C4A4](https://etherscan.io/address/0x077D360f11D220E4d5D831430c81C26c9be7C4A4)

This address seems extremely busy, with thousands of dollars moving through it every minute. Upon doing some research, I discovered that other people who got scammed also reported that their funds end up at this address.

Like this post which is 3 years old, the victim's funds ended up in the same address: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Metamask/comments/p9z84o/does\_anyone\_have\_an\_example\_of\_what\_a\_law/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Metamask/comments/p9z84o/does_anyone_have_an_example_of_what_a_law/)

There are other posts about people getting scammed and seems like the funds always ends up in this address. Does anyone know if this address belongs to an exchange or have any insight into what's going on here?",positive,0.7757116,2

576,2024-07-12,"How Danksharding (Blobs) will help ZK-Rollups?As far as I have learnt, Optimistic Rollups need to post the entire transaction data as CALLDATA or BLOBs to the mainnet to allow other validators to verify the correctness. ([Refer 1](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/optimistic-rollups/#:~:text=As%20mentioned%2C%20optimistic,of%20state%20transitions))

But this is not the case for ZK-Rollups as posting the entire transaction data in mainnet is optional. ([Refer 2](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/zk-rollups/#:~:text=ZK%2Drollups%20can%20compress%20transaction%20data%20better%20than%20optimistic%20rollups%20since%20they%20don%27t%20have%20to%20post%20all%20the%20data%20required%20to%20validate%20each%20transaction.%20They%20only%20have%20to%20post%20the%20minimal%20data%20required%20to%20rebuild%20the%20latest%20state%20of%20accounts%20and%20balances%20on%20the%20rollup))

1. Then, how BLOBs are gonna help ZK-Rollups? (Both are doing the same thing: Keep the main net light)
2. ZK-Rollups are costly compared to Optimistic Rollups with Blobs. If yes, why can't we research more on ZK-Rollups rather than on BLOBs. (ZK-Rollups have faster transaction finality and easy to verify)
