FRED Raccon best Community Meme ,1,1gtyb6z,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1gtyb6z/fred_raccon_best_community_meme/,5,"  
with a heavy heart Today, I want to share with you a story that's both heartwarming and heart-wrenching, centered around a unique meme coin on the Solana blockchain called **$FRED**  
  
  
Fred was not just any raccoon; he was a beloved resident of a wildlife sanctuary in Pine City, living a life that many of us wish for our wild friends - safe, cared for, and loved. However, life took a harsh turn for Fred and his squirrel friend, P'Nut, when the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) intervened, leading to both animals being taken from their sanctuary. Sadly, Fred was euthanized, leaving behind a legacy and a movement.  


In honor of Fred's memory, **$FRED** was created on the Solana blockchain. This meme coin doesn't just play into the fun, speculative nature of crypto markets; it carries a message. It symbolizes:  
  
\-Animal Welfare: The coin aims to raise awareness and possibly funds for animal rescue and rehabilitation.  
\-Community Support: With every transaction, there's a narrative of standing up for those who can't speak for themselves, it's listed on Bitget with a community Giveaway to win upto free 30$   
  
\-Memorializing Fred: Every time you hold or trade $FRED, you're keeping the spirit of Fred alive, promoting discussion on animal rights, and how we treat our wildlife.  
\-Meme with a Mission:Unlike many meme coins that exist purely for speculation, $FRED has a narrative that resonates, encouraging a community around a cause.  
  
Let‚Äôs come together to remember Fred, support animal sanctuaries, and perhaps find a new way to invest in crypto that feels right. $FRED isn't just another coin; it's a symbol of what community and crypto can achieve when they align for a cause.  
  
Feel free to share your thoughts, experiences If you're in the fred community

**What is $DRF?**

DRIFE is a decentralized ride-hailing platform that utilizes blockchain technology to create a peer-to-peer network for drivers and riders. The platform operates on the DRF token, which serves as the native currency for all transactions on the platform. The primary goal of DRIFE is to revolutionize the traditional ride-hailing industry by creating a more transparent, secure, and cost-effective system that benefits both drivers and riders.

Unlike traditional ride-hailing platforms, DRIFE is a decentralized platform that eliminates intermediaries, giving riders and drivers more control over their interactions. By leveraging blockchain technology, DRIFE creates a trustless and transparent environment that enables direct peer-to-peer interactions between riders and drivers. This direct connection allows for more personalized and customized ride-hailing experiences, where riders can choose drivers based on specific criteria, such as driver rating, car type, and other preferences.

**What solutions $DRF give to the ride-hailing industry?**

The ride-hailing industry is facing a range of issues that are affecting both drivers and passengers. These issues include high commissions, platform-dictated pricing, lack of transparency and freedom, closed governance, and no loyalty.

We can name few more problems in other competitors ‚Äì sky-rocketing commissions, platform-dictated pricings, lack of transparency and freedom, closed governance, no loyalty and more.

How does DRIFE deal with those problems exactly?

* DRIFE offers innovative solutions to some of the key challenges faced by traditional ride-hailing services. Its zero-commission structure, market-dictated pricing, transparency and freedom to choose an open governance model, and incentivized participation make it a unique and sustainable platform that benefits both riders and drivers.
* No commission - One of the key features of DRIFE is its zero-commission structure. Unlike traditional ride-hailing services, DRIFE does not charge drivers any commission fees for using its platform to connect with riders. This leads to better incomes for drivers who can pass on some of these benefits to riders in the form of reduced commuting costs.
* Market-Dictated Pricing - DRIFE's model offers a unique dynamic pricing mechanism that is based on an auction model. This allows market forces to determine the prices for each ride, rather than a fixed pricing system that is imposed by the platform. The middleman's profit is also eliminated, which means that the prices are even lower for riders, while drivers receive higher incomes for their services.
* Transparency & Freedom to Choose - Transparency and freedom of choice are essential features of the DRIFE platform. The platform's decentralized mobility marketplace and flexible peer-to-peer design give riders and drivers greater control over their experience. Riders can select drivers based on various criteria, such as rating, fare price, pickup time, or specific needs, like child seats or disability access.
* Open Governance - DRIFE's open governance model is a unique approach that aims to create a self-sustaining ecosystem where every stakeholder plays an important role in its growth and maintenance. This is achieved through a franchise model that allows entities such as riders, drivers, fleet owners, and local transportation and logistics companies to govern themselves in a fair and efficient way.
* Incentivized Participation - DRIFE's rewards program is a key aspect of incentivizing participation from both drivers and riders on the platform. By offering rewards for active engagement, DRIFE encourages users to complete rides, provide feedback, and participate in the platform's governance process. These rewards can come in the form of DRF tokens or other perks, which can be used to redeem discounts, free rides, or other benefits

**Do $SRF have a working referral system?**

The Drife team have organized and explained in depth their loyalty and referral system. You can check it out in their whitepaper following this link:

[https://drife.gitbook.io/white-paper/tokenomics](https://drife.gitbook.io/white-paper/tokenomics)

**What is the future development plan of $DRF?**

Integration with other modes of transportation - DRIFE plans to integrate with other modes of transportation, such as public transit, to provide riders with a seamless and convenient end-to-end transportation experience.

* International expansion - DRIFE aims to expand its services to other countries, providing riders and drivers around the world with access to its platform.
* Continued technological Advancements - DRIFE will continue to develop and implement new technologies, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, to improve the ride-hailing experience for its users.
* DRIFE is exploring a new infrastructure layer designed exclusively for mobility, utilizing mobility primitives as a crucial part of the blockchain. This unique approach has the potential to foster innovation in the industry by enabling the community to build mobility-specific use cases.

QANPlatform set for takeoff,5,1gsm5cf,altcoin,https://medium.com/qanplatform/qanplatform-joins-linux-foundation-and-its-post-quantum-cryptography-alliance-577875b69196,22,"I only share here when the chart is down. 

https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/qanplatform

Why down? Mostly looks like holders want to see more testnet progress and updates.  Team has said they have plans to complete this year one way or another.   And it seems with all the partner work, they may very well have some pressure there to get it done. 

We do know they have had a functioning privatenet for sometime and a decision was made to move to proof of stake to allow a faster timeline.  

They had initially pursued a consensus called proof of randomness which would solve some of the risks of PoS.  They may revisit it.

But for now,  their multilanguage public/ private chain, with ethereum compatibility,  and post quantum ready using xlink cross signing is more than enough to tap into a huge market. 

They have removed all the barriers business face when wanting to leverage blockchain solutions. 

So, here they are near the finish line,  but investor fomo is chasing the recent market.  I suspect many will come back with the same fomo the moment QANX starts to move. 

And if you look at the things they are doing such as the linux pqca and cointelegraph accelerator,  along with building sdks for each language where docs start up to date using AI, it becomes clear they are preparing well beyond mainnet.

Let's build a meme together. Will this work?,6,1gs82v6,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1gs82v6/lets_build_a_meme_together_will_this_work/,22,"After all my losses and failed attempts in crypto, I thought about creating a memecoin as a form of representation. At first, I wanted to call it ""Losers,"" but eventually, I changed the name to ""WorldofLosers."" My plan was to create an OpenbookMarketID, set up a liquidity pool, and somehow get it out to the community.

I always feel optimistic before starting something new, but I also get anxious. While setting up the OpenbookMarketID, I made a costly mistake and ended up losing 3 [SOL ](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/solana/)(around $600). That loss hit me hard, and I‚Äôm still working on forgiving myself for it. Ironically, it felt like the name of the coin reflected what had happened.

Later, I discovered pump fun, which made it possible to actually create my memecoin, WorldofLosers ($WOLOSR). Even though I was able to launch it, I still need support from the community to get people trading it. I‚Äôve read that you need about 40 SOL to create enough trade volume and complete the bonding curve, but I don‚Äôt have that kind of funding or backing from friends.

So here I am, reaching out to you, fellow redditors. If you've experienced losses in investments that didn‚Äôt ruin your life but gave you something to laugh about, come trade $WOLOSR on pump fun. Let‚Äôs build this meme together. Who knows‚Äîmaybe losers can be winners too! If the coin gains traction, I plan to build a website (I already own the domain) and grow the community

Any thoughts on Sleepless AI? Here‚Äôs why I paid attention to this project: ,2,1greilp,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1greilp/any_thoughts_on_sleepless_ai_heres_why_i_paid/,32,"Sleepless AI is a relatively new altcoin focused on building a decentralized AI ecosystem. Here‚Äôs why I supported this project, and want to hear your thoughts: 

üíª Real Utility Without Hype

The project is building a platform where developers can create and deploy AI-driven applications on the blockchain. The idea is to democratize access to AI tools and make them available to individuals and businesses without the need for centralized tech giants. This can be a game-changer in fields like predictive analytics, data processing, automation, and personalized AI solutions.

‚≠êÔ∏è Influential Support 

While it‚Äôs common to see celebrities or influencers pump coins without understanding their utility, Sleepless AI has attracted attention from several well-known figures in the tech and crypto community. Although there are no official endorsements yet, there were posts from prominent voices like Elon Musk. 

‚ù§Ô∏è Branding 

The project aims to develop AI technologies that are accessible and beneficial to a wide audience, rather than concentrating power in the hands of a few large companies. I consider ""heart"" in its branding as a symbol of its commitment to creating AI that prioritizes user privacy, transparency, and real-world utility.

üôåüèº Transparency and Team 

The Sleepless AI team is highly active and transparent about their progress. They regularly engage with the community on platforms like Telegram, Discord, and X, sharing updates about development milestones, partnerships, and upcoming features. This level of transparency helps build trust and ensures that the project is moving in the right direction. 

üìä The team has a detailed roadmap (Marketplace, 
Staking and Yield Farming, Partnerships with AI Research Labs) 

üåê Community 

Sleepless AI is building a decentralized governance model, where token holders can vote on key decisions, from protocol upgrades to funding new AI projects. This gives the community real influence over the direction of the platform, aligning it with the ethos of decentralization and user empowerment.

üìà Future 

Sleepless AI is still in its early stages, with a relatively low market cap compared to more established projects like SingularityNET (AGIX) or Fetch.ai (FET). This gives it significant room for growth, especially if the project gains traction and delivers on its roadmap. As the demand for AI services continues to rise, I think, the potential for Sleepless AI to carve out a niche in this rapidly expanding market is promising.

What do you think about Sleepless AI? Have you looked into its potential?

Let's Fuckin Go! + LEGO = $LFGO



The above is a power, common mantra not only in the crypto space, but the wider world as a whole, and we are the embodiment of it. By combining LFG with LEGO and using AI to brickify just about anything inside and outside the crypto space - we meme the memes, adapt to new trends and can quickly play into any new metas.



With nothing but insane normie appeal, LFGO is a super fun, adaptable concept, and branding that is instantly recognisable, yet still original in so many ways! 



LFGO started its life on pump fun back on April 8th, where it quickly gained popularity. However, the original Dev pulled the rug and the community picked up the pieces and took over. And what a take over it was. Grabbing the bull by the horns, the dedicated team and community have taken this project from strength to strength. They've taken a simple idea and turned it into a fully functioning crypto project, with a core team of 37 working around the scenes and nothing but a bright future ahead.



Oh, and did we mention that LFGO has got the BEST website in crypto, showcasing the amazing content all created by the community - come and take a look!

Inspired by Peanut, a pet squirrel known for doing tricks in tiny hats on social media, the coin has struck a strong emotional chord with fans.  
  
The coin's exposure grew with its listing on Bitget, and shortly after, Binance announced it would list PNUT, sparking even more interest. This led to a significant rise in its market cap, from $129 million to $447.5 million, before stabilizing around $422 million, with a current price above $0.41.  
  
In addition to its growing popularity, Bitget is running a campaign where users can win $10‚Äì$20 worth of PNUT tokens by participating.   
  
At its core, PNUT shows that cryptocurrency can be about more than just profit. It taps into cultural moments and brings people together over shared emotions, proving how meme coins can build strong communities.

",2,1gpxmyj,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1gpxmyj/the_rise_of_peaq_a_new_era_for_machine_economy/,15,"on the search for the next PNUT and DOGE i stumbled upon some new projects and was waiting for some nice price action and i saw PEAQ, At its core, peaq is engineered to facilitate the seamless integration of machines, devices, and physical infrastructure into a decentralized, blockchain-based economy. This vision is realized through:  
  
**Decentralized Governance and Utility**: peaq provides the infrastructure for machines to operate autonomously, offering services across various dimensions - from land-based vehicles to drones in the sky or even equipment in space. This not only decentralizes control but also democratizes access, aligning with the ethos of Web3 where users and machines can interact without intermediaries.  
  
**Ecosystem Richness:** The ecosystem of peaq is vibrant, supporting over 30 projects with more than 850,000 devices connected. These projects range from energy management to mobility solutions, each designed to leverage the blockchain's capabilities to provide real-world services. This extensive network showcases peaq's commitment to not just theoretical blockchain potentials but actual, tangible applications.  
  
Users can stake Bitget's BGB or USDT to earn from a reward pool of 12,125,000 PEAQ tokens. This initiative not only incentivizes early adoption but also spreads awareness and investment in peaq's technology. The event runs from November 12 to November 19, 2024, offering a tangible way for crypto users to engage with peaq's ecosystem.  
  
peaq is not merely participating in the blockchain revolution; it's leading a charge towards a new paradigm of physical and digital integration. what's your thought on the project Growth ?

How about bringing an old coin to life? ,4,1gpguez,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1gpguez/how_about_bringing_an_old_coin_to_life/,48,"I have been looking into bitcoin alternatives which have been there for a while and not so popular due to lack of listing or the devs wanted it that way. 

One of those coins is HUSH. During 2017 bull market it has performed but then a downward spiral. But surpirsingly HUSH still has a strong dev team doing frequent releases. Its PoW coin and very similar profile and supply like #Bitcoin. Those Who Missed Out on #Bitcoin can still create an opportunity for their own good.

I have been looking into other altcoins as well, but the market is saturated with 10s of 1000s of coins. Only insiders are making money out of it. What about normal retailers. Normal people who wants to invest? Nobody cares about them really. You either fall into a scam or buy a coin which has grown to its potential. I am talking about people who can only invest in 100s.

So why not try out a coin which has been there for a while, good dev support and wallets. Be the early buyers with very little money. Just invest 10 dollars. It's nothing to lose. 

By the way, HUSH is not easy to buy. It's on TradeOgre or you can mine it. For a normal person TradeOgre will work better.

Think about it fellow reddit people. Is 10 dollars to much to lose to try something out.

Please note this is not for people who had success in trading. But for retailers getting into the crypto market very late.

**What is $DRF?**

DRIFE is a decentralized ride-hailing platform that utilizes blockchain technology to create a peer-to-peer network for drivers and riders. The platform operates on the DRF token, which serves as the native currency for all transactions on the platform. The primary goal of DRIFE is to revolutionize the traditional ride-hailing industry by creating a more transparent, secure, and cost-effective system that benefits both drivers and riders.

Unlike traditional ride-hailing platforms, DRIFE is a decentralized platform that eliminates intermediaries, giving riders and drivers more control over their interactions. By leveraging blockchain technology, DRIFE creates a trustless and transparent environment that enables direct peer-to-peer interactions between riders and drivers. This direct connection allows for more personalized and customized ride-hailing experiences, where riders can choose drivers based on specific criteria, such as driver rating, car type, and other preferences.

**What solutions $DRF give to the ride-hailing industry?**

The ride-hailing industry is facing a range of issues that are affecting both drivers and passengers. These issues include high commissions, platform-dictated pricing, lack of transparency and freedom, closed governance, and no loyalty.

We can name few more problems in other competitors ‚Äì sky-rocketing commissions, platform-dictated pricings, lack of transparency and freedom, closed governance, no loyalty and more.

How does DRIFE deal with those problems exactly?

DRIFE offers innovative solutions to some of the key challenges faced by traditional ride-hailing services. Its zero-commission structure, market-dictated pricing, transparency and freedom to choose an open governance model, and incentivized participation make it a unique and sustainable platform that benefits both riders and drivers.

* No commission - One of the key features of DRIFE is its zero-commission structure. Unlike traditional ride-hailing services, DRIFE does not charge drivers any commission fees for using its platform to connect with riders. This leads to better incomes for drivers who can pass on some of these benefits to riders in the form of reduced commuting costs.
* Market-Dictated Pricing - DRIFE's model offers a unique dynamic pricing mechanism that is based on an auction model. This allows market forces to determine the prices for each ride, rather than a fixed pricing system that is imposed by the platform. The middleman's profit is also eliminated, which means that the prices are even lower for riders, while drivers receive higher incomes for their services.
* Transparency & Freedom to Choose - Transparency and freedom of choice are essential features of the DRIFE platform. The platform's decentralized mobility marketplace and flexible peer-to-peer design give riders and drivers greater control over their experience. Riders can select drivers based on various criteria, such as rating, fare price, pickup time, or specific needs, like child seats or disability access.
* Open Governance - DRIFE's open governance model is a unique approach that aims to create a self-sustaining ecosystem where every stakeholder plays an important role in its growth and maintenance. This is achieved through a franchise model that allows entities such as riders, drivers, fleet owners, and local transportation and logistics companies to govern themselves in a fair and efficient way.
* Incentivized Participation - DRIFE's rewards program is a key aspect of incentivizing participation from both drivers and riders on the platform. By offering rewards for active engagement, DRIFE encourages users to complete rides, provide feedback, and participate in the platform's governance process. These rewards can come in the form of DRF tokens or other perks, which can be used to redeem discounts, free rides, or other benefits

**Do $DRF have a working referral system?**

The Drife team have organized and explained in depth their loyalty and referral system. You can check it out in their whitepaper following this link:

[https://drife.gitbook.io/white-paper/tokenomics](https://drife.gitbook.io/white-paper/tokenomics)

**What is the future development plan of $DRF?**

Integration with other modes of transportation - DRIFE plans to integrate with other modes of transportation, such as public transit, to provide riders with a seamless and convenient end-to-end transportation experience.

* International expansion - DRIFE aims to expand its services to other countries, providing riders and drivers around the world with access to its platform.
* Continued technological Advancements - DRIFE will continue to develop and implement new technologies, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, to improve the ride-hailing experience for its users.
* DRIFE is exploring a new infrastructure layer designed exclusively for mobility, utilizing mobility primitives as a crucial part of the blockchain. This unique approach has the potential to foster innovation in the industry by enabling the community to build mobility-specific use cases.

**Serenity Shield: Secure Data Storage and Digital Inheritance for the Web3 Era**

As our lives become increasingly digital, questions about data security and accessibility for future generations are more relevant than ever. Enter **Serenity Shield**‚Äîan innovative platform designed for secure data storage and digital inheritance, utilizing decentralized blockchain technology. By offering unique solutions for both individual and business users, Serenity Shield is redefining how we think about digital assets and the importance of preserving them for the future.

# What is Serenity Shield?

Serenity Shield is a decentralized platform that leverages blockchain to securely store various types of digital files‚Äîbe it text, audio, video, or sensitive documents. The platform prioritizes data privacy and autonomy, allowing users to maintain full control over their data without relying on traditional, centralized systems.

One of Serenity Shield‚Äôs key features is its **digital inheritance protocol**. Users can designate a trusted individual to inherit access to their digital assets if they are unable to access them, ensuring that valuable data, from personal documents to financial assets, remains accessible to designated parties. This feature addresses a critical gap in today‚Äôs digital landscape, where many assets can be lost if access keys are forgotten or unavailable.

# Key Features of Serenity Shield

1. **Data Security and Privacy** Serenity Shield uses advanced encryption techniques combined with data sharding, splitting data into multiple fragments that are encrypted and stored across various nodes. This not only enhances security but also ensures that even in the event of a breach, no single entity has access to complete data.
2. **Inheritance Protocol** Serenity Shield‚Äôs inheritance system is unique in that it allows users to divide access keys into three encrypted NFTs (non-fungible tokens), one held by the user, one by the heir, and one by Serenity Shield. This ‚Äútwo-out-of-three‚Äù model ensures data security while offering an efficient way to transfer digital assets in unforeseen circumstances.
3. **SERSH Utility Token** Serenity Shield has its own utility token, **SERSH**, which users can use for transactions on the platform, including storage fees. The deflationary nature of the token, alongside staking and revenue-sharing opportunities, makes it an attractive asset within the ecosystem.

# Who Can Benefit from Serenity Shield?

Serenity Shield is beneficial to both **individuals** and **businesses**. Individuals can securely store personal files, financial documents, media, or legal records, while businesses in sectors like healthcare, finance, and telecommunications‚Äîwhere data privacy is paramount‚Äîcan use Serenity Shield for secure and transparent data management.

# A Vision for the Future

Serenity Shield envisions bridging the gap between traditional (Web2) and decentralized (Web3) technologies by building a robust digital storage and inheritance system adaptable to future innovations. The platform‚Äôs focus on scalability and sustainability aims to create a global, decentralized network that is self-sustaining, reliable, and highly secure.

In a world where digital assets are only growing in value and importance, Serenity Shield offers a pioneering solution to keep them safe and accessible for generations to come. Whether for personal use or business needs, Serenity Shield is leading the charge toward a more secure, decentralized future for data management and digital inheritance.

Exploring the Impact of Liquid Staking on Ethereum and DeFi,2,1glw9zj,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1glw9zj/exploring_the_impact_of_liquid_staking_on/,42,"Liquid staking has transformed the Ethereum ecosystem by allowing users to earn staking rewards without fully locking up their assets. Unlike traditional staking, liquid staking enables users to earn rewards while retaining access to their staked assets, which can then be deployed in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. This flexibility maximizes earning potential and optimizes capital efficiency within the DeFi landscape.  
  
A key player in this space, Swell Network, leverages Ethereum‚Äôs secure infrastructure to provide innovative liquidity staking solutions. With Swell, users not only support the Ethereum network through staking but also access DeFi applications to earn additional returns on staked assets. This dual approach enhances the staking experience, making it more flexible and accessible.  
  
Swell has recently broadened its presence by listing on centralized exchanges, opening up more avenues for user engagement. With initiatives like Launchpool, PoolX and CandyBomb on Bitget, Swell now offers users extra ways to earn and get involved in the expanding DeFi ecosystem. As Swell Network continues to innovate, its progress will be worth following as it influences the future of Ethereum-based DeFi and liquid staking.

Anime's got a grip on the world like no other, with fans ready to dive into any rabbit hole where their beloved characters and stories might pop up. Now, imagine that fervor channeled into crypto investments.   
  
Here's where projects like RoOLZ ($GODL) come into play. They're not just riding the crypto wave; they're surfing it with an anime board. Think about it: if an anime gets millions of views, shares, and tweets, what happens when you throw in crypto?   
  
You get a community of fans who might not know the ins and outs of blockchain but are all in for the culture.  
The impact on exposure? Skyrocketing.   
  
When Bitget or any platform throws in those deposit rewards, it's like adding rocket fuel. It's not just about the tech or the utility; it's about creating a buzz, a movement. Anime fans are already used to spending on merchandise, so why not on digital assets that blend their passion with potential profit?  
  
Now, let's chat about your investment dilemma. You're not alone in seeing the potential here.

Zero-knowledge rollups are changing the game for Ethereum scaling by enabling off-chain transactions while keeping data secure and trustworthy. Projects like zkSync, Scroll and StarkWare are at the forefront of this innovation, helping decentralized applications run more efficiently.

Zircuit is part of this movement, focusing on both efficiency and security. Its hybrid architecture uses zero-knowledge proofs alongside full Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility, allowing for faster transactions and lower fees.

With an AI-driven security system that monitors for threats, Zircuit creates a safe environment for users and developers. It has gained significant traction, reaching a peak total value locked (TVL) of $3.7 billion.

Following the recent launch of Mainnet Phase 1 and ZRC token claims for early participants, Zircuit is now available for pre-market trading on Bitget, giving early investors a chance to get involved and they have a nice history during there pre-market.

What are your thoughts on Zircuit‚Äôs future in the DeFi space?

It was inspired by Shai Wyborski's pet cat Nacho! lol. Shai is one of the main researchers and founders of Kaspa. He even thanked Nacho cat on his graduation! This token was 100% fairly minted. This token also has the highest number of holders as of today. Not many wallets hold more than 1% supply of Nacho. Great distribution tbh. It has the best background story for a meme coin on Kaspa, in my opinion.

official website: nachowyborski .xyz  
Coinmarketcap: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/nacho-the-kat/

Current market cap: $42m 

More details about the token: [https://kas.fyi/token/krc20/NACHO](https://kas.fyi/token/krc20/NACHO)

This token can be bought on KSPR bot: Link can be found on [kas.fyi](http://kas.fyi) website

The NACHO team is pretty good. I attended their call on discord recently. The creators were patient in explaining everything. The immediate targets on the roadmap include CEX listing, starting a Kaspa pool, improving Governance, and creating NFT collection. The roadmap for next year is not ready yet. They have something called Kaspa Alliance for Transparency for 2025.

I feel that one meme coin on each chain will have 3-5% of main chain's market cap during the bull run. The second best might have 2-3% of main chain's market cap. Nacho is the main contender for the first place on Kaspa network. Once it gets listed on CEX, it will explode for sure. I cannot wait for the bull run! Even if it captures 1% of Kaspa's market cap during peak bull run, it is gonna have a MC of $300m, assuming Kaspa crosses $1(I am sure that this is inevitable).

I also see that the team has been collecting funds for CEX listing. 

Nacho can be traded on:

Rising during green market and holding during big market drops. And this is exactly what separates good coins like $HEGE from shitcoins that will sooner or later end up being rugged.

But this is not what I want to talk about today.

I want to talk about the generosity of $HEGE community and about the competitions they are holding every once in a while. And I am not talking about small prizes there. Every competition has 1k+ in prize-pool usually divided between 3-6 people.

And I think that $250 for making a simple Reddit posts or Tiktok videos is definitely worth it.

So first, let me tell you about my experience with $HEGE.

I first found $HEGE when it was at 700k market cap. I bought it here and sold for 2x without even joining the TG. But then I saw it absolutely flew and had to join. In only 1 month I won around 150k $HEGE tokens from competitions. That is around $4,5k at ATH and I never sold a single token.

And now you have a chance to win a giveaway too. The community is sending thousands of dollars to people making Reddit posts. The more you work, the more money you get. Simple as that.

And because the community is working hard every day, $HEGE is already listed on 4 exchanges and even appeared on Binance AMA, it is a no brainer here at 8mil market cap. I said it 2 months ago and I will say it again.

$HEGE will reach 100mil+ this bullrun!

So join our Telegram and take part in one of the comps to win a bag of $HEGE. And who knows, maybe you will end up making a lot of money.

DEAI üåü: The Emerging AI-Driven Blockchain Solution ,2,1gfhulb,altcoin,https://i.redd.it/yakshho9vuxd1.jpeg,70,"DEAI, an emerging player in the blockchain space, is setting its sights on artificial intelligence, positioning itself as a successor to TAO. DEAI‚Äôs mission is to integrate AI capabilities directly into blockchain infrastructure, allowing the network to support advanced AI-based applications. This concept places DEAI at the intersection of two rapidly growing sectors‚Äîblockchain and AI‚Äîcreating a unique space where it can cater to projects that require both the security of blockchain and the analytical power of AI.
As an ‚ÄúAI chain,‚Äù DEAI leverages machine learning algorithms within its network to enhance transaction processing, automate various aspects of governance and enable advanced data analytics directly on-chain. This means that applications built on DEAI could potentially access AI-driven insights, automate decision-making processes, and even adapt over time based on the data they interact with. Given the increasing demand for AI and blockchain applications, DEAI is well-positioned to capture attention from projects seeking to leverage both technologies.
Since reaching a low, DEAI has shown promising upward momentum, and many analysts predict it could soon revisit its all-time high (ATH) in the $1.4 to $1.5 range. However, achieving new highs will require sustained development, adoption, and community support. DEAI‚Äôs current market position is still young, which provides an attractive opportunity for early investors, though it‚Äôs crucial to recognize that this asset may require a longer holding period to reach its full potential. The AI-driven nature of DEAI makes it a forward-looking addition to any portfolio, especially for those interested in the intersection of artificial intelligence and decentralized technology.

Kaspa (KAS) ü¶æ: Redefining Blockchain Through High-Speed Block Production,3,1gfht9d,altcoin,https://i.redd.it/y9xrqz7quuxd1.jpeg,63,"Kaspa is a Layer 1 blockchain that sets itself apart with a unique technology known as blockDAG (Directed Acyclic Graph). Traditional blockchains, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, follow a linear structure where one block follows the next. Kaspa, however, employs a blockDAG, allowing multiple blocks to be generated and confirmed simultaneously, which significantly increases throughput and lowers confirmation times. In practical terms, this means Kaspa can handle a much higher number of transactions per second compared to traditional blockchain designs, positioning it as a highly scalable solution for a variety of use cases.
In the world of Layer 1 blockchains, scalability is a recurring challenge. Many networks struggle to balance speed, decentralization, and security‚Äîa problem known as the blockchain trilemma. Kaspa‚Äôs approach is groundbreaking because it essentially bypasses this trilemma by creating a network where transaction speed and decentralization do not come at the expense of security. With the potential to produce 10 blocks per second, Kaspa has one of the fastest block production rates in the industry, making it suitable for high-frequency applications such as decentralized exchanges, gaming, and financial transactions.
Kaspa‚Äôs recent performance on the charts shows a corrective wave pattern, suggesting it may currently be undergoing a short-term retracement. This could be a buying opportunity for long-term investors, especially if Kaspa finds support at key Fibonacci retracement levels around $0.066 and $0.08. The price is also approaching a critical area on its exponential moving average (EMA), which has historically provided a strong support base during downturns. While it‚Äôs experiencing a consolidation phase, Kaspa‚Äôs fundamentals remain robust, and its unique technology positions it as a potential leader in blockchain scalability.

Solana's Rise Fuels DeFi Growth and Staking Opportunities,0,1gazdmg,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1gazdmg/solanas_rise_fuels_defi_growth_and_staking/,66,"Solana (SOL) has experienced a notable boost in performance in the past few months, mainly thanks to its distinctive blockchain technology providing high speed, affordable transactions, and scalability. The improved performance boosts user satisfaction and backs the expanding network of decentralized applications (dApps) and DeFi projects, establishing Solana as a top competitor in the cryptocurrency industry.  
  
Bitget and Binance are now offering restaking services for SOL in order to capitalize on Solana's growing popularity, enabling users to earn BNSol and BGSol recpectively which can be used for restaking. The APR (Binance 10.45% and Bitget 22%) on these exchanges further encourages users to stake their sol on this platform.  
  
Bitget recently launch its BGSOL staking which has exceeded $10 million in under 24 hours, demonstrating significant user engagement. Users can restake BGSol on Bitget flexible saving to earn more APR. This shows exchanges increase interest in deFi and could position Sol as the top token soon.

AI meta Waking Up back we are back ,3,1g88p14,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1g88p14/ai_meta_waking_up_back_we_are_back/,75,"Most ppl clearly missed $GOAT as a main runner, which is totally understandable.

If they couldn‚Äôt get themselves to buy a significant chunk of $GOAT at a higher valuation, then they naturally chase beta plays.

And here there are plenty, telegram chats are full of new tickers. But all of these play out the same way - some ppl catch them early, they get shilled, have a mega pump, early buyers take profits and most of these just fizzle out and become irrelevant...

Unless they have staying power - which can happen for several reasons (eg good narrative, supply control, good marketing etc)

If you look at today‚Äôs situation, memecoins seem to hit a wall at around 20M market cap and they are now tradable on Bitget with over 5 million Tx in the last 24 hours.

What you want to focus on is the tokens that break that resistance; or before they do, the ones that clearly

show higher lows being put in and buy-side demand coming through (with clear reasons)

Right now, $GOAT is the meta creator and clear leader. You want to own that. how many of these beta plays

Lets Talk about the Alpha,11,1g58ere,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1g58ere/lets_talk_about_the_alpha/,37,"For those managing concerns or doing their research -

*there are fudders out there. those who sold the dip, not the high.*

*those who see kendu reaching people who they could have scammed.*

*those who have never held kendu and are inexplicably stalking comments to fud.*

# Do you know what a rug is?

First, if this was a rug, it would have been done far more aggressively all the way down the line from the much larger MC (we were at 280). We also would be much lower than 50m MC.¬†If you spend any amount of time watching meme coin launches you'll learn what real rugs and honey pot projects are.

The amount of time Miazaki spends with the community weekly for the past 7 months in and of itself suggests otherwise. Ignoring everything else, this is wildly elaborate for such a small little return.

Kendu is backed by exceptional high audit scores (links in the post below) and low volatility (you're not going to lose your money).

The earth isn't flat and this isn't a rug. Just breath.

# Trading Volume vs. Holder Count

*First, make sure you're monitoring the right screeners that account for CEX and DEX.* Most that I'm aware of are buying Kendu from DEX or straight from their wallets.

Volume is lower than we'd like, that's true. We've got cult-like holders. Lots of them. 14.4k and growing daily to be exact. Nonetheless, Kendu continues to hold a higher buyer to seller ratio and so continues to grow.

Kendu is looking to approach this differently, highlighted in the Alpha below.

We're also here without paying for ads or KOL that could artificially pump a coin before cashing out and crashing the project. I was in an X spaces the other day where several KOLs were laughing about revenge rugging projects selling their holdings out of spite for one or more of its holders. You can invest in today's hype if you want, but you better hope you don't lose your money because of some vendetta you were unaware of.

# The $280 million marketcap thats used as FUD.

*Kendu hit that $280m mark WITHIN 2 months of launch with no paid marketing or KOLs.* **Kendu got there with organic shilling and 7k holders.**

**We now have 14.5k holders.** What do you think we Kendu with that?

What is crazy is that the community believes we got there too soon because we weren't as distributed and layered with all the Alpha that I get in to below that would actually sustain and grow that kind of market cap.

What's even crazier is that hitting $280 million in 2 months with 7k holders and no paid advertising/KOLs is the only thing fudders can ever point to as the only real ""fud"".

Redistributing, landing, consolidating and organically finding support at $50 million within 7 months without any paid advertising or KOLs is something worth fading for the same fudders that claim rug without even knowing what term really means.

***Kendu doesn‚Äôt have sell outs.***¬†

# Dislike ""The Process""?

For those who complain about what Miazaki sounds like, or the things he says, then consider asking yourself this question: wtf do you think you sound like when you tell your normie friends and family that you invest in memecoins? Go invest $1k in re tard coin or pepes peepee and then look your dad in the eyes when you tell him.

Don't point a finger before looking in the mirror.¬†Or, as a wise philosopher once said, ""check yourself before you wreck yourself"" - I. Cube.

The consolidation curve that Kendu is in from ATH is not uncommon for any memecoin that lives for 24hrs or longer. It‚Äôs a macro cycle that only gets higher highs and higher lows as it consolidates before the next pump. Then, rinse and repeat.

# Miazaki is not working alone.

He has a team, and has highlighted the process in his ongoing Medium articles linked below. He also has a regular X spaces and Telegram video chats where anybody can ask him questions. Have one? Hop in and ask yourself.

[What. Why. Where. Who. - The path by Kendu Miazaki](https://medium.com/@kendumiazaki)

***\*To be clear a question means A Question. Not complaining, spreading fud and disinformation while providing no substantive input or clear insight being requested\****

# The Alpha

What is uncommon about Kendu‚Äôs marketing approach is that Kendu is creating products that it then markets in order to advertise the coin. In other words, it's providing investors something tangible as a means to advertise the token.

This in turn:

* Focuses on IRL shilling just as much as online. ***By hosting video competitions giving away rewards like $1billion Kendu (\~$60k USD) and an ongoing $50million Kendu competition*** that promote capturing the most creative, unhinged approach to shilling, and sending it. Dozens of average everyday holders have gotten paid out .. what kind of scams pays out real rewards?¬†
* Creates and promotes IRL products and events like Kendu Energy, Kendu Coffee, Kendu supplements, Kendu Nights, etc. These are owned and managed by random, individual entrepreneurs within Kendu, not associated with leadership, and most having joined after I came in. There are 10k Kendu Energy drinks being planned for free distribution at universities in Australia for free as I type this. There is Kendu coffee being served to celebrities on movie sets. They are also being sold in more and more locations, and you'll see one soon. We are everywhere IRL.¬†
* Replaces KOLs that control enough of the coin supply to rug a project when they inevitably cash out. Instead, Kendu relies on its community to shill. And shill they do, so aggressively that we often get confused for bots. We are people and we are working for our bags.¬†
* Builds an ecosystem that currently contains the NFT marketplace that gives holders an ownership stake that generates margin-based profits while utilizing those same profits to sustain the coin and the community. It‚Äôs new and it is growing.¬†

***This will make Kendu bear market proof.***

Kendu billboards are going up, Kendu stickers are being plastered, and countless merch being made.¬†

-All of this without even getting into CoinBase, ties to Shiba Inu devs, and etcetera-

**Kendu is promoting to the masses because it intends on capturing the normie masses. Not only bringing normies into Kendu, but bringing them to Crypto.**¬†

Kendu isn‚Äôt just a culty memecoin, it‚Äôs a marketing empire in the making that is looking to influence crypto but redefining how a coin can grow.¬†

The united, focused conviction Kendu holders have reminds me of the effect that roaring kitty and gamestop investors had on traditional markets a few years ago.

Kendu is aiming to do the same in crypto.

***So, feel free to buy in at another coin, but you might be buying at their top. At Kendu today, you know you‚Äôre buying at the retested, supported bottom.*** ¬†

**- At Kendu Inu, we do not gamble, we fuckin work -**

Happy bull run to all.

OMNIA Protocol emerges as a pioneering force in this arena, offering a comprehensive Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN) that simplifies blockchain access for developers, businesses, and individuals alike.

OMNIA's recent Initial DEX Offering (IDO) on ChainGPT Pad was a resounding success, selling out within seconds and raising a substantial $700,000. This remarkable achievement underscores the significant potential and market demand for OMNIA's innovative approach to decentralized infrastructure. The over 2,038 participants who contributed to the IDO demonstrated a strong belief in OMNIA's ability to revolutionize the way we interact with blockchain networks.

One of OMNIA's key strengths lies in its ability to address a critical challenge within the blockchain ecosystem: the complexity of setting up blockchain access points. For many individuals and businesses, the technical intricacies involved in establishing these access points can be a significant barrier to entry. OMNIA elegantly overcomes this hurdle by providing a seamless and user-friendly interface that allows users to interact with decentralized networks without the need for extensive technical knowledge.

The sold-out IDO serves as a testament to the excitement and anticipation surrounding OMNIA's offerings. As the project continues to gain momentum, the upcoming listing on top exchanges on October 15th presents a new opportunity for individuals to invest in the future of decentralized network access and the listing is upcoming on several cex inclusing Bitget. bullish in this project frrrr    
  
OMNIA's commitment to providing a user-friendly and secure platform positions it as a valuable asset for those seeking to participate in the growth and development of the blockchain ecosystem.

coming across many projects offering staking and restaking which is liquid ofcourse, for me am planning to dominate my prowess to just one of it and put more interest on Puffer Finance. This platform stands out with its fun, community driven approach to memecoins, allowing users to explore a variety of meme based digital assets, trade in a marketplace and also participate in liquidity pools while enjoying the vibrant meme culture.  
  
What really stood out for me is how Puffer Finance combines liquid staking with restaking, enabling users to access their staked assets while continuing to earn rewards. This feature boosts investment efficiency and opens up more opportunities in the DeFi space.  
  
Puffer Finance also let users create their own memecoins and actively participate in governance, prioritizing transparency, security and fairness. With tools for discovering new memecoins and managing crypto investments, Puffer Finance fosters a lively community eager to innovate and shape the future of meme based cryptos.   
  
With the $PUFFER token set to list on October 14 which is today on various exchanges, users can take advantage of events like PoolX, Launchpool and Candybomb to earn more $PUFFER through staking and trading on Bitget and many others cex.

Some huge news are coming this month and you definitely do not want to miss this.

The market cap of cat themed memecoins is 10 times lower than the market cap of dog memecoins. This is why I believe we are just a few months away from the biggest cat season ever. And Simon‚Äôs Cat will be the leading coin of this meta for sure.

$CAT might look like a basic cat coin but opposite is the truth. The team behind $CAT is experienced, rich and know exactly what to do and how to do it to make this project really reach billions.

And the meme itself definitely deserves billions cause Simon‚Äôs Cat is a world-wide known cartoon character + the team is making insane high-quality memes that trend on all their socials.

They already listed $CAT on the majority of the biggest exchanges in the world like OKX, [Gate.io](http://Gate.io), KuCoin or HTX.

And the community is also absolutely insane. With nearly 230k holders, 60k Telegram members and insane 200k X followers. It is just a matter of time until we reach billions because the community members are helping with everything they can to pump their bags and help $CAT go where it belongs.

Worth mentioning is also the fact that the team burned around $25M worth of tokens and made a partnership with FLOKI, one of the biggest memecoins ever.

Honestly, don‚Äôt sleep on this. Projects like $CAT do not stay under billion for too long so it is just a matter of time until Binance lists $CAT and it will become one of the biggest memecoins ever.

Can $CATS Make a Comeback? Token Faces Uncertainty After Price Drop and Bold New Moves,2,1g00lcl,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1g00lcl/can_cats_make_a_comeback_token_faces_uncertainty/,22,"The $CATS token hit the market with excitement, but its low market cap quickly raised red flags for investors. After an early price surge, it soon crashed to $0.0000576, following the same path as other struggling tokens like $DOGS.

  
Right now, $CATS is priced at $0.0001228, down 75% from its peak. Compared to $DOGS, which boasts a market cap of $401.96 million, $CATS sits far behind at just $73.78 million. The rapid price drop has left the token oversold, hinting at a possible rebound, though market confidence is still shaky.

  
In a bid to bring traders back, the Bitget team has launched the CATS x Bitget Fortune Ticket event. For every $10 of $CATS trades, participants earn tickets for a chance to win prizes. This event, running until Oct 14, is designed to boost short-term trading and spark new interest in the token.

  
Adding to the mix, the announcement of Season 2 has triggered rumors of a potential buyback strategy, which could help drive prices higher. If successful, $CATS could climb to $0.0003 or more. But if the plan doesn‚Äôt deliver, the token could see further losses.

  
In short, $CATS is a risky, speculative investment. Its future depends on how well the team executes their upcoming strategies. Investors should proceed with caution and watch developments closely.

But you need to ask yourself, why did they care to name drop them at all?  It has to do with the community and their dedication, convinction, unhingedness, and engagement.  Sure there is manipulation within the crypto space, especially in the DeFi space, but there are some standout projects that have formed cult-like communities and those will eventually beat out the cabal coins (like we're seeing now).  I respect any project that can ride a lengthy consolidation down as far as it needs to go before it finally skyrockets and I love to see projects that have been around for a long time finally get their time in the spotlight.  You need to study these highly successful projects and pay attention to why they exploded.  

Enter Kendu Inu  

Kendu Inu is over 7 months old now and the engagement from the community hasn't faltered in the slightest.  Since day one it's been instilled that nobody is coming to save us, and there are no planned catalysts that will grow the project.  The growth relies on the strength and activity of the community; it's that simple.  This project is absolutely destined for multi-billions in marketcap.  The community is the most active and convicted community that you will find in crypto.  I don't look at the chart anymore because I've learned that's not what makes a project great.  

I used to be pretty critical of projects that had ""bad"" charts but my opinion has changed as I've become more familiar with DeFi.  Now I judge them more based on community activity.  Dead communities and big charts all have their limits, but if you find a project like Kendu Inu where the community is as active as it is, there literally is no limit to how big we can become; I'm talking an infinitely scalable project.  Another important thing to add, Kendu Inu is at a \~50M marketcap which is nothing to scoff at either.  99% of projects would kill to have \~50M be their floor.  Basically what I'm saying is, the game is simple, but that doesn't mean it's easy.  That's why I love to think back to the Kendu motto:  

""We don't gamble, we work""

You can see firsthand from the polls on twitter how much activity the Kendu Inu commmunity puts out whenever an opportunity presents itself.  When these polls show up, keep in mind we don't just simply vote, we absolutely show out in the comment sections as well which is why I'll provide links to the polls so you can check for yourself.  

\*Please note, I am leaving the names of the others projects not in an attempt to bash them and their communities, but rather to be transparent about who else participated in the polls.  I do not have any negative feelings towards any other community, if anything I would encourage everyone to understand that you ultimately have to work for your bag to get the recognition that you deserve!

BUIDL with Privacy4Web3 Hackathon 2.0 - All You Need to Know - Part 2,1,1fystnu,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1fystnu/buidl_with_privacy4web3_hackathon_20_all_you_need/,26,"Building new projects, testing out and pushing the limits of the technology and infrastructure, and helping contribute to the growth of an ecosystem are some of the top reasons hackathons are so popular among developers as well as the blockchain protocols. Oasis, as the pioneer of smart privacy for web3 and AI, has advanced DeCC and DeAI capabilities in making hackathons ground zero for innovation. Buoyed by the response and success of last year, the [second edition of Privacy4Web3 (P4W3) hackathon](https://oasisprotocol.org/hackathon) is up and running, with the deadline on Nov 11, 2024.

In the [first part of this series](https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1fr8waq/buidl_with_privacy4web3_hackathon_20_all_you_need/), we talked about the protocols coming together with Oasis - Ocean Protocol, Aethir, Apillon, Dedaub, PixelRealm, and Zero1 Labs, in making this hackathon one of the largest in terms of bounties, scope, and impact, and what kind of next-gen projects we anticipate will get BUIDL-ed. Let's now go over the submission requirements and judging criteria for the [participants](https://dorahacks.io/hackathon/p4w3/hackers) (60+ and counting).

**Submission Requirements**

* A short summary of the project that outlines its description and milestones for development.
* A link to the project's open-source code repository for judging and testing. 
* Smart contract deployment links (addresses on [Sapphire](https://oasisprotocol.org/sapphire) mainnet or testnet) for the project.
* A demo video (less than 5 minutes) of the project and the inspiration behind it - uploaded to YouTube, Vimeo, or a similar site and made public.
* All projects must use Sapphire or [ROFL](https://oasisprotocol.org/decentralized-ai#rofl) (Runtime OFf-chain Logic). Projects built using other Oasis infrastructure will not qualify for the hackathon.

**Judging Criteria**

The P4W3 hackathon 2.0 is bound to have a plethora of submissions, and while the scope of the bounties would differ, they will have some common judging criteria - implementation quality, potential impact, confidentiality solutions in use, ease of user experience, and level of innovation.

To help and inspire participants, Oasis has organized a slew of sessions and workshops. Check them out.

P.S.: It is worth noting that Oasis is a¬†[privacy-first blockchain and not a privacy coin](https://oasisprotocol.org/blog/confidential-computing-platform-not-privacy-coin-explainer), and its token,¬†[Rose](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/oasis-network/), is only to make the protocol decentralized through staking and delegation at the consensus layer, and using for transaction fees.",2024-10-08 00:47:26,1728366446.0
Looking for the next 1B+ memecoin? $CAT on BNB is the one!,9,1fxlwzi,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1fxlwzi/looking_for_the_next_1b_memecoin_cat_on_bnb_is/,30,"I gotta tell you about a coin that is about to blow up. I am talking about $CAT.

The market cap of cat themed memecoins is 10 times lower than the market cap of dog memecoins. This is why I believe we are just a few months away from the biggest cat season ever. And Simon\*\*‚Äô\*\*s Cat will be the leading coin of this meta for sure.

But here is the thing, $CAT is still extremely early considering the insane potential of this project.

Team behind $CAT is loaded and I really mean this. These guys are running massive paid marketing campaigns, and they are throwing down serious funds to get this thing out there and create something that will stay.

They already listed $CAT on the majority of the biggest exchanges in the world like OKX, [Gate.io](http://Gate.io), KuCoin or HTX.

But it's not just about the money, the team is super organized and working around the clock. You can tell they are not messing around. They are constantly bringing bullish news and when they promise something they always deliver it. And you can see it even on the chart because $CAT is sitting at 230M market cap

Thanks to this fact, the community members are helping with everything they can help with because they know $CAT is a once in a lifetime opportunity.

Honestly, don‚Äôt sleep on this. Projects like $CAT do not stay under billion for too long so it is just a matter of time until Binance lists $CAT and it will become one of the biggest memecoins ever.

I‚Äôm not telling you what to do, but if you are looking for something with huge upside potential but something not as risky as other memecoins, $CAT could be exactly what you have been waiting for.

Kendu - Lets Talk About the FUD,38,1fwz72e,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1fwz72e/kendu_lets_talk_about_the_fud/,26,"Actually, let's let the auditors do it for us. Anybody who has been interested by all the claims of positive metrics around Kendu but worried about the FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt) you come across calling it a scam, avoid the reddit comment section and just check out what auditors say about it. Links are all below.

To be clear, scams coins aren't around for as long as we have been, much less are they as active.  

Not sure if you can trust the audit links? Fine, then check whatever coin you deem reliable on that platform, and see what it spits back at you. 

With Kendu, everything but trading volume is up at the moment. Everything. When most whales sold, people bought the dip, pumping both the holder count and the coin. That's redistribution. That's healthy for any coin. The concerns with other AltCoins and memes like Shib are that whales control and manipulate the market. Whales do do that. That's not a problem with Kendu anymore (check the Etherscan link below). 

Now, I know trading volume is important. But, Kendu doesn't pay for growth, it grows organically. What's that mean? Well, think about what happened with GameStop stock on WSB a few years ago. A group got together to upheave and redefine the space by not playing by the rules. They hyped and pumped it up themselves. By refusing to ride the waves caused by whales. That's Kendu within crypto.  

Kendu does not pay for KOLs (Key Opinion Leader). What's a KOL? Those are the X and YouTube influencers pumping up some bs coin with an obnoxious name and even more ridiculous logo and slogan. Coins that stand for nothing, offer you nothing, and are built on a house of cards. When the dev (developer) and whales within those coins feel like they've scammed enough people in to buying in, they dump/rug pull. Or, when the KOL scams the Dev in to giving them a huge number of tokens for a post or a video, the KOL sells out to cash in, dumping the coin. That's what happens. 

We don't do that at Kendu. Why? Because we don't gamble, we work.

Also, IF we have any extra cash, we'd rather buy more Kendu with it, and spread by word of mouth/social media posts. Buying in to KOLs or bots is either a waste of money or a death sentence for your coin. 

To be clear, the memecoin space isn't for everyone. It's the wild west of the internet, of Crypto, and of DeFI. You need to have thick skin, diamond hands and balls of steel to survive here. It's volatile here and can't always be tracked with the same metrics used to game traditional markets. There's also A LOT of money to be made in this space by those with conviction .. and it's usually made off of the backs of those who sell at a loss. We call the latter Daniels at Kendu in memory of the guy who dropped his bags at 4M MC right before the ATH. 

Back to metrics, trading volume is a catch 22 though - if more people are holding (which holder count has never seen a negative week) then less people are trading. Growth is still outpacing selling, but it's organic. Organic is slow. Holders are shilling constantly (no, we're not bots) and shilling IRL (In Real Life). They're filming themselves, getting tattoos, and going viral. Kendu was trending number 1 on X just a few weeks back. 

All of this, and Kendu is only 7 months old. All the fudders like to point out how low Kendu is from ATH, but ignore the fact that Kendu reached ATH \~4 months in to launch, all organically. The growth was as slow before that until it wasn't, with a massive spike in engagement causing a launch to ATH within a 2 month window in early summer. However, when the crypto market drew back, Kendu moved with the market. We've been working diligently to regain that visibility since.  

Yes, Kendu released an NFT (Non Fungible Token) marketplace called Chads. Not interested in NFTs? That's fine. It is still worth noting that it resulted in the largest NFT mint of the last three years with 10K chads minted in \~2 months generating millions in IRL money that went right back in to Kendu. You'll notice I said marketplace and not just NFTs. While the Chads marketplace doesn't expect to overtake OpenSeas (valued at $13.3 billion currently), it's goal is to take conquer some of that space. Think of a tier 2 CEX (Coin Exchange) as compared to a Tier 1 like CoinBase. Also, anybody who bought one or some of the initial 10k Chad NFTs bought into ownership of the marketplace, generating income on fees collected from trading within the Chads Marketplace. 

Was Kendu scammed? No. Well, sort of. Somebody hacked in to the BitGet Telegram account and posed as a BitGet rep to collect $100K from Kendu in exchange for a listing. However, when BitGet got wind of this, not only did the CEO come in to a Live X Spaces with the community, but BitGet will be buying in to Kendu to the tune of $100k USD. Recently, a Robinhood funded account also bought $112k USD of Kendu. Finally, a few months ago CoinBase released an ad that featured Kendu front and center among several other top tier meme coins, stable coins, alt coins, and BTC. Kendu is the only meme coin shown in that ad that isn't actually listed on CoinBase .. yet. There may or may not be a conversation in the works. 

Weirdly enough, somebody also hacked in to the official United Nations X account and tried to get money from the dev. He said he'd pay if they'd post from official account, and so there's several screen shots somewhere of an official United Nations X account posting that Kendu is Lord. To be clear, Dev knew it was another hack, and it got reported shortly after.  

Look, I'm not trying to convince you to buy in. But, in the entire 7 month life span of Kendu (yes, that's all), we've made a lot of waves. Think back to all the other coins you've seen pumped and gone in that time (can you even name 3). All the other older meme coins you wished you would moon but seemed manipulated but whales. 

That's not us. Never has been. Never will be. We're too distributed. We're the little guys fighting our way to the top. Call us degenerates, a cult, unhinged. A band of cucks and a crew of jeets. We're invested in memecoins, we obviously love the pain. Just don't call us a fucking scam and DYOR instead.

At Kendu Inu, we don't gamble. We fuckin work. 

If another meme coin looks more attractive right now and is pumping, buy in. Just remember, you might be buying at their top. Right now, with a coin that's gained this much notoriety, you know that Kendu has not only found it's floor, but tested to make sure it's solid enough to launch from. 

So buy in or don't and happy bull run to all.      

*You should always DYOR (Do Your Own Research) and treat anything you read online (including this) as NFA (Not Financial Advice).*

EigenLayer A Decentralized Restaking Protocol,2,1fw4kn7,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1fw4kn7/eigenlayer_a_decentralized_restaking_protocol/,10,"  
EigenLayer is a novel protocol designed to enhance the utility of staked Ethereum (ETH) by enabling its rehypothecation. In essence, it allows ETH stakers to delegate their enforcement rights to EigenLayer, empowering the protocol to restake this ETH on other applications. This process, known as rehypothecation, doesn't require the original staker to relinquish control over their ETH.

**Key Features and Benefits:**

* **Enhanced ETH Utility:** EigenLayer expands the potential use cases for staked ETH beyond the traditional staking rewards.
* **Increased Security:** By leveraging the collective security of the EigenLayer network, rehypothecated ETH benefits from enhanced protection against attacks.
* **Enhanced DeFi Ecosystem:** EigenLayer can fuel the growth of the DeFi ecosystem by providing a secure and efficient mechanism for collateralizing various financial instruments.
* **Innovation Catalyst:** The protocol's flexibility can spur the development of innovative applications that leverage the security and value of staked ETH.

**How It Works:**

1. **Staking:** Users stake their ETH on the Ethereum blockchain as usual.
2. **Rehypothecation:** Stakers grant EigenLayer additional enforcement rights over their staked ETH.
3. **Restaking:** EigenLayer uses these rights to restake the ETH on other applications, such as DeFi protocols or other staking derivatives.
4. **Rewards:** Stakers receive a portion of the rewards generated from the rehypothecated ETH, along with their original staking rewards.

**Potential Use Cases:**

* **Decentralized Finance (DeFi):** EigenLayer can be used to create new DeFi products, such as lending platforms, derivatives, and insurance protocols, that leverage the security and value of staked ETH.
* **Web3 Applications:** It can enable the development of innovative Web3 applications that require a high level of security and trust.
* **Enterprise Applications:** EigenLayer can be used to create enterprise solutions that benefit from the decentralized nature of the Ethereum blockchain.

  
  
the protocol has the potential to enhance security, and expand the utility of staked ETH across various applications. you can Join [**Candybomb event**](https://www.bitget.com/events/candy-bomb) Deposit and trade EIGEN to get EIGEN airdrop on the cex!

Some huge news are coming this month and you definitely do not want to miss this.

$CAT might look like a basic cat coin but opposite is the truth. The team behind $CAT is experienced, rich and know exactly what to do and how to do it to make this project really reach billions.

The community is absolutely insane. With nearly 230k holders, 80k Telegram members and insane 200k X followers. It is just a matter of time until we reach billions.

$CAT is on the BNB blockchain. This means there is a high of possibility of it getting listed on Binance soon. After all, $CAT is sitting at 230M market cap so it is more than ready to get listed there.

What is also important to mention about $CAT is that

* $25 million worth of supply was already burned
* $CAT is listed on a majority of the biggest exchanges such as HTX, Kucoin or [Gate.io](http://Gate.io)
* $CAT is also partnered with FLOKI, one of the biggest coins ever
* The art and meme itself is also known worldwide and therefore many more people will get in

$CAT will do something we have never seen before. I truly believe it can become the biggest meme project in the whole world and this is your chance to be still extremely early considering the upside potential.

Do not miss your chance to change your life with $CAT on BNB

Unio Coin (UNIO) has emerged as a notable player in the blockchain-based gaming platform with unique blend of wide-scale interoperability, robust support for user-generated content, and a clear economic model that could potentially set a new standard for blockchain gaming platforms. While other platforms excel in specific areas, Unio's holistic ecosystem approach might offer a more cohesive and engaging user experience and encourages a broader adoption of blockchain technology. 

The introduction of NFTs and a governance token gives players full ownership of their digital assets and participation in the platform's governance. The governance token $UNIO recently got listed on many top exchanges including Bitget, gateio, mexc and kucoin with Poolx and Candybomb campaigns still on Bitget.

A New Era of Gaming Ownership,1,1fuaxuv,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1fuaxuv/a_new_era_of_gaming_ownership/,6,"As a gaming enthusiast, I've always been frustrated by the lack of ownership and control over in-game assets, a common limitation with traditional gaming platforms.

EigenLayer: A Leading Restaking Protocol Empowering Ethereum's Ecosystem,1,1fsxaz4,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1fsxaz4/eigenlayer_a_leading_restaking_protocol/,4,"
EigenLayer is a pioneering restaking protocol built on Ethereum through a series of smart contracts, allowing ETH native stakers to opt in and validate new software modules designed to enhance the Ethereum ecosystem. Since its inception in 2021, EigenLayer has grown significantly, achieving over $15 billion in total value locked (TVL), making it a key player in decentralized finance. The platform‚Äôs native token, $EIGEN, is set to launch on May 10, marking a significant step in its development.

In terms of financial backing, EigenLayer has raised more than $64.5 million from leading venture funds like Coinbase Ventures and Polychain Capital. Additionally, the project has formed strategic partnerships with prominent tech foundations such as the Near Foundation, Polyhedra Network, and CELO Foundation. According to DeFiLlama, EigenLayer has become the third-largest DeFi protocol by TVL, trailing only Lido and Aave. The platform enables users to re-stake their Ether or liquid staking tokens (LSTs), allowing them to earn additional yield by securing third-party applications known as Actively Validated Services (AVS).

EigenLayer's tokenomics reflect a strong focus on community growth and long-term sustainability. Of the total 1.67 billion EIGEN token supply, 45% is allocated to community initiatives, 29.5% to investors, and 25.5% to contributors. The allocations for investors and contributors will vest linearly over two years following a one-year cliff. Additionally, 15% of the total EIGEN supply is reserved for airdrops, with 5% available for claim on May 10. Importantly, only direct restakers and users who participate through Liquid Restaking Tokens (LRTs) such as EtherFi‚Äôs eETH and Renzo‚Äôs ezETH are eligible for this initial claim.

Restaking is a core feature of EigenLayer, allowing stakers to restake their native ETH or LSTs to secure the ecosystem‚Äôs services, known as Actively Validated Services (AVS). Operators within EigenLayer are entities that register and run AVS software, allowing stakers to delegate their stakes to them. Stakers can either delegate their staked ETH to operators or choose to run validation services themselves, becoming operators. This double opt-in process ensures that both the operator and the staker agree to the arrangement, with restakers retaining full control over their stakes and deciding which AVS they wish to validate. AVSs are built on EigenLayer‚Äôs protocol and leverage Ethereum‚Äôs shared security to deliver services to users and the broader Web3 ecosystem, with operators playing a crucial role in maintaining network security and integrity.

As an exciting development, the $EIGEN token will be listed on Bitget starting October 1, once liquidity requirements are met. This marks a significant milestone for EigenLayer, opening up new opportunities for participants and further expanding its influence within the Ethereum ecosystem.

The game is further elevated by renowned voice actors from famous anime and original songs for each of the 36 characters, performed by these voice actors and popular artists. All the music is available through the prestigious avex trax label.

At the heart of the game's economy is $GEEK, the main governance token. With a total supply of 2 billion tokens, $GEEK provides liquidity and serves as the foundation for in-game activities. In addition to $GEEK, the game features xGEEK, an off-chain stablecoin that allows players to enjoy a seamless free-to-play experience. Players can earn xGEEK through in-game actions, which can later be exchanged for $GEEK, adding further value to the in-game economy.

The game also boasts a dual NFT asset system that includes NFT dolls and NFT equipment, both of which are essential for battles and character enhancements. These NFTs, which come in the form of weapons, armor, and accessories, can be acquired using $GEEK, offering real utility and value to token holders. Players can also earn $GEEK through various in-game activities such as PvP challenges, Guild vs Guild matches, and exploring land dungeons. Additionally, players can discover GEEK boxes and rare NFT assets through the game's build mode.

Now listed on the Bitget exchange, $GEEK is gaining attention for its strong fundamentals and growing play-to-earn economy. To celebrate this, Bitget is hosting a Candybomb event where participants can earn a share of a 3,333,333 $GEEK reward pool.

With the introduction of the first and only confidential EVM in production (Sapphire) and its cross-chain application ( OPL - Oasis Privacy Layer), Oasis started a new trend of hackathons - a focus on privacy-enabled projects. The¬†[Privacy4Web3 (P4W3) hackathon's first edition](https://oasisprotocol.org/blog/oasis-announces-hackathon-winners)¬†ran Jul 19 ‚Äì Oct 4, 2023, and attracted over 1.1k participants vying for the glory. Cut to 2024, where a successful brand refresh has established Oasis as a pioneer of smart privacy for web3 and AI. So, it is logical the¬†[P4W3 hackathon 2.0](https://oasisprotocol.org/hackathon)¬†would be bigger and better. Let's see how.

During this year, Oasis strengthened its DeCC (decentralized confidential computation) capabilities by adding¬†[DeAI](https://oasisprotocol.org/decentralized-ai)¬†(decentralized AI) solutions. It now offers the combining power of on-chain confidentiality (TEEs that work well in sync with ZKP, FHE, sMPC, etc) and off-chain verifiability (ROFL framework - Runtime OFf-chain Logic). The¬†[registrations for the hackathon](https://dorahacks.io/hackathon/p4w3/)¬†are already open and the BUIDL deadline is Nov 11, 2024. All privacy enthusiasts are welcome to join the annual event which is online and on-chain anywhere in the world.

Announced during the recently concluded Token2049 in Singapore, Oasis is the main sponsor of the P4W3 hackathon 2.0 with Ocean Protocol as the co-sponsor. Five others - Aethir, Apillon, Dedaub, PixelRealm, and Zero1 Labs - have also joined hands to make this edition of the hackathon one of the largest in terms of bounties, scope, and impact for developing next-gen projects not only with Oasis Sapphire but also across all EVM networks.

There is no limit to brainstorming for ideas when it comes to creativity with on-chain confidentiality being the key factor. Some of the projects that would expectedly line up as hackathon entries would be in these fields:

* **DeFi**¬†- the perennial favorite. Participants can consider building privacy-preserving dApps around dark pools, Dutch auctions, cross-chain swaps, etc.
* **NFTs**¬†- while NFTs have been there for a long time, confidential NFTs are still waiting to gain ground. Tools for data privacy for NFTs and related off-chain data would be worth developing.
* **Gaming**¬†- blockchain games are garnering quite some attention these days. Building trustless, hidden fog-of-war mechanics, breaking the link between in-game profiles and on-chain accounts, and exploring the agent-gaming design space could be game-changing.
* **Trustless oracles**¬†- possibilities abound now more than before. The ROFL framework could be ideal for ensuring verifiable and confidential off-chain computation governed by policies stored on-chain.
* [AI agents](https://oasisprotocol.org/blog/agents-the-future-of-onchain-ux)¬†- future of on-chain UX in the making. Participants can consider building storage for agent private keys on-chain, verify off-chain agent workloads,¬†etc.

Exciting BUIDL times ahead, right? Stay tuned as the next part of the series will share more details you need to know to make your mark in the Privacy4Web3 hackathon 2.0. In the meantime, here is the¬†[welcome session](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AXIsElPZA0)¬†from the sponsors, the first of many. Let's do this!

On top of that, they have ensured ethereum compatibility, meaning users can keep using tools and wallets they are used to.  And projects can easily migrate.

Also a private/hybrid/public design.

With the ability to code in any language, this will be an easy choice for business to engage in blockchain solutions.  They can start testing a privatenet- for next to nothing - just like the community devs did.  And the hybrid option will really open up use cases for enterprise. 

I think all this combined will create an ecosystem that the old coins have not been able to achieve.

Why I believe 8-Bit Coin will be the biggest GameFi project this year,6,1fleqpd,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1fleqpd/why_i_believe_8bit_coin_will_be_the_biggest/,4,"I really like GameFi and when I find a really good project like $COIN I just can not help myself and have to find everything about the token.

This coin project was created to level up game development on the Solana network. The goal is to on-board the next wave of web2 gamers into web3

What is interesting about this coin is its connection with Bonk. $COIN has 3 liquidity pools. SOL, USDC and Bonk. The reason for this is very simple. If you dig into all the wallets you will find out that some of the team members are huge Bonk whales with millions in $BONK.

The Dexscreener page might seem weird but this is only because $COIN is still in early stage when team members are setting everything up and preparing their project for this bullrun.

And even though they have not started with marketing yet you can see that the chart looks insane and this project will go to places.

If you want to find out more about this gem, join our Telegram and we will answer any questions you have.

‚ÄúWe have created $COIN in 2024 with one simple goal, to render it as the most valuable gaming-focused memecoin asset‚Äù. -Team

The Rise of $CATE: The Next Meme Revolution on the Ethereum Blockchain,2,1fl7wtp,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1fl7wtp/the_rise_of_cate_the_next_meme_revolution_on_the/,2,"
For over a decade, $DOGE has been at the forefront of the meme revolution, capturing the hearts of millions. But now, a new star is on the rise: $CATE. It's time to embrace the future, as $CATE steps into the spotlight, ready to become the largest and most vibrant community on the Ethereum blockchain. Are you ready to join the movement?

Let‚Äôs introduce you to the legendary CATE, the pioneering pet of Atsuko Sato fondly known as ""Kabosu Mama."" You may already know Kabosu, the Shiba Inu who became the face of the iconic Doge meme, but before the world fell in love with her, there was CATE. This trailblazing feline has always been a key part of the Sato household and is now ready to make its mark in the crypto space.

CATE isn‚Äôt just any cat. As the best friend of $DOGE, this legendary meme feline has stood by its side and now extends a paw of friendship to $NEIRO. With an adventurous spirit and irresistible charm, CATE has leaped onto the Ethereum blockchain, ready to leave its mark on crypto history. Can you feel the excitement?

And here‚Äôs the best part: $CATE is now officially listed on Bitget Exchange! To celebrate this huge milestone, Bitget is hosting a Candybomb event. This is your chance to get in on the action and claim your share of 1,920,000 $CATE. Don‚Äôt miss out on this opportunity and be a part of the $CATE revolution today!

An Unorthodox Wanted Ad,17,1fku2wt,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1fku2wt/an_unorthodox_wanted_ad/,11,"This post is exactly what it says as the Wanted Ad is not traditional, BUT it is surely in the right subreddits. It may not be an ad for some people, but I do think my epiphany applies to humans, especially those seeking self improvement. This is especially true if you desire something bigger for your social media footprint.

Overall, to help others improve I would strongly encourage people to find passion/motivation and find a community to support you and lift you up. There is nothing unorthodox about this suggestion. In order to be transparent I want to share that I found both in the most unlikely place and hearing others say how this community has changed the trajectory of their lives for three and a half months now encouraged me to make this post and find the right subreddit to share it. (post was originally for a different audience though wasn‚Äôt sure if that was allowed and never heard back from mods)

\*Full Disclosure:\* I have a full time career that I really do love and enjoy. I think I am making a difference in the world and to me that is crucial, BUT this isn‚Äôt the community that I am talking about.¬†

The place that I am suggesting is a memecoin crypto currency community that is organically built and filled with real people from all around the world. If I still have your attention I am going to dig into my why of the Kendu Community and how this could be a path for many people to work on improving their own lives and better themselves in ways they likely would not have imagined. Overall, I am not even suggesting for the main body of this post that you need to buy Kendu and become a holder. You could join the community and work alongside others to help with brand awareness and be lauded as a Legend and a real Chad or Chadette in the community. Buying in does give that extra motivation and inspiration as the idea of working for one‚Äôs bag is something big in this crypto project. Being this post is for memecoin/crypto subs, seems a bit silly to suggest not having a bag, but one must do their own actual research and reading.¬†

There is still a wealth of resources available to learn about Kendu, so you don‚Äôt get duped when you hear some one month old account say that Miazaki got scammed twice or you hear that he is going to make a cat coin (yes the recent Spaces are not recorded anymore, but you can join one and step up and ask the questions yourself. Miazaki welcomes new speakers) or you read that same one month old account say that he is going to use Chads funds for naughty things (he did say this and he did not mean it, but the uninitiated would be easily duped).

# **Direction and Drive**

Thinking about the fun and the testimonials from members really motivated me to make this post. People in the Telegram are all moving in the same direction. The goal is to promote and grow the brand into an international success story like SHIB and DOGE have done in the past for Crypto. People are all invested (I said you don‚Äôt even have to buy in, but naturally changing their financial standing is what has motivated everyone. Everyone must have goals and being invested creates its own inherent goal for each individual and goals are crucial to self improvement) and the shared vision makes it really easy to rally around the work that is done.¬†

For me I have willingly written multiple Reddit articles, made my first memes, spearheaded¬† work with StockTwits to grow our presence on that platform and make sure the platform actually worked for us, I have even done massive bike rides (I am much healthier for this aspect of my Kendu ‚Äòwork‚Äô) around a major city and my local area to place stickers to raise brand awareness,¬† andI have¬† even taken my X account from a single account I followed for crypto TA to one that I use for Kendu extensively (blue check mark soon). I haven‚Äôt felt this passionate about something in a long long time.

Here are a couple testimonials that really support the realization I had about this community and how it can help the right person to improve themself while channeling their passions and having fun.

[This Chad joined just a bit before I did, but his impact on the community has been monumental. He is a representation of what is really awesome about humanity in so many ways!](https://preview.redd.it/0s9ye7jzqtpd1.jpg?width=1189&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=69036f45bdeffb5279f6f5a6b85fcd8e17f5a294)



https://preview.redd.it/ww6g6zpxqtpd1.jpg?width=1189&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8576ba91f91866927b428d2ad4bac24ff7963c57

I listened to a number of members come up on the X Spaces and talk about what life was like before Kendu for them and it is fascinating the impact that Kendu has had on so many people. The Developer during X Spaces even encourages new faces to come up and speak ALL THE TIME. He really wants this to happen and it is a tremendously empowering thing to overcome a fear and get up on an X Space (no one can see your face which is really nice for many) and then come back to the Telegram to members complimenting you for overcoming your fear or how well you sounded. This is a place of acceptance and one that provides plenty of opportunities for us to put ourselves in situations to be a little uncomfortable

u/GoodWillShills on X said the other day (Kendu Loyalist and a really great human): 

[CT \(crypto twitter\) is the worst tbhIts going to turn normies to look for a community that they can be accepted in‚Ä¶](https://preview.redd.it/ds8lqxjvqtpd1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=14846b9387116258fda776b1a9675aa0fcc85a0e)

# **Leverage your Passions to Grow the Brand**

¬†Kendu is an original IP,¬† but the developer, Kendu Miazaki, doesn't care what you do with the brand. He doesn't own it and if¬† you want to put KENDU in your video game, make merch, start an energy drink, whatever the community has the freedom to do so. Just don‚Äôt double dip. For example There are Kendu shirts on the Merch store and on Amazon now. Clothing is set, but maybe you can make a line of Kendu shoes cause that is your passion. You already have a built in clientele for your product and the community WILL support you!

[Being shipped now and ready for regular ordering I believe](https://preview.redd.it/cnyuirgsqtpd1.png?width=810&format=png&auto=webp&s=ffcaea26d8e578d17e4ee4b33bb7b52b20bda7b8)

People have the freedom to do what they want and it is empowering to leverage your own passion with the common goal of growing the brand which in turn can help change one‚Äôs financial status. A community member started the merch store around 1 million market cap and Miazaki has spoken publicly that he doesn‚Äôt have time for that and is happy for others to be leaders.

One member is a jewelry maker and he¬† has created (I think it is almost completely done) a Kendu pendant template. Which he can sell to pay for his hard work. Maybe he will take the profits and put it back into the chart or not, but that doesn‚Äôt matter. If you have a great product you want to take to market and you want to use the Kendu brand and are an active member of the community (this is the key, don‚Äôt join the telegram and start pitching ideas or your product as it will go really poorly for you) you will have the support of over 10K TG members and over 14K holders.¬†

https://preview.redd.it/6xgnpopqqtpd1.jpg?width=1189&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bcf8adbcac894dec4ca53f4d044743e6a6384dc7

If you really want to grow a YouTube or Tik Tok presence you could easily do so with the support of a strong community thru Kendu content. Take a look at my account. It is saturated with Kendu content mainly and my Karma has grown exponentially because I am as active as I can be. I went from like 5K karma to almost 30K karma now. I will assure you I do not care about that stuff, but it was a nice surprise and one I never thought about.

# **Fun**

This whole idea started because my kids were back to school and I was back to work and things were crazy busy. My body was low on sleep and energy and yet I couldn't resist the pull to jump into the Kendu Telegram to check in and do at least one post. I had an absolute blast in the TG that night. There are a wealth of personalities that exist. We have members from all over the world including: Australia, Denmark, England, Ireland, Germany, Thailand, India, USA (all over), Ghana, Brazil, and Netherlands to name a few. At this point the Telegram has even grown various sub groups with varying interests. Much of the Telegram is hyper focused on sharing to socials and shilling Kendu, but there are certain periods in the course of a day where more hanging out and off topic conversations can and do happen (limited, but true). Another aspect of fun that will inevitably happen is deeper connections are formed¬† as you are shilling, leveraging your passions. This gives room for side conversations with individuals that you have grown stronger bonds with. While the main Telegram is for work and spreading the brand you will be able to grow strong relationships and connections with others. What is life without human interaction and friendship? Some of my favorite moments are when I am in the Telegram and someone joins who clearly considers themselves an influencer or KOL and said person is looking for Kendu to pay them for promotion services. This is NOT what we do and we do not take kindly to such requests. Watching the community pile onto that person, who clearly did not research about the Kendu whey, is hilarious. YouTube raids are a great joy too and I have really been impressed with the community showing on various crypto focused X Spaces.

\*Background on the Coin:\* Currently there are 10497 members in the TG to support and encourage your growth of the brand. The community has grown organically without paying for KOLs, influencers or any fake upvotes or increases in traffic (it is a seedy world and it does happen for sure in Crypto, def other places too). We have members on all socials/Platforms (Reddit, X, TikTok (need growth), Instagram (need growth), YouTube, and StockTwits. Kendu is an original IP and is the developers last project ever.¬† If you want to learn more you can find the official Kendu reddit page in my profile (Not breaking the rules cause I can and do read).

If you see this as a path forward to self improvement for you, I encourage you to join the Telegram and lurk for a bit. If admin/Loyalist asks that you prove you are not a bot (bots join all the time and the filters will kick you out/ban you), then just politely tell them you are going to lurk for a bit to learn about the culture and community. I encourage all to lurk and learn about the community and decide what you can do. It has been a blast and has positively impacted so many people‚Äôs lives in meaningful ways.

Here are the most interesting details:


**Liquidity Boost & Stakeholder Commitment**: Ctrl Wallet is launching a 12-month liquidity provision program for its $XDEFI token, with major holders (including Delphi Digital, Mechanism Capital, and others) committing 32% of the total $XDEFI supply to Uniswap pools. This shows long-term confidence in the project while deepening liquidity and reducing selling pressure.



**Tokenomics Overhaul**: The project is introducing a new token unlocking schedule tied to performance milestones, starting in March 2025. Tokens will unlock at different stages of the $XDEFI token reaching $100M, $200M, $300M, and $500M fully diluted valuations.



**Incentivized Liquidity**: Investors locking their tokens in AMM pools will earn a 10% APY on their deposits, but the treasury‚Äôs tokens are excluded from this benefit, aligning rewards with external contributors.

Well toad, rabbit, cock, bull etc all tried but Cats and Dogs meme remain top community. The love for this two can be traced to the pioneering pet of Atsuko Sato (Cat and Dog), the dogs inspired Shiba inu and doge. Now, the Cats meme communities are pushing for the exposure of ‚ÄúCate‚Äù known as the Kabosu Mama. They believe that CATE isn't just any cat but a legendary meme feline that has been the best friend to the famous $DOGE and now extends a paw of friendship to $NEIRO.

Currently, $CATE is trending after many top exchanges listed and many more like Bitget have scheduled it listing for 16th. I wonder if this might be the next doge or shiba but considering its tokenomic and total supply I think is worthy to add to watchlist. Also considering this is related to the Sato family will it become the top cat community meme?

I have been diving into the crypto world and stumbled upon something truly fascinating about $BTW. It's pretty wild to see how rare it is for projects to achieve and maintain a $1M market cap. To put it into perspective, only about 0.000001% of projects hit that mark and even fewer manage to stay there long term.

Well, $BTW is one of those rare exceptions. This coin not only reached a $1M market cap but soared to nearly $20M shortly after launch. While it has since settled around $1,5M, its managed to hold its ground thanks to some major whale support.

What sets $BTW apart isn't just its market performance but also its incredible community and innovative marketing strategies. In the crowded crypto space, organic social media marketing is crucial. We have seen how PONKE blew up with its unique animations. The $BTW team gets this, and they‚Äôve taken it a step further.

Instead of sticking to the usual animated content, they have been creating real life, eye-catching content. For example, they went skydiving in banana costumes and even had their CTO tape himself in a banana suit to a van, which was driven around NYC for hours. These stunts are not only memorable but also help $BTW stand out in a saturated market.

As a decentralized platform known for its scalability and speed, TON offers the ideal environment for Hamster Kombat to thrive.

# Leveraging TON's Power for a Seamless Gaming Experience

* **Scalability:** TON's architecture ensures that Hamster Kombat can handle a large number of players and transactions without compromising performance. This means smooth gameplay, even during peak hours.
* **Speed:** The network's fast transaction times translate to near-instantaneous responses within the game, enhancing the overall user experience.

Hamster Kombat's cryptocurrency-based economy aligns perfectly with TON's decentralized philosophy. Players can earn and spend tokens within the game, creating a vibrant ecosystem that drives engagement and growth. These tokens can be used for:

* **Acquiring new hamsters** with unique abilities and attributes.
* **Upgrading existing hamsters** to enhance their performance.
* **Participating in special events** and tournaments.
* **Trading with other players** on the TON Network marketplace

Anyway, we anticipate a good listing price to calm the community. I hate to fud but we expected more from Catizen team especially with the Binance involvement even when I am still skeptical with the new listing procedure on the exchange.

Anyway, all hopes ain‚Äôt lost we can still take advantages of exchange free airdrops campaign to earn more or stake your $cati on Bitget to earn up to 140,000,000% APR from the $bgb rewardd pool. That might help to recover money spend farming project.

&#x200B;

A VC partnership, interest from the world's biggest exchanges (*Upbit, Gate.io, BitVavo*), a full-out marketing campaign, and NFTs with actual utilities launching on September 19th... 

&#x200B;

**It's great to be a $HEGE holder, and you are not too late to become one!** 

&#x200B;

With the rise of meme coins and community driven tokens, it‚Äôs clear that Hege is playing into the trend, *but with a slightly more structured and narrative-driven spin than most - with all due respect to most!*

&#x200B;

# VC-backing:

&#x200B;

**Victus Capital, a leading venture capital firm specializing in the crypto sector, is investing between $300K and $500K into our project!**

&#x200B;

[$HEGE's first VC partnership.](https://preview.redd.it/csie04ceseod1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=64c9752049d6b7e4107c2053afe457aa421835c3)

 

***This is our first of many VC partnerships!***

&#x200B;

*This isn‚Äôt just about the funding*; it‚Äôs a strong endorsement from a firm that‚Äôs collaborated with top-tier exchanges, crypto-friendly businesses, and has an impactful marketing strategy.  


[ Victus Capital's extensive network of connections. ](https://preview.redd.it/kjp6aiegseod1.jpg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a1a843350c2ed2aa45719e45b6c00bbf8b48445d)

&#x200B;

**Victus Capital‚Äôs support is only the beginning, as this partnership will only open the doors to more partnerships, deals and opportunities for the project!**  


&#x200B;

# Two new partnerships:  

* **IceCreamSwap -** This is a DEX using the Neon EVM which allows developers to build and deploy Ethereum-native apps on Solana. The Neon team reached out to us to join in a partnership to bridge our token to the Neon chain. This will allow our token to be traded and used on the Neon chain. ***This partnership is free for $HEGE, but will bring us added visibility from not only announcements and tweets by Neon Labs and Ice Cream Swap, but by being available for use on their chain.***

&#x200B;

* **Wing Swap -** Several weeks ago, we were on an AMA with Wing Swap ***(this was the one who's project's co-founder was the saxophonist for Pink Floyd)***. They really liked our project, we really liked them and are now entering into a larger partnership. The opportunities are endless, but **over the next few weeks, the Wing Swap application will be released and will allow $HEGE to be purchased directly using credit cards or bank debit for United States, Australia, and New Zealand citizens.** This will allow normies in these countries to very easily purchase $HEGE without going through CEXs or DEXs. This will be huge, especially for Americans who do not have access to the CEXs that we are listed on. They will now a very easy way to acquire $HEGE!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# The 5th largest centralized exchange (CEX) in the world has just reached out to $HEGE!

&#x200B;

[Upbit has expressed interest in $HEGE!](https://preview.redd.it/561k3zaiseod1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a4ef0802f64e59287e2ab08e26de204cde69d881)

&#x200B;

**General info regarding the Upbit exchange:**

&#x200B;

* Daily volume: **$1,221,289,372.20**
* Active users**: 9 million**
* **$HEGE forecast: BULLISH!**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Besides Upbit, 

**Gate.io (the 7th largest CEX globally) and Bitvavo have both shown interest in our project and informed us that we‚Äôre on their watchlist.**

If we keep progressing as we are, we could be listed on both exchanges in the near future. This would expose $HEGE to a huge number of new users and could bring the project to new heights.

&#x200B;

**What this means?**

$HEGE would be available to 12 million new users on the [Gate.io](https://Gate.io) exchange, and about 1.5 million new users on the BitVavo exchange.

&#x200B;

[Gate.io](https://Gate.io) has a **$1,229,041,018.61** daily volume, while BitVavo stands at **$166,969,712.28.**

&#x200B;

***Imagine even a small percent of that coming into the $HEGE-fund!***

From VC backing and revolutionary NFTs with an actual utility, to a full-out marketing campaign, $HEGE has a lot in store. Let‚Äôs dive right in into the exciting news and upcoming events!

**If you‚Äôre unfamiliar with $HEGE, let me give you a quick introduction:**

*Hege is a meme coin on the Solana network and the first project to take a storytelling approach to cryptocurrency.* Our concept centers around our boy Hege, a hedgehog on a quest to win the heart of his dream girl, Hegena. We use this unique and relatable narrative to connect with our community, and as we hit certain market cap milestones, we unlock new chapters of the story! But Hege isn‚Äôt just about price speculation or quick profits. *We‚Äôre building a fun and interactive project‚Äîa place where holders can truly engage and be part of a healthy and supportive community.* We‚Äôre often called bots, which says a lot about our dedication: people can‚Äôt believe how hardworking and devoted we are. And this is just the beginning of what we can achieve!

**With the rise of meme coins and community driven tokens, it‚Äôs clear that Hege is playing into the trend, but with a slightly more structured and narrative-driven spin than most - with all due respect to most!**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# Revolutionary NFTs:

![img](hg3n29x2w8od1 "" 2,222 uniquely generated Hegends on the Solana network.
Drawn by hand and assembled by code, no two Hegends are the same. "")

&#x200B;

**A HegeCoin NFT collection** was planned and teased at the inception of the HegeCoin project in early April. According to plan, the NFT would be released once the $10 million market cap was surpassed. Having reached that milestone, we are pleased to introduce the widely anticipated Hegends NFT collection.

[\\""HEGENDS\\"" - The official NFT collection of $HEGE coin.](https://reddit.com/link/1fel81a/video/97o9ay94w8od1/player)

&#x200B;

There are 2 NFT sets, the whitelist set and the main set. The whitelist set was distributed to HegeCoin donors (‚ÄúFriends of Hege‚Äù members) and will entitle holders to mint a number of main set NFTs depending on donor tier. Additional whitelist spots were available to claim by the public/non-donors. *The main set will consist of 2,222 unique NFTs with traits of varying rarity.* While there will be future benefits of holding the whitelist NFT, this document will focus on the main set.

**With a total of 2,222 NFTs available, they will be distributed amongst the following groups:**

&#x200B;

* 600 for whitelist members
* 100 for influencers
* 600 maximum for project treasury
* 922 for main sale

The project treasury will be kept by the project for distribution as rewards for community members or for marketing purposes in the future. *No more than 90 NFTs from the project treasury will be released per quarter.*

**Whitelisting will be facilitated through the HEGE official discord.** Those on the whitelist are encouraged to review/communicate there for minting details. If whitelist positions are still available, they can be claimed by going to the whitelist channel and requesting a position on the list.

**14 Guardians of Hege are responsible for contributing greater than $250k in project donations. Their donations have made the HegeCoin project possible. For their contributions, Guardians will receive an NFT with a 1-1 trait, to commemorate their commitment to HegeCoin.**

&#x200B;

**Utility**

**Holders of the NFT will be entitled to certain benefits.** While more benefits will be announced in the future, a benefit we would like to announce immediately is the Hege dividend.

When an NFT is initially minted, a certain percentage of the purchase (see NFT Proceeds section for breakdown) is deposited into an NFT bank. This NFT bank will be used to purchase $HEGE. **Every month, 2% of Hege tokens in the bank will be distributed amongst NFT holders.** Each NFT held will entitle a holder to the same distribution from the bank (and if a holder has 10 NFTs, they will get 10X the distribution versus a holder who has 1 NFT). This will have 2 major benefits:

&#x200B;

* *This provides a floor price for the NFT.* The more valuable the $HEGE token becomes, the more valuable the NFT becomes due to the increased dividend distribution.
* *Provides an initial boost to the $HEGE price.* Since the funds in the NFT bank will be used to purchase $HEGE, this will provide a nice boost to the token.

**Additionally, when an NFT is bought or sold in the future (when it changes wallets), there will be a transaction tax. 4% of the total sale amount will be deposited into the NFT bank, used to purchase $HEGE, and thus increase the future dividend amount.**

NFTs listed for sale on the distribution date will not be eligible for the distribution. *Also, the wallet holding the NFT must also hold a minimum of 100 HEGE tokens. The holding requirement is primarily in place to prevent the need to create a token account for the wallet, which would increase fees and potentially minimize the overall distribution value.*

NFTs will be categorized in 5 standard rarity tiers: Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, and Legendary. The dividend payment will vary based on the tier with the rarest tier having the highest dividend payment. Below is a breakdown of the tiers with the dividend payments:

[Detailed explanation.](https://preview.redd.it/itywzap7w8od1.png?width=790&format=png&auto=webp&s=bdeabab19d10c84d33340b25b846eb3a6514b1a4)

&#x200B;

**NFT Proceeds**

NFT Proceeds come from two areas, the initial minting of the NFT, and future buys and sells of the NFT. When an NFT is originally minted, there will be a minting cost.

The proceeds of this will be distributed accordingly:

15% of the proceeds will be deposited into the NFT bank, 10% of the proceeds will be set aside to develop future utility for the NFT, and 75% of the proceeds will be used for HegeCoin project expenses including, but not limited to operations and marketing costs. As mentioned above, the NFT Bank will be used to pay NFT holders a 2% monthly dividend.

**Royalties**

When an NFT is purchased or sold, there will be a 8% royalty on the overall transaction. Of that 50% will go into the project wallet and 50% will go into the NFT bank.

[The NFT Collection - How it works.](https://preview.redd.it/8mmoat89w8od1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=052befecbc2bd8b98121db40edcf644fbad1f330)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Besides NFT launch we‚Äôre expecting on the September 19th (presale September 17th), **Gate.io (the 7th largest CEX globally) and Bitvavo have both shown interest in our project and informed us that we‚Äôre on their watchlist.** If we keep progressing as we are, we could be listed on both exchanges in the near future.

# 

&#x200B;

# The Social Media Tool:

**The latest social media tool is showing great potential!** It developed over 40 videos that effectively promote $HEGE, *tailored to perform well with different short form social media algorithms* (TikTok, Instagram reels ,Youtube shorts). Each video comes with more than 100 unique variations, and as a result, every video will appear completely original to social media algorithms!

Hamster Kombat Gears Up for $HMSTR Token Launch and Airdrop,1,1fejemw,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1fejemw/hamster_kombat_gears_up_for_hmstr_token_launch/,1,"Hamster Kombat has built a lot of excitement in the Telegram gaming community, with players looking forward to the launch of its $HMSTR token. After months of speculation, there‚Äôs a sense that the token could change the way players earn rewards and interact with the game. Expectations are high, and many believe the $HMSTR token will not only improve the player experience but also attract more users, solidifying Hamster Kombat as a key player in the tap-to-earn space.  
  
On September 26, 2024, the long-awaited airdrop will finally happen. A significant 60% of the $HMSTR tokens will be given to active players as a reward for their engagement, while the remaining 40% will be used to ensure liquidity, build partnerships, and support the game's growth. This approach is designed to reward early supporters while also welcoming new players into the ecosystem.  
  
Adding to the excitement, Hamster Kombat just announced that the $HMSTR token will also be listed on Bitget just like OKX and bybit. To celebrate, Bitget is running a giveaway where participants can complete GLEAM tasks for a chance to win rewards. The promotion is live now and will run until September 25, 2024.  
  
As the launch date approaches, the anticipation continues to grow. The $HMSTR token is expected to bring big opportunities for Hamster Kombat, setting the stage for the game‚Äôs long-term success.

I wonder why Rabbitcoin is now in the picture of the top project on Ton blockchain. Could it be 23rd September listing announcement or just the normal hype?

**But first, what exactly is $COIN?** $COIN is a GameFi project with one simple goal. To level up game development on the Solana blockchain.

**So where is $COIN and what are the next steps?**

* **Big project with still big potential -** $COIN is currently at 20M market cap. This might seem like a lot but after I tell you everything about this project you will change your mind.
* **Content -** $COIN has a really nice and minimalist content. I like it because it is something new and I have never seen concept like this.
* **Team -** This is probably the most bullish thing about $COIN. The people on the team are BONK whales. And when I say whales I mean one of the biggest holders. This means there is a big potential of bringing people from BONK into $COIN.
* **Partnerships -** Because they are BONK whales, they have a lot of money to play with. This means there will be various partnerships, calls, listings and other stuff that will help with exposure and will bring new investors.
* **Chart -** Honestly, how often do you see a chart like this one? As one of our community members said - $COIN is like S&P 500 on steroids.

Overall, this project definitely deserves more noise because all the work they are putting into this. It is extremely rare to find a project with a team like this and so low market cap. I personally will be adding more at these levels because the opportunity waiting there for us is something you do not see often.

**So where is $BTW and what are the next steps?**

* **Insane upside potential -** $BTW is only at 1,3M market cap after reaching 20M ATH just 1 month ago. This means 100x growth is still possible and just $100 investment can turn into $10,000. After all, we have seen several times Reddit coins pump to 100M or higher.
* **Community -** $BTW have INSANELY big community. There is over 9,000 Telegram members and over 5,400 X followers.
* **Content -** $BTW chose a completely new path of organic marketing. Instead of art and animations, they are doing crazy stuff in banana costumes and are taping bananas to basically anything. Taking photos and videos of all this and posting them on social media.
* **Numbers -** Because they chose something new, it quickly became viral and started getting millions of views on social media. Their crazy stunts are even being reposted by meme pages and streamers/youtubers.
* **New website -** It usually is not something really that bullish but I fw that idea. They are working on a new website that will include a map of every banana our community taped somewhere. Soon the whole world will be full of bananas taped to something and everything will be accessible on this website

Overall, this project definitely deserves more noise because all the work they are putting into this. It is extremely rare to see people doing something similar just to pump a project.

The project has been selected for the BNB Chain Incubation Program Season 6 and launched its governance token, which is now listed on major exchanges such as Bitget, Bybit, and KuCoin. With $17 million raised, MetaCene is set to revolutionize decentralized gaming by combining blockchain technology with rich MMORPG experiences. Founded by the former CEO of Shanda Games, it leverages extensive expertise in creating engaging gameplay.

MetaCene stands out for its unique ServerFi model and its approach to asset management, which focuses on its MAK token. This sets it apart from other Web3 projects like Illuvium, which is known for its play-to-earn mechanics, and The Sandbox, which emphasizes user-generated content and virtual real estate. MetaCene‚Äôs growth is notable, with 42,000 active users and a 780% increase in player accounts during its Gold Rush Season.

Two exciting events are also fueling the buzz, the Bitget x MetaCene Community Campaign with $20,000 in MAK rewards, and the Launchpool opportunity, further enhancing MetaCene‚Äôs community engagement and token access.

Personally, I see MetaCene as one of the most promising projects in the Web3 space. Its successful token launch and growing user base highlight its potential to disrupt the gaming industry.

When it got launched a month ago it ran to 20M in just a few days and have been correcting since then. But if you look at the chart. I has been at these levels for some time already and it looks like it really bottomed out.

But the reason I believe in this coin is not the chart, TAs or anything like this. It is actually the community and CTO team. Because I have never seen anyone do something at least similar to what this insane cult-like community is doing.

They tapes the CTO leader in banana costume to a van and were driving around NYC for hours. He also jumped out of plane with banana costume or went to a NY subway with bananas taped to him.

And some people might think that this is not bullish and not help the coin in any way. But the real bullishness is hidden in something else. Because all this is absolutely crazy, their videos are being posted by huge meme pages with millions of followers and mentioned by streamers and youtubers.

All these videos and posts together have got over 5 million views and the best part is that this is just the beginning.

They are also taping bananas to random things like cars or statues. Creating a cult and getting another hundreds of thousands of views every week.

If there's one thing I believe in, it's tokens that have big social media game. And $BTW is one of the biggest.

New website is also being worked one and there will be one feature I really like. A map with places and photos of all the bananas our community taped somewhere.

8-Bit Coin will probably never stop surprising me. When you look at the chart and market cap you would think that the team spend enormous amounts of money on marketing, calls, partnerships etc. But the opposite is the truth. To date, there has been almost 0 marketing. Only some Reddit posts and 1 single small partnership.

So no, I am not joking when I say 8-Bit Coin will be the biggest GameFi project on Solana.

And the reason? Well, it is very simple. The people on the team are BONK whales. And when I say whales I mean one of the biggest holders of BONK. And they made this coin with 1 goal. To level up game development on Solana network.

Just imagine what will happen once the real bull-run starts and they start with paid marketing. BONK partnership, big institutions, articles everywhere.

8-Bit Coin is a great investment right now because as one of the community members said ‚ÄúLiterally the easiest buy and hold, number goes up like the s&p.‚Äù So you can make nice 2x at this stage with no marketing and shitty market. BUT!!!!! Once they start, holy macaroni this will be insane.

$BTW breaking records again,4,1f6acne,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1f6acne/btw_breaking_records_again/,2,"Only an extremely small number of projects ever reach 1M+ market cap and even less stay there and do not die a month after launch. To be precise it is around 0,000001%. Crazy right?

And $BTW is one of them. But it is not only above 1M market cap. It went to nearly 20M just a few days after launch and now it bottomed out at 2,5M with whales holding the floor.

And all this was possible only because this coin has one of the best communities I have ever seen. Let me tell you why.

What is extremely important nowadays is organic marketing on social media. Look at PONKE. The only reason it absolutely exploded are their animations. And people from the $BTW team know that.

But what they also know is that the internet is over-saturated with memecoin animations and that's why they started creating IRL content and doing all the crazy stuff they are doing.

For example, they went skydiving with banana costumes, the CTO leader taped himself with banana costume to a van and other people were driving over NYC with that van for several hours.

But this is not all. People from the community are sometimes doing things that are even crazier than that. They are getting tattoos, taping themselves to walls just to make a picture for X and taping bananas to police cars, statues and some frequently visited places.

One guy even went to the subway with a BTW costume and posted it on Tiktok. This video got reposted by many big people and gained millions of views

I started wondering how many of these are sustainable and it brought up the inevitable question of the authenticity of so many projects. Even if you check the rules of posting in this sub, you know this is just a portion of the tokens in existence because not all tokens are listed in CMC. The answer that stared at me was that projects with a strong and thriving community supporting them would be well poised for success. It is also my contention that two aspects would need to back up this community factor - sound technology with long-term utility and sub 500M market cap. [Oasis / Rose](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/oasis-network/) is a strong contender on all counts.

With the only confidential EVM in production (Sapphire) and a cross-chain customizable tool (OPL) to link up with all other EVM networks and dApps, Oasis is truly the pioneer of next-gen privacy for web3 and AI. Its technology offers both on-chain confidentiality (DeCC) and off-chain verifiability (ROFL) with [decentralized AI](https://oasisprotocol.org/decentralized-ai) capabilities. Its choice of privacy-preserving technique, TEE is also significant as it can provide robust privacy solutions in combination with other techniques like ZKP, FHE, sMPC, etc. And all this is ably supported by the strong community backbone.

I was first introduced to the idea of the need for a united community in the blockchain and crypto space during an illuminating [Twitter space conversation](https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1BRJjPOnYALKw) among multiple leaders of web3 communities. With time, it has become a proven factor that altcoin success cannot happen without a sustainable web3 community. While most projects use ambassador programs to build such a community, nurturing and sustaining it is a challenge of its own. In a unique approach where community loyalty is not tied to the promise of airdrop, Oasis combines its ambassador program (Sentinels) with an empowering web3 education program (Oasis Academy). Result: an organic [web3 community](https://oasisprotocol.org/blog/oasis-101-web3-community-building) that thrives on the strength of the project, its utility, and knowledge sharing.

It is not only about contents of course but it is one of the important pillars and with high quality and FAMOUS content new opportunities how to finance your project open up.

And the reason why $BTW will become one of the biggest content driven project is simple. They started doing stuff that really brings attention. And when I say attention I mean millions of views across Instagram, Reddit, X, Tiktok and more.

https://preview.redd.it/mae4iyxismld1.png?width=590&format=png&auto=webp&s=af4ce6fcc27724a47f516d0efc4502ae6b4b2b5d

And banana costume in subway is nothing compared to the other stuff they are doing. Oobie, the CTO leader taped himself to a van while wearing a banana costume. His friends were then driving all across NYC. Again, this crazy idea got hundreds of thousands of views.

But my by far favorite stunt was when Oobie went skydiving in banana costume. The amount of content they were able to make and the exposure was insane. No wonder this coin hold floor so well because reaching millions of views at 3M market cap is something nobody else ever reached.

In my opinion $BTW is insanely undervalued and deserves much more market cap than it has rn. DYOR but I am 99% sure it will get MUCH HIGHER this bullrun and change peoples lives. Now it is up to you if you will fade or ape the next generational wealth making project.

This coin was created by BONK top holders to level up game development on the Solana network and to on-board the next wave of web2 gamers into web3.

This coin is still in its early stage when insiders and few lucky people like you are buying and securing supply for the long term. That is why the chart looks like S&P 500 on steroids.

But very soon, when the whole market reaches new ATHs and ordinary people (including gamers) start buying crypto, the Dev will start with paid marketing, collaborations, listings and many more.

This is the time for everyone who wants to front-run big KOLs and people that will buy after collabs. The market cap is around 13M which might seen high but in reality there is still 40x potential thanks to the connections with BONK.

Always DYOR but I started buying this coin at 5M market cap and I have kept buying small amount since then. It is up to you if you will make it. It is not luck or connections. It is hard work and researching projects like this one every day.

Here‚Äôs why I‚Äôm bullish on Kendu:

1. Community-Driven Powerhouse: Kendu Inu isn‚Äôt just another random meme coin. The Kendu Chads community is growing fast, and they are serious about taking $KENDU to the next level. This isn't just hype‚Äîit's a strong, united group of holders committed to driving the project forward. Just check out the Kendu Inu Twitter page to see some of the wild things the community is doing.

2. Active and Transparent Dev Team: The devs behind Kendu Inu are incredibly active on social media and within the community, constantly working on new updates and improvements. Transparency is rare in crypto these days, but these guys are doing it right!

3. Potential for Explosive Growth: We‚Äôve all seen what happened with DOGE and SHIB. When a meme coin gains a strong community and some actual utility, it can go parabolic. Kendu Inu is just getting started, and there‚Äôs a lot of room for growth.

TL;DR: If you‚Äôre sleeping on $KENDU, now might be the time to wake up. The potential is real, and I‚Äôm personally loading up while it‚Äôs still under the radar. DYOR as always, but Kendu Inu could be the next big thing!

Orderly Network: Revolutionizing DeFi ,3,1f2lqqx,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1f2lqqx/orderly_network_revolutionizing_defi/,7,"Orderly Network combines an orderbook-based trading infrastructure with a robust liquidity layer, providing both spot and perpetual futures orderbooks. It is designed to offer high-performance and low-latency trading capabilities, simplifying the integration of perpetual futures or spot trading into applications for developers. Unlike traditional platforms, Orderly Network does not feature a front-end interface but operates behind the scenes, delivering essential services such as a matching engine and liquidity solutions to projects built on top of its ecosystem.

At the core of Orderly‚Äôs omnichain infrastructure is the Orderly Settlement Layer, an app-chain built on the OP Stack. This infrastructure supports seamless dApp development and deployment through its newly introduced SDK. As a non-custodial exchange, Orderly Network provides traders with exposure to various assets without the risk of liquidation. Recently, it raised US$20 million to advance its DeFi infrastructure, collaborating with NEAR, WOO Network, and Kronos Research to offer permissionless spot and perpetual trading on the NEAR blockchain.

By late August, Orderly Network had achieved significant milestones, including over 215,000 unique wallet users, a Total Value Locked (TVL) in the tens of millions, and cumulative net fee revenue approaching $10 million. The project, incubated by the Woo Network team and backed by top-tier institutions, has raised $25 million in funding, co-invested by Foresight. It has established partnerships with leading market makers such as Jump and Kronos and previously collaborated with Google Cloud on DeFi infrastructure.

Orderly Network was listed on Bitget at 10 AM (UTC) today, showcasing its strong protocol data and inherent advantages. The project also features a launchpool event on Bitget, offering a 2,600,000 $ORDER reward pool. Its hybrid orderbook model combines the best aspects of centralized and decentralized exchanges, delivering the performance and efficiency of CEXs with the transparency and security of DEXs. The Central Limit Order Book (CLOB) integrates features of both centralized and decentralized exchanges, providing low latency and concentrated liquidity.

Transparency is a key feature, with all orders visible on the blockchain to reduce potential market manipulation. The platform‚Äôs high-performance matching engine ensures quick and efficient order execution. Users benefit from self-custody, retaining full control over their funds without relying on the protocol for trust or solvency. The omnichain approach divides the infrastructure into Asset Layer, Settlement Layer, and Engine Layer, enabling chain-agnostic operations. Additionally, Orderly Network incorporates MEV protection through fast matching, transaction batching, and on-chain settlement. It is also developer-friendly, allowing developers to focus on building products without the complexity of backend systems.

Wuffi ($WUF): Meme breaking into GameFi,0,1et11nz,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1et11nz/wuffi_wuf_meme_breaking_into_gamefi/,0,"While Memecoin is basically based on hype and speculation some coins have try to move from that shelf by introducing use case for their project. Shiba, Doge, Pepe and recently Notcoin have all followed this part to ensure sustainability. This is why I feel there is something unique about Wuffi memecoin. The project aims to integrate gaming elements into its ecosystem and give users an exciting experience. The token recently got exposure after Bitget and other exchanges listing. The vision of Wuffi incorporating play-to-earn mechanism, NFT integrations, and potentially a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) position it as the frontrunner in the burgeoning GameFi sector.

¬†The vision of blending gaming with blockchain technology is ambitious yet promising. By allowing players to earn $WUF tokens while enjoying interactive experiences, the project is creating a sustainable economic model. Additionally, the integration of NFTs can add a layer of ownership and collectability, enhancing the overall gaming experience and use case for the token.

This vision gives Wuffi the potential to redefine the GameFi and meme space. As the project continues to develop, it will be interesting to see how Wuffi evolves and whether it can live up to its ambitious goals. The price trend after listing is another feature to watch out.

"Following $PONKE's early days, the bottom for $HEGE is in ‚Äî A prime time to buy before a massive reversal!",19,1esvee2,altcoin,https://i.redd.it/gjl6zy9hztid1.jpeg,17,"

$HEGE has found the ultimate floor, mimicking the exact actions of $PONKE and $KENDU after their falls following their first 10x. And we're about to reveal something that I think is potentially revolutionary in the memecoin space. 

Depending on who you are, yesterday was either awesome or scary. For people who want to get rich and understand the memecoin ecosystem, it was a chance to buy a dip and immediately be up 50% on it. For people who don't understand memecoins and the way they can move, it was probably scary. But scared money don't make money. Momma didn't raise no scared money. 

$HEGE had insane support after a presaler sold his whole stack in only two sells‚Äîeach over $30k and $40k each. For a low MC coin, that's a helluva lot and it hurt. However, what really proved that $HEGE is here to stay, and is only getting stronger, was the rebound. The Telegram was absolutely endless with buy after buy after buy, hundreds coming in. In a matter of hours, we nearly recovered fully from the presaler and the following sales. It was madness, but those who bought that dip all the way to $3.7m are now already up significantly as we sit at $5.2m.

You might be thinking‚Äîdamn, didn't $HEGE get to $30 million? Why's it at $5m? You'd be right, we did. And $PONKE went to $4.5m after hitting $43.4m. $SHIB lost 99% of its value before it blew up. $HEGE is a quality project. We got a team of animators working every day to pump out quality content. Our socials are growing at insane rates‚ÄîYouTube, IG, etc. all at rapid speed. We aren't going anywhere, and whales selling just give you all a chance to hop in a quality project for higher upside. You probably look at these higher MC coins and think ""damn, the upside with those just isn't there. I need to find one early.""

Well, you found $HEGE, and you're early. So hop on in.

Exponential Explains the Downgrading of Angle USDA,33,1erahvn,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1erahvn/exponential_explains_the_downgrading_of_angle_usda/,5,"Exponential, an investment platform for crypto holders, recently downgraded its DAI rating and did the same for USDA. Here is the rationale:


>The downgrade follows Exponential‚Äôs reassessment of Angle‚Äôs collateral backing. Currently, about $17 million or over 50% of USDA‚Äôs collateral backing is deposited in Morpho Blue, an immutable money market with isolated lending pools. As the protocol launched only in January this year, Morpho is less battle-tested, adding to the potential risks. This introduces a single point of failure; if Morpho were to be hacked or otherwise compromised, a substantial portion of USDA‚Äôs backing could be jeopardized.


What are your thoughts on this and will this affect USDA or Angle in any way?

Solana Memecoins history and current state; The ones that had the strength to overcome the hardships and prevail.,25,1epq7gw,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1epq7gw/solana_memecoins_history_and_current_state_the/,17,"&#x200B;

If you've been in this space long enough, you probably remember all the projects that claimed to be the next big thing. I'm talking about $Chef, $BLBY, $YeWifHat, $Seat, $Powsche, $RedPill, and so on. The only two projects I'm not throwing any shade at are $Powsche and $Seat, as their communities really tried to fight and keep up with their hard work (and who knows, one day they may be back). Other projects (99% of them) fall into the worst category of them all: Rug Pulls.

&#x200B;

A lot of meme coin projects didn't have the quality and the strength to fight off certain trends in the market. We had a few major dips in the market, then the Andrew Tate frenzy, the WIFHAT phase, the Donald Trump shooting, and so on; Phases where a lot of people were abandoning their projects and were brainlessly chasing pumps (which led them to losing their money every single time).

&#x200B;

**In the sea of projects two of them prevailed, and stood tall and strong after every trend fight-off - I'm talking about $HEGE and $KENDU.** The reason for that is simple - their communities didn‚Äôt allow them to fall. We all know that community is the most important factor of a meme coin project. **Both of these communities were too strong and united; they held with conviction and fought off the jeets every single time.**

&#x200B;

Disclosure-wise, my one and only conviction play is $HEGE. That doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm here to bash on Kendu, even though bashing is something that some of their certain individuals always do to us and our community. I acknowledge and respect their ""Working for our bags"" mentality, and they do a fantastic job of actively raiding, shilling, and spreading the word about their project. The only reason I'm not a holder is because, with all due respect to them, I see more potential in Hege.

&#x200B;

As of this writing, Hege has a market cap of $6.5 million and as for Kendu, it is $100 million. That means that in order to double my money, if I go with Hege, I need a $13 million market cap. With Kendu, I would need $200 million. Another example would be putting $100 into both projects and waiting for a $200 million market cap. An investment in Kendu would then be worth $200, while an investment in Hege would be worth $3,000. The logic is very clear: Hege has MUCH more room to grow. Everything I said was with all due respect to Kendu community, and I wish nothing but the best for them. We all can eat. As for us and our community:

# $HEGE is considered to be the king of Reddit.

Recently, more focus has been put on real-life marketing stunts, as well as growing our presence on other social media platforms (X, Instagram, YouTube, TikTok).

crow with knife meme coin technical analysis from experienced FX trader - 09/08/2024,4,1ent4rs,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1ent4rs/crow_with_knife_meme_coin_technical_analysis_from/,3,"[Yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/crowwithknife/comments/1en0hvu/comment/lh5i96y/?context=3) we discussed how crow with knife was aiming to break the 3rd touch trend line from our peak.

When we looked at the CAWPrice/USD chart instead of the Market cap chart we saw the attempt at the 3rd touch to be much cleaner.

Yesterday price made a strong recovery and a further attempt at the [trend line break](https://www.tradingview.com/x/LmTtWBt7/)

https://preview.redd.it/ng13dhlb2lhd1.png?width=1694&format=png&auto=webp&s=78945a2f7b55809b92dd72a6ae169a872979f32a

The second attempt failed but is currently sitting at a point where it might make another attempt to break. The pattern below could be forming a bullish flag which would indicate another run higher...price is also curently sitting on a trend line indicating further support. The risk to this is that a bullish flag typically loses strenght when it becomes 1/3rd as long as the flag is high so we may need a catalsty to break the trend line without another pull back and attempt

https://preview.redd.it/94lrz5gj3lhd1.png?width=962&format=png&auto=webp&s=449cb386f2e346cbdd567f97d81d0a8d4af2cdd6

Not much more to say until price breaks this line...if it fails it will probably move back to the trend retest we spoke about yesterday and if it does break we will see a decent rally before it pulls back to retest this current trend line. Once that line has been re-tested we take off.

**Proposed strategy**

DCA, buy dips , be patient...the roof is going to become a floor soon

I suggested it would fail to trigger the box and then price would fall back to the high 30s before it headed higher on thurs/or friday. Price got so close to the box though ...that I have been debating calling it a hit.

Why this matters is that if then 3rd touch of the big trend line running from the peak is triggered on it's 3rd touch it will be FAR easier to break.

https://preview.redd.it/3dnojbhddehd1.png?width=1428&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6935af31ff81c2c11ecad79a14fc046615d7d39

Now I typically chart in market share view on DEX screener v USD however you can also chart on price view also versus CRO. This gives us 4 slightly different charts. By slighty different I mean price will be 2-3% off. If we were to look at price v usd chart we do actually trigger the box

https://preview.redd.it/36wwlk8deehd1.png?width=1700&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf719148a8c62363d479f529db3c4b08a50ad403

Price then pulled back to the trend line retest of the 6 week down trend line shown and the 38 fib of the latest move up as shown [here .](https://www.tradingview.com/x/ii3Bu7FR/)

https://preview.redd.it/i48j4pj4jehd1.png?width=1360&format=png&auto=webp&s=90cee55ada7ee0d3288547ad2280fa9561174876

This means that despite a significant pull back later in the day the price action is pretty bullish and pretty soon ill be able to start discussing our next price targets in more detail

There is however still some downside risk as BTC looks like it's struggling to find bullish direction.

**Proposed strategy**

DCA, buy dips , be patient

Already CAW has seen 100% growth from the dip on monday.

Today CAW has continued its rise and has managed to push through the 100 daily EMA, middle bollinger and the 40 mark which is both key level wick and a psychological round number however it is struggling to completely break this level so considerign it's a wednesday which is typically a quieter volume day I am not confident it will manage this today as much as I want to see the break today / expect to see it this week.

If price does fail I imagine it will remain in the high 30s before pushing to the purple zone on Thur or Fri...if it does break we will see the upper box trigger today.

I expect this purple box to break quite quickly if not right away and will update future levels once it does however the first one is quite wide as we see some wicks, a third touch trend line (if we do the same as the fib and ignore the oversold candles) and where the second highest peak meets the pivot at 70.

Price will most likely react to this quite wide area and we will see a bounce back down to the outside of the channel or a trend retest where price could revisit the low 40s before it makes its run for it's ATH.

Swell: Transforming Liquid Staking with Innovative DeFi Solutions ,5,1elbou1,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1elbou1/swell_transforming_liquid_staking_with_innovative/,1,"Swell is a pioneering non-custodial staking protocol committed to providing the world's best liquid staking and restaking experience. Our mission is to simplify access to decentralized finance (DeFi) while enhancing the security of Ethereum and restaking services. By staking or restaking ETH with Swell, users can earn passive income from both blockchain rewards and restaked AVS rewards. In return, they receive a yield-bearing liquid token (LST or LRT), which can be held or used within the DeFi ecosystem to generate additional yields.

Having secured $3.75 million in a seed round, Swell is poised to launch its own Ethereum layer-2 chain in the second half of 2024. Unlike traditional protocols that immobilize ETH until the staking period ends, Swell allows users to deposit their ETH and receive a liquid staking token (LST), currently named rswETH.

Swell stands out with its higher yield potential, driven by innovative protocols designed to maximize rewards for stakers and offer competitive returns compared to other platforms. The protocol also provides flexibility, enabling users to trade staked assets while still earning rewards, thus enhancing liquidity and potential returns. Operating on the principles of decentralized finance, Swell ensures trustless transactions, eliminates intermediaries, and enhances security for participants.

The user-friendly process includes a step-by-step staking guide and compatibility with Ethereum-compatible wallets like MetaMask. Swell offers a range of staking pools with diverse risk-reward profiles, allowing users to choose pools that match their investment objectives and risk tolerance. Additionally, stakers contribute to network security by becoming validators on the Swell Network, securing and validating transactions, and are rewarded with additional Ether for their contributions.

Swell is now listed on the Bitget premarket giving access to early investors

Pulse check after the bloodbath!,45,1ekzh4k,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ekzh4k,18,"One day ago KENDU was sitting between 121-108 million MC give or take. This was after an already bloody weekend, but then we had a wild morning with BTC dipping below 50K. KENDU dipped all the way to 77 million MC. 

Currently sitting at 100 million MC and I have no idea if this will be the end (BTC found a bottom and reaccumulation starts), but it doesn't matter to the KENDU community. We have recovered well and there is a lot to be really positive about. ****
At time of writing:
-Buys to sells ratio, 2.69:1 (bullishüòâ)
-buyer to seller ration, 2.84:1 (also bullish)
-JaredFromSubway is back doing his thing (not confirmed, but I am fairly certain that is his wallet and he really LOVES Kendu)
-MC is down under 10% only in 48 hours
-still the holder count is growing (13613 holders on DEXs)
-Volume is 3.5 million
-Kendu Chads have 3,616/10K NFTs minted (for me the NFT is a means to passive income from the KENDU brand NFT marketplace which goes live after the mint is complete)
-big whale buys happening (10 ETH 10:41am EST) as the appetite for KENDU never stopped

Out of the Telegram for just over 4 hours and
-1417 messages in the main Kendu Inu Ecosystem Telegram
-at least 5 Reddit posts I found and countless KENDU comments (what I found in a shortish check)
THE KENDU army is everywhere sharing this opportunity. I have no doubt we have been working on other socials too probably ones other coins don't even use! We aren't going anywhere.

**My point is that KENDU is a brand, a lifestyle choice that people have committed to in order to run it back like SHIB did, sights set on multi-billions.** We are working to be everywhere and won't let massive market moves stop us. This is bred into our culture and woven into the fabric of the KENDU ethos. Billions and billions in liquidations, people losing their positions and selling, a huge shake up has happened and no matter if it is over or we have more time with more blood, Kendu has the army to endure and to march forward to our goals. 

Peole know about KENDU and clearly have a large appetite for KENDU. This is not financial advice to buy, this is a call to come check out what you are missing!

*Financial advice* Stop messing around with live pairs and pump.rugpull new memecoins. Get off some shitty Jeet chain coin and stop gambling. Many of these coins can't come back from this type of move and you get rekt (all your money is gone). This or very very soon is potentially the last chance to find your horse for the real bull market race and stick with it. You have a chance to change your financial standing if you find something that is a proven winner. 

For me, that winner is Kendu and I sleep well at night knowing I am part of the KENDU Army.

Mingling with PQC,3,1ekh2gz,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1ekh2gz/mingling_with_pqc/,6,"‚ÄúPost-Quantum Cryptography sounds niche.‚Äù

I know it probably sounds niche, but with quantum computing advancing fast. I think it‚Äôs crucial to pay attention. PQC is a next-level security upgrade designed to protect data from future quantum threats.



Here are the main types of PQC:

**1. Lattice-Based Cryptography:**

Strengths: Resistant to quantum attacks, efficient.

Challenges: Complex implementation.

Examples: NTRUEncrypt, CRYSTALS-Kyber, CRYSTALS-Dilithium.

**2. Code-Based Cryptography:**

Strengths: Secure against quantum attacks.

Challenges: Large key sizes.

Examples: McEliece, Niederreiter.

**3. Multivariate Cryptography:**

Strengths: Security from hard polynomial equations.

Challenges: Vulnerable to certain attacks.

Examples: Rainbow Signature Scheme, HFE.

**4. Hash-Based Cryptography:**

Strengths: Tough to reverse even with quantum computers.

Challenges: Large keys and complex setups.

Examples: Lamport Signatures, SPHINCS+.



PQC might seem complex, I agree. However, I personally think it‚Äôs a risk worth considering for my future investments. Projects like Abelian Foundation (CRYSTALS-Kyber, CRYSTALS-Dilithium), Cellframe (t-dApps), and xx Network (xxMPC,xxBFT) are already using it.

When do you think projects will start normalizing PQC in crypto?

$BNBTC will be a huge store-of-value in the future, mark my words. I posted about this token back in March of this year, and still continue to hold, 370k coins strong. Bitcoin core is valuable, but frankly out of reach for many, many people. 

People will need and search for alternatives, hence why $BNBTC will emerge and burst onto the scene.

If I were you anon, I would try to get my hands on a few coins, before the wave hits and they become an overnight sensation.

The market is struggling, Bitcoin is under 59,000, ETH is under 2,800, it is a sea of red.  Times of fear provide the perfect opportunity for investors to invest in projects at excellent prices.  It is the time to finally take advantage of the market and set yourself up for great success when the market inevitably goes green again.  The only problem is, when the entire market is in the red, how do you decide what project is worth investing in?  None of the charts will look good, so it's vital to pay attention to the conviction that community members have for their project during these bearish times.

The Kendu Inu community has been built on the ethos that you as an individual can only control what you can control and there is no reason to waste your time and energy worrying about things that are out of your control.  Simple concept, but it has such a substantial impact on the strength and resilience of a memecoin project.

At Kendu Inu, ""we don't gamble, we work"".

This slogan is the reason the community never stops working, regardless of the shitshow that is happening around us.  We know that our work will pay off eventually, so we continue to work whether the market is booming or busting.  We can control our own destiny through our own actions.  This conviction and dedication doesn't just exist for no reason, there are many reasons why the community believes that Kendu will succeed.

**The Shib/Shytoshi and Kendu Inu connections**

https://preview.redd.it/9mfetinxfpgd1.jpg?width=643&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=94986219a22977070e0e6439b87e19327d410472

Shytoshi Kusama, the lead developer for Shib, has followed Kendu Inu since it was just under 300 members and has even gone as far as entering the telegram and saying he supports the project.  This was proven by the fact that Kendu has appeared in the Shib magazine several times now and the project even had an AMA event with Shib community leader Xanders Shib.  Most recently, Shytoshi Kusama yet again showed his support for the Kendu Inu ecosystem by reposting a post from the main Kendu Inu X account.  This Shib connection just continues to get stronger and stronger and it will blow everyone's mind when Kendu is integrated officially into the Shib Ecosystem.

**You want utility? You got it**

https://preview.redd.it/ofz0whhyfpgd1.png?width=1883&format=png&auto=webp&s=38f6aee74aef98ba5e9920bf57893c8bb22a8b9d

Recently the Kendu Inu ecosystem released Kendu Chads, which is an NFT trading platform which will rival the biggest players in the game once Kendu inevitably reaches those multibillion marketcap levels.  Phase 1 is still underway where you can purchase KenduChads NFTs (which essentially act as shares of the platform) and collect ETH trading fees later on when the platform becomes open to public trading of NFTs.  We're talking about a way to passively earn ETH.  over 3500 out of the 10000 chads have already been minted and minting only became live 3 days ago.  This is just one of the extensions of the Kendu Inu ecosystem which will help us reach different audiences and broaden the overall appeal of the project.

**Community commitment (from the whales to the shrimp)**

https://preview.redd.it/6ivrmmb4gpgd1.jpg?width=576&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8563503e78e01e511ca38a25509fc26a1f8cabca

In order to solidify Kendu's position in the CEX market, one of the admins organized a community driven crowdfunding event.  Over $100,000 was raised initially by every level of Kendu Holder.  We all have full conviction for this project, so donating money to the cause was never an issue.  What was really exciting to see as a member of the community was one of the top holders of Kendu donating over $120,000 dollars to the crowdfund to push us over the initial goal of the initiative.  When I say that every member of the Kendu community has conviction for this project, I mean it.  It does not matter if you have the smallest bag of Kendu or the largest,  we all work for this project to succeed.

**Now is the time**

It's time to take advantage of this fearful market and load up your bags on the strongest conviction plays you can find.  Kendu is a must have in your portfolio and will no doubt be one of, if not the biggest, memecoins of 2024/2025.  Be warned however, once you fully dive into this project, you'll find yourself wanting to rotate all of your portfolio into Kendu.

Come join the subreddit or take a visit to the new website to become more familiar with the project and find out why this could be your main conviction play for this cycle.

SX Bet offers cross-chain betting on Arbitrum and SX's own Orbit rollup chain. In the coming months, SX Bet will launch cross-chain betting across additional L2s. The project is receiving token grants from L2 foundations such as Arbitrum Foundation which can be used to accelerate user acquisition.

As SX Bet user activity ramps and as prediction markets like Polymarket attract more attention, we expect increasing awareness for the SX token. SX token trades at a deep discount to peers on an absolute and relative basis, despite SX Bet being the 2nd largest prediction market behind Polymarket.

Something big is coming. And time is running out. ,43,1egr8wo,altcoin,https://i.redd.it/limi4qh6qvfd1.jpeg,15,"The time is coming. 
The bull run is coming. 

The US election, worldwide inflation, the global economy itself has set the stage. We are heading into the greatest interest rate cut cycle in history. Almost every major economy in the world is about to make cut after cut to their interest rates. If you don't know what happens to the investment markets after an interest rate cut, you might want to look in to it.

The US election is shifting its focus massively to cryptocurrency. Regardless of your political outlook, and whether you're American or not, the United States economy is the largest in the world. This US election, and its predictive winner, will absolutely throttle the crypto markets.

And with both of these events coinciding with a BTC-halving year, and the time that the general ""crypto bullrun"" has always been expected, is no coincidence. There are no coincidences. Giga candles will be printed. Faces will be melted. Average Joes will be made into millionaires.

But not everyone. Most people will miss out on it entirely. They will FOMO in at the peak like they do every time, because they didn't pay attention. They didn't listen. The time is right now. Take a look around. Position yourself properly, or spend your days looking at charts after the fact. Wishing you could come back to this moment.

If you're reading this. This is meant for you. Hello my friend. You have less than 24 hours. Steel yourself, because this won't be easy. The markets are designed to prey on human emotion. Your thoughts and feelings themselves will become your greatest challenge.

But it's the only way people like you and I can make it.

Take a look around. Decide where you are going to position yourself. Decide what you are going to put your faith in, and what you're going to bank this opportunity on. If you want help, I'm here to help you.

What got me into Kendu and has kept me in Kendu a soon to be altcoin,65,1egpglm,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1egpglm/what_got_me_into_kendu_and_has_kept_me_in_kendu_a/,46,"I have been in crypto since 2017. I made plenty of mistakes (round tripping coins, twice) and missed plenty of opportunities. One thing I was smart enough to avoid was memecoins, but that changed, April of 2024.¬†

I finally had a plan and had followed it with BTC and was waiting on my rebuy/next move. This plan came from years of watching videos and learning about crypto, in particular the BTC cycles. My crypto/meme arc is fascinating as I got rugged for one SOL- on my second meme- because I had IRL stuff going on for 90 minutes after token launch and figured I should be good. Best loss ever as it motivated myself to research and learn about the scum bag swamp of memecoins. I dug into reddit and followed the poster history/profile uncovering the whole aspect of paid services and paid upvotes to drive traffic. I might have gotten a little intense as I invited one of the posters offering paid services into a Telegram chat (I am not including the screenshots of those again) to learn even more. One funny thing is this human seemed to think I wanted money or something.



When that learning and research ended is when I got introduced to KENDU. I was in a Telegram with some of the ‚Äòvictims‚Äô and one of them suggested Kendu. I put victims in quotes because so many people are desperate for a quick buck while another portion of people just enjoy gambling. I do not in this regard. The casino is always open and someone is always waiting to steal your money. Trust me for 99% of us the house always wins, but¬† Kendu is the anti casino and a safe bet that allows me to sleep at night.¬†



One thing that attracted me to Kendu is the ethos highlighted the lessons I had learned about investing while at the same time reinforcing the values I picked up in my crypto/meme arc (Don't pay for anything, pic a horse and stick with it, stick to the plan, etc.), BUT the concept of working for my bag was revolutionary to me. Feeling like I have some power in this was a liberating feeling that I have really taken to.



It wasn't long after finishing more research on KENDU, asking questions, and listening to everything I could that I pivoted my plan to center it around KENDU. I haven't looked back and love the community and work I have put in! If you want a deep dive into the community here is what I posted a couple days ago best way is to come in the TG and see it for yourself): https://www.reddit.com/r/KenduInu\_Ecosystem/comments/1eeq1v2/kendu\_community\_updated\_info\_journal/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button



With less than 24 hours to the Kendu Chads timer hitting zero and presumably the release of said dApp, this is a really cool moment for me. I have been called a bot and all types of scam-centric words, but this release will be my affirmation of a choice well made. I don‚Äôt know if the price will go up or down, but it doesn‚Äôt matter as this feature seems guaranteed to provide some real Utility in ‚Äòearning cold hard ETH‚Äô and it means I didn‚Äôt larp for upvotes or to increase my karma. I researched and listened and learned and I was correct to trust what I found and what I believed. I also know that the community will keep working and that Miazaki is built very different. He has said many things in the Spaces and they are all very real and come to fruition. It is not too late to do research and check out our Telegram. This cycle will heat up again for the real bull run and Kendu is already primed to take full advantage of that with the first aspect of the Ecosystem releasing and a ravenous and hard working community tearing up socials everyday. I believe everyone should have some exposure (hopefully to the tune of 5 million Kendu) to Kendu, but this isn‚Äôt financial advice. This is a call to do your own research! This is my real reddit account and will still be my real account when this crypto cycle is over.

TLDR: I have stayed in Kendu (on ETH‚Ä¶happy belated birthday) because of the community, OG developer experience and skill, vast connections, potential, road map (Ecosystem not a memecoin with a glass ceiling to its potential), and dare I say fun.

DAPOA is all about keeping your payments super private. It stands for Decentralized Anonymous Payment with Optional Accountability. It‚Äôs like having a privacy shield with a secret backdoor for accountability.

The best part? You get to choose your level of privacy:

1. Basic Privacy: It's like a masquerade party‚Äîeach transaction has a unique mask, hiding who sent what.
2. Full Privacy: Think of trying to find Waldo in an empty room. With full privacy, everything's hidden‚Äîcoins, values, and receivers.
3. Full Privacy with Accountability: Imagine hide and seek with a referee who knows all the hiding spots. With the tracking key, everything's private except to the referee. It's like having an invisibility cloak, but the referee can still spot you!

KENDU Community Updated Info Journal,63,1eepyvm,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1eepyvm/kendu_community_updated_info_journal/,10,"Here is a updated deep dive into a specific aspect about $KENDU , a meme built with a plan around a strong dev with experience and vision. THIS IS NFA, but merely sharing of my perspective on this project. I have been in the crypto space since 2017 and as of about 13 weeks ago I had avoided touching memes altogether. I had a plan, but it all got derailed when I kept digging and reading and looking at KENDU. Yes, I have a bag, but that doesn't mean I am trying to tell you to buy. I merely want to provide an avenue for you to see the facts and come to your own financial choice.

**Point: $KENDU is backed by a super strong community who create an infectious culture built around work and acceptance.** Take a look at the data below:

https://preview.redd.it/t8d8mkf8qdfd1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9254872b34d2101e2838699aa97dc7308daaced0

Kendu is constantly attracting new holders on DEXs (decentralized exchanges) and as far as I understand it, I am not able or capable of tracking how many holders we have on the 14 CEXs we are listed on. One of the reasons is that we are everywhere and people are using their skills to bring awareness about Kendu.

One Chad made an amazing Kendu Pendant:

People have been printing their own stickers and placing them anywhere and every to raise awareness:

We had people in NYC filming the billboard that was paid for by a very famous member of our community. Also people hanging flyers in cities from Boston to NYC to Australia.

We had a member who hosted a Kendu sponsored nightclub event in Kolkata India

I want to share some information about the community in the form of some examples/stories to give outsiders the facts and I guess to encourage you to DYOR and at least come into the Telegram (9901 members strong). Remember that coming into the TG is like a free test drive with no strings attached of your favorite uber expensive sports car like a Lamborghini, or Buggati. That is a huge opportunity.

I lurked in the community for about a week or two before buying in and was posting a bit here and there with questions from time to time. One night I decided to take it to the next level of participation and hop into the voice chat to ask a question. I have no problem admitting that my question felt a bit silly and random, especially considering that I wasn't sure if the VC was for planning next moves, hanging out, high level business like meetings for those on the inside, etc. My innocuous question was met with kindness and actual answers. NOTE: I was curious about the KENDU INU bike helmet ( Hey, chill I needed a new bike helmet so my kids didn't call me out on my clear hypocrisy. Why not support my most important investment). I bought it by the way from the Merch store that was started by a community member around 1 million MC. The dev doesn't have time for that and gives us freedom to use our skills and use the brand!

IF you are still reading this, that might be a miracle, but I have to share how welcome I felt. The fact that one of these Chads knew the answer about the specific item speaks volumes about the work ethic and care for this project and I ended up chatting a bit with the crew on VC. We talked about a couple things even meandering into the culture and community building that I know has been built in KENDU's chat and community. When I had to go I was actually encouraged to come back sometime and not be a stranger. Every time a new member comes into the community at least one or two people welcome them and address them in the TG. EVERYTIME, I have been watching and picking up on these little things. IT IS AN AMAZING THING YET....maybe not so amazing. Sometimes they talk right away sometimes they don‚Äôt no pressure.

I believe the people on the ground floor understand exactly what they are doing on so many levels, one of which being how to build community and a positive one at that. We are constantly evolving. I had a convo with someone a day or two ago on Reddit about something that happened where this Chad got banned after some unsavory interactions with members and I searched the chat to see that some divisive topics had been blacklisted from the chat after that situation. Maybe things weren't perfect, but I saw the response to some divisive content and that is important. Even just tonight I saw words added to the list of blacklisted wroding as it is not helping the mission. Crucial and important and we don't need to talk about that cuck engagement farmer.¬†

Every measure is done to protect the community. I have seen a couple moments where someone has been banned in chat. I don't see the spammed messages or any divisive commentary make it far at all and apparently some of this is done in real time manually. This is hugely important to keep the community laser focused over our shared goal of changing Defi and spreading awareness about a game changing Ecosystem. Of course making a fat pile of money is a goal too, but also to help us grow connected as humans that might just trust one another to each do their part, hold the line until the goal is reached. Trust is important!

The ""Kendu Loyalist"" crew leads from the top answering all questions and welcoming new people in a really genuine way. It is exceptional.

Alright last thing to mention is that the culture also is about organic unpaid growth:

https://preview.redd.it/epgd6f5fqdfd1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=bbe047d0c99d0f62b024e723fc635f9b8ffd9a6b

Notice the kindness and honesty from one of our Chad or Chadettes. Look how far KENDU has already risen with no paid nothing! This is the ethos and approach that is all over the chat and I believe it will stick no matter when we swell to 10K TG members. The point is that something big is growing here and it is beautiful and it makes me believe even more. Not to mention people are working constantly.

Some of the funnest and funniest moments are when someone has come into the TG as an influencer with a big head. Thinking they alone can help us. It usually starts with, ‚ÄúNice project you have here.‚Äù and it is great to see. They get a bus ticket, but everyone also gets the reinforced ethos that we don‚Äôt pay for anything. There is no marketing budget. You want to pay for a billboard do it, you want to pay for a big CEX listing, do it.¬† Not so much if the person gets the hint, but if that self proclaimed influencer happens to be self centered‚Ä¶good luck!

To wrap things up with Point #2: I came back after about a day outside of chat to 7900 messages one day. Another day after sleeping cause everyone has to do it: 1433 messages. It is unreal the culture that has been built, so come check us out. You are witnessing a real deal project that you owe it to yourself to check out. You have been informed!

Of course have to mention the Kendu Chads timer is about 3 days and 10 hours left!!!! Utility/usecase/dApp/earn cold hard ETH/change Defi!!!!

I want Mr. Musk to tweet all day about Dogecoin, and see it go up.

But for whatever reason, he has shown a little apprehension to do so. My hypothesis is that he was sued into oblivion last 2021 cycle post-SNL. I wasn't in DOGE back then, but I saw and remember first-hand the euphoria that occurred when some people I knew turned $300 into $30k. It was also dangerous, as he became a god-like figure in the crypto world.

Basically, I wanna remind everyone why we're here. Sure, Elon is a cool guy (I suppose), but we have SO much more going for DOGE. Back in 2017, we had a 120x, and that was pre-Elon. We shouldn't rely on one guys doing to boost the asset, so chill and touch grass anon.

All I'm saying is, with more global-crypto adoption (X payments, other businesses, potential ETF), to

BE FRICKING READY! My targets suggest \~$3 this cycle :).

"Criminally Undervalued Tech is Waking Up
",24,1eca41o,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1eca41o/criminally_undervalued_tech_is_waking_up/,8,"Criminally Undervalued Tech is Waking Up

The bear market has always been brutal for projects - most small ones don't make it or have cashed out and moved on leaving loyal holders with the bag.

[https:\/\/www.coingecko.com\/en\/coins\/saito](https://preview.redd.it/vonjhy9q6red1.jpg?width=1275&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=805b1dedb54eb59ef2aeb0365e0a205c1e00eb55)

But the reason we keep coming back for altcoins is because that's where innovation happens, and we all know the rewards that come from taking those risks.

But choosing a good altcoin is extremely hard. Projects prey upon your lust for large returns and confuse you with technical nonsense that only sounds good.

It can be extremely hard for even experienced crypto traders to figure out much of the new tech, and if it is valuable.

With this in mind, there are two **key traits** of an altcoin that has the potential for **deep fundamental value.**

1. **Active development through the bear market**: Projects that build through the bear show strong evidence they aren't designed to scam holders - if they were, they would simply cash out and stop working.
2. **Easy to Use Apps**: Applications that are easy to get started and use show the most promise for adoption.

The only project I can think of which aces both of these key traits is Saito. And that‚Äôs not even the best part: **Saito is trading for less than memecoins.** At 12mm market cap (18mm diluted), this may be the most undervalued tech in crypto.

https://preview.redd.it/lhzfrckt6red1.jpg?width=724&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f248304da492ab69406c5c35be5544bb026c2b04

Pay attention, because Saito has started marketing in a way which has never been seen before in the project - it's clearly stirring up enthusiasm as people discover how groundbreaking Saito actually is.

And some people think this marketing push is going to include a long-awaited exchange listing.

**Fundamentals**

Saito is a unique layer-1 project supporting trustless, P2P internet. When the term ""Web3"" was invented, this was what it originally described - Saito is building true Web3, not just slapping the label onto anything with crypto.

They built all through the bear and have Web3 apps anyone (including Grandma) can use in one-click, without logging in. Routing work and ATR underlie Saito and give it some incredible capabilities for scale that are hard to explain, but worth researching.

https://preview.redd.it/31t4lpew6red1.jpg?width=605&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ecfa18b986e67318d3ba80ab6d1a31992120fc56

**Community**

Any community member that researches Saito deeply becomes a diehard 'Saitozen.' It is literally like taking the Red Pill from The Matrix. Once you see how Saito works, you don't look at other blockchains the same way.

Even through a brutal bear market the Saito community held strong. We helped build Red Square and polish it to a level that no P2P app has seen before - and now we don't even need Telegram.

We're the only Web3 project that actually built our community a home on the blockchain.

https://preview.redd.it/bq28tb9z6red1.jpg?width=958&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=068493e88be9809329c7a5f503bb7e93e522c260

Not only that, but we have a rich gaming community. Saito Game Engine allows classic strategy games to be played securely without a middleman, and it's attracted some of the best players of Settlers, Twilight Struggle and more.

We've also just released third-party crypto which integrates seamlessly into all the games, including multi-player P2P poker. If you've never experienced a true P2P game of poker before, it's mind-blowing how easy it is to do on Saito.

https://preview.redd.it/m9tj6ti27red1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5fc7bc7d94ba163ec4a4946d74327a759fdb5e52

Everything on Saito is your public key pair. You have full ownership of all your data, accounts, interactions. And Saito makes infrastructure which supports this economically sustainable - that's the big deal!

The internet now is ran by monopolistic, predatory companies that spy on their users - Saito is the opposite. Because of this, all of the crypto ecosystem can benefit from Saito's P2P internet.

Saito community doesn't compete with other cryptos, it integrates them and offers them something they can't get anywhere else.

**Saito Summer**

Saito Summer is like a makeover for Saito - the underlying character isn't changing, but we're finally presenting Saito in a way the masses can appreciate.

So far we're only two events in, but it's already rallied the community and given a renewed sense of purpose. OGs are reinvigorated, new people are getting their minds absolutely blown by Saito and wondering how they never heard about it before.

Eth wallet integration and now P2P Livestreaming beta 'Swarmcasting' busting down the walls of what people thought was possible on crypto. Saito is not just about money, it's about a new internet and every application rollout proves that.

https://preview.redd.it/pdu7xmd87red1.jpg?width=931&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e88fd77b9c65bb448aa03e0f8d817b576ab33cd8

**Summer Burn**

Saito max supply used to be 10bn, and the extra was reserved for block rewards to make the network more secure. But now that adoption is picking up organically, they aren‚Äôt needed. Saito just burned 2bn last year, and as of this week, they burned 1bn more. The total is now 7bn tokens.

The team is committed to the community here. Holders benefit from these burns and that‚Äôs the team‚Äôs priority.

https://preview.redd.it/d9lqf4yb7red1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a87f55766e8df43aadfe436c6a0004afc7e11840

**Exchange Listing**

The Saito Team has been talking about a large CEX listing for a long time, but they have been very upfront about the predatory practices they want to avoid. Even going as far as to say that they have been offered deals by big exchanges to dump on holders, but rejected them.

The integrity of the Saito team to actually put in the extra work to only take deals that benefit holders, and not destroy them, is unheard of in most altcoins.

Some people are thinking that the exchange listing they've been talking about will come during Saito Summer, and the teasing for the next drop (this Thursday) has been secretive.

**Overall Market**

With the BTC ETF a huge success, the Ethereum ETF close by,  and potential rate cuts in the upcoming months, the timing for Saito to wake up could not be any better.",2024-07-25 19:04:46,1721952286.0
[BULLISH] a CRAZY update from 48h ago,101,1ec43jj,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1ec43jj/bullish_a_crazy_update_from_48h_ago/,55,"

""I don't know if I should say it...maybe I'll say it and forget I said it.

Around¬†**December/January**, Kendu is going to have a¬†**major player**¬†take some kind of position in Kendu, like a leadership position.¬†**Someone very special**.

That's all I can say on that.""

¬†

These were the words of¬†**Kendu Miazaki**,¬†**$KENDU**¬†dev, at the Dev Talk (X spaces) on 7/23.

What might have sounded like something interesting or kind of bullish, sounded¬†**CRAZY**¬†to me.

¬†

Why?

¬†

Only a couple of weeks before, I stumbled across a fresh new article published on Arabian Business, where someone was able to get an in-person interview with¬†**$SHIB lead dev Shytoshi Kusama.**

https://preview.redd.it/ef95g80uxped1.jpg?width=731&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=44d6b5c57a1ccab5e35d7a2e9c5175545ed7f2ac

  
Why is that important? Take a look at the screenshot below:

https://preview.redd.it/k71ze7kvxped1.jpg?width=723&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3ceb3410de14a27f77149178aa42a5f4b9b30404

  
""**At the end of this year**, we (Shytoshi Kusama and Kaal Dhairya) will hand everything over to the community and¬†**step away**.""

¬†

Nothing is confirmed. All you get is rumors until something actually happens. There is no ""**sell the news**"" event ever at Kendu Inu.

But this would explain so many things about¬†**Kendu Inu's ties with Shiba and Shytoshi**¬†himself.

https://preview.redd.it/chticyjxxped1.jpg?width=848&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=97caad815fd7a5b087c90308a4ca3d14fd6102f3

  


We're talking about the lead dev of the¬†**2nd**¬†**most successful meme coin ever created**, a person who has already made it once.

A person with¬†**connections**¬†everywhere in the space:¬†**Binance, Coinbase, you name it**.

¬†

If this is what I think it is, I was right with my last Reddit post about Kendu Inu:¬†**DYOR on this top-tier project BEFORE IT‚ÄôS TOO LATE**. :D

\* Shib OGs are involved.

\* Kendu's dev is friends with the Shib dev.

\* Organic community that avoids gambling, promotes the project themselves while holding long-term (""diamond handing""), working together as one without relying on external support.

\* No paid marketing tactics like pump-and-dump schemes affecting us.

\* Experienced dev managing the project well, with additional focus on work and sentiment.

\* No exchanges are paid to list our coin; they approach us to buy Kendu at market price. Kendu is listed on over 14 exchanges.

\* Despite market downturns, we've grown to over 12,000 holders and continue to grow steadily.

\* In June, Kendu was the top gainer according to Crypto Research (\[[https://x.com/CryptoRResearch/status/1808513629815447683/photo/1\](https://x.com/CryptoRResearch/status/1808513629815447683/photo/1)](https://x.com/CryptoRResearch/status/1808513629815447683/photo/1](https://x.com/CryptoRResearch/status/1808513629815447683/photo/1))), proving our strategy works.

Now is a great time to buy Kendu. After doing your own research (DYOR), there's no reason not to get involved.

Reaching 40-50 billion levels is achievable for Kendu, given strong sentiment and growing interest in the crypto market.

Kendu offers a safe bet with strong conviction for moonshot potential.

When the Lambo burns it‚Äôs going to be insane | POWSCHE set to go viral,16,1ea27rb,altcoin,https://v.redd.it/19pseqo968ed1,27,"I'm just a Reddit community member and I've been dabbling in a few meme coins, I've come across POWSCHE and just wanted to share my thoughts on why I think it will do well. (Nothing too long winded so I will keep it short and let you do your own research).

I just want you to have a think about when POWSCHE sets a Lamborghini Aventador on fire while streaming it live on Twitch‚Ä¶.

To me, this means millions of views as it goes viral worldwide.  Everyone will have heard of POWSCHE at this point and that‚Äôs when the fun will start, people will want to ape in at this point causing POWSCHE to go parabolic.

The aim of the memecoin game is to get as many people involved as possible and POWSCHE will achieve this as everything they have planned is geared up to get more eyes on POWSCHE.

I would get a small or big bag (only invest what you can afford to leave in) - Don't overexpose yourself but I am pretty certain with all that POWSCHE have planned you will regret it if you don't.

Save my post and come back to me in 3 months to let me know if I was correct in my prediction. :-)

Yes, Hege Dev is an animator but that does not means he doesn't know what to do and how to make a great project. He wanted to make a rug-safe memecoin with community full of dedicated holders willing to work in order to make Hege go to places. And as you can see, It has been working out greatly so farüòÅ.

And last but not least, as one of the Hegends in our community promised, he will pay for a flying banner with Hege. This plane flyover will take place in L.A. on Tuesday 23rd July. Stay tuned for the results because there will be pictures of this banner at Hollywood sign or Santa Monica Pier.

My point of view is that we need to start thinking about Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) and diversifying our security methods.

This is probably just my sentiment, but do you think the CrowdStrike incident might impact the crypto industry‚Äôs push for decentralization?

[URGENT] DYOR on this Project Before it's too Late,122,1e8mhth,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1e8mhth/urgent_dyor_on_this_project_before_its_too_late/,60,"Ladies and Gentlemen,

We went through a tough couple of weeks.

The recent events led to BTC dropping as low as¬†**$53K**, causing¬†**fear in the market**¬†and many weak hands to either sell their entire holdings or scale down on their positions at the¬†**worst possible occasion**.

https://preview.redd.it/zb3hafyajvdd1.jpg?width=963&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bea615499825787344eed404f90213cd2fa02847

  
Just as there couldn't be a worse moment to sell your beloved crypto, there wasn't a better time to get a position or top up your bags¬†**at such a discount**.

¬†

When you have your eyes on¬†**good projects with strong fundamentals**, you need to take calculated risks and buy the jeets' bags.

After only 5 days from a moment of ""**Extreme Fear**"", based on the ""**Fear and Greed Index**"", we're now back at a decent level of ""**Greed**"".

https://preview.redd.it/pmhj6nfcjvdd1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e42f279382b2fd59527fb383b61b37b8db6925f1

  
One of the ways to distinguish a good project from a less good one is to pay attention to¬†**how the chart responds**¬†when the market goes up after a dip.

Good projects with strong fundamentals have already¬†**shown signs of a strong reversal**, gaining¬†**50%**,¬†**100%**¬†or even more from the lowest point touched during the market crash.



One of those projects is certainly¬†**$KENDU (Kendu Inu),**¬†which went from as low as¬†**$68M**¬†back to almost¬†**$150M**¬†as soon as the market showed some strength.

¬†

That is an extremely bullish indicator to look for in a project.

https://preview.redd.it/h87d2ntdjvdd1.jpg?width=871&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2288fcc8d9531332c4aef39aacc4c862f4b10593

https://preview.redd.it/gzlpbzpejvdd1.jpg?width=1105&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1ee3b056690d239a32a4d0364037703ce7b87b1f

  
**COMMUNITY SENTIMENT**

Another important thing to look for is¬†**how active the community is during a market crash**.

¬†

**Most ""projects"" go straight to zero or almost in this phase.**¬†People in the TG group go silent, stop raiding, are sad, and eventually start looking around at the next shiny thing.

This never happens at¬†**$KENDU**.

There is such a¬†**big core group of OGs**¬†who are always ready to¬†**work and lead by example**. People coming to the Telegram group are always surprised by the warm welcome and the work ethic of the¬†**$KENDU army**.

**The Kendu Inu community is more active during the dips than most communities are at ATHs.**

You want a¬†**very active community**¬†that is¬†**always positive**¬†about the project and ready to spread the word, especially when all the others around you are¬†**too lazy and depressed**¬†to do so.

https://preview.redd.it/cbf2wjpgjvdd1.jpg?width=1079&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6bb459e0141fb998c9ba991fd2e300793ff1b977

  
**COMMUNITY GROWTH**

**But how fast is this strong Kendu community growing?**

Well, let's look at the data. Data does not lie.

¬†

**The project launched on Feb 21st.**

**May 1st -->**¬†**160**¬†members of the subreddit -¬†**1300**¬†on-chain holders ‚Äì listed on¬†**1 CEX**

**Jun 1st --> 1345**¬†members of the subreddit-¬†**6000**¬†on-chain holders ‚Äì listed on¬†**2 CEXs**

**July 19th -->**¬†**3554**¬†members of the subreddit ‚Äì¬†**12701**¬†on-chain holders ‚Äì listed on¬†**14 CEXs**

https://preview.redd.it/ay6ubk5jjvdd1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=98f10c2f3a8d6be101230fe6095bc25a64c97007

https://preview.redd.it/knuuxqakjvdd1.jpg?width=770&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=20b9cc0eb5139ffa7fe26fc868681ab46510961d



**100% organic**, after a slow start, Kendu Inu has seen exponential growth in the last couple of months.

**Kendu Inu has a very strong floor**¬†thanks to diamond-handed holders with a big vision, a beautiful chart,¬†**holders count growing daily**¬†and good supply distribution where nobody holds more than roughly¬†**2%.**

¬†

**That is the result of a combination of:**

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Fair launch

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Organic growth

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† No supply to KOLs

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† No big influencers calling you from the start and letting jeets form the floor.

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† An army with an extreme work ethic

https://preview.redd.it/7ex1em6ojvdd1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=821eae8a1510fe03977c5d6378c82b233cb4485c

  
**SUPPORTED BY SHYTOSHI KUSAMA¬† - TOP 50 MOST INFLUENTIAL PEOPLE IN CRYPTO ‚Äì**

**Shytoshi Kusama**¬†was included in the list of the¬†**top 50 most influential people in the whole crypto space**¬†earlier this year, as he has a huge reputation and a¬†**multi-billion dollar project**¬†under his leadership.

He recently left an interview where he said his goal for¬†**SHIB**¬†is to reach¬†**One trillion dollar**¬†market cap ($1000b).

He would never risk any of that to support a project that is either a¬†**scam**¬†or a mere¬†**pump and dump.**

As of today, Kusama has followed the page on X and joined the Telegram group to say hi and ask for details after¬†**$KENDU**¬†went from¬†**$2.8M**¬†to¬†**$60M**¬†market cap in just a few days.



He asked: ""**Why up so much? lol**""



It has also been confirmed that he has been holding a fat bag of¬†**$KENDU**¬†since at least¬†**$1M**¬†market cap.

Even though all details have yet to be revealed, it is known that¬†**$KENDU**¬†will play a role in the Shib ecosystem, which might explain Shytoshi's involvement in Kendu Inu.

Make no mistake, though, Miazaki has always said that¬†**Kendu has its own identity**¬†and will not just be one of the small dogs existing under the SHIB umbrella.

At the same time, being a partner of the 2^(nd)¬†biggest meme coin that ever existed from such an early stage is an extraordinary achievement.

https://preview.redd.it/40n7n95rjvdd1.jpg?width=848&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=50b589b892f9d21e99e0c28b03f2118bdc922d41

  
**COINBASE LIKES THE STOCK**

News from last week:¬†**Coinbase Wallet**¬†showcased¬†**Kendu Inu**¬†in their new video ad (you can find it pinned on their X page)

**$KENDU**¬†is the only meme project displayed there that is not in the multi-billions of market cap.



To be specific, these are the market caps of all the coins/tokens displayed in the video ad (at the time of the video being posted):

**KENDU**: $104 Million  
**USDC**: $33 Billion  
**SOL**: $66 Billion  
**BTC**: $1.2 Trillion  
**ETH**: $371 Billion  
**USDT**: $112 Billion  
**MATIC**: $5.0 Billion  
**PEPE**: $3.7 Billion



The second smallest meme¬†**coin**¬†in the video is¬†$PEPE, which is sitting at¬†$5.1b, about¬†40x¬†from where¬†$KENDU¬†is right now.

**Read between the lines, people.**

The craziest thing about it all is that Dev said he had nothing to do with the Coinbase video ad.

He said ""I wish I could tell you I have buddies at Coinbase, but I don't.¬†**That's because of you guys.**""

**Community-driven**¬†projects focused on¬†**organic growth**¬†are the best.

**BULLISH ARTICLES**

**Cointelegraph article 1**¬†-->¬†**Kendu Inu ‚Äî The one Inu that aims to rule them all**¬†--> This article highlights the organic nature of Kendu Inu and its success in reaching new ATHs while the entire market was dipping.

¬†

**Shib Mag**¬†-->¬†**Kendu: The Wild Card That Could Reshape the Shiba Inu Universe**¬†--> This article highlights that $KENDU is on a mission to forge its own identity and aims at revolutionizing the entire meme coin space.

¬†

**CMC article 1**¬†-->¬†**6 Best Altcoins to Buy Now**¬†--> Coinmarketcap puts $KENDU as the n.1 altcoin to buy among the ones in the article.

¬†

**CMC article 2**¬†-->¬†**Top 4 Altcoins With Upward Breakout Potential**¬†--> Coinmarketcap puts $KENDU as the n.2 altcoin with breakout potential, after KASPA.

**CryptoResearch**¬†-->¬†**Top 10 Gainers in June 2024**¬†--> Kendu Inu takes the first spot as the #1 gainer for the month of June¬†**(177.5%),**¬†beating other fast-growing projects such as BRETT (**72.8%**), POPCAT (**57.3%**), and KASPA (**39%**).

¬†

**\*\*I'm not sure Reddit is going to like too many links in the same post, so I'll avoid linking them. You can either ask me or google the name of the article and you will find them.\*\***

**KENDU CHADS IS 99% COMPLETE**

Miazaki has always referred to Kendu as an¬†**ecosystem**, it's always been part of the name of the TG group even. He says the¬†**Kendu Inu Ecosystem**¬†**will be the biggest in DeFi**, meaning there are big plans for Kendu in these coming months.

¬†

Kendu Inu's first¬†**dAPP**¬†is about to be released to the public.

**Kendu Chads**¬†is not the final boss, it is only¬†**the first piece of a big puzzle**.

Kendu Miazaki has left hints about what that may or may not be throughout the weeks.

¬†

**What we do know about Kendu Chads to date, is:**

* You need at least¬†**5M**¬†tokens to participate
* It is not staking
* You can earn¬†**ETH**¬†with it

¬†

There are no (and never will be) ""**sell the news**"" events at¬†**Kendu Inu**. Therefore, details about Kendu will only be known once the¬†**dApp**¬†is out and ready to be used.

¬†

Even though Miazaki is an ""alpha vault"" (meaning he does not release info on the future on Kendu beforehand; he creates and then tells you what it is once it's done), he's hinted at the fact that¬†**the goal is for Kendu to last for a long time, definitely more than a cycle**.

He once responded positively to a question from someone asking him if Kendu was supposed to maintain his value during a bear market.

https://preview.redd.it/s5ix9mfxjvdd1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b1d565ff999ee91ed8b967f58354113a219af522

  
**WHERE IS THE MARKET HEADED?**

It is clear that the cycle is, so far, repeating itself.

**There is no better entry than now**¬†if you want to get into a project. Take a look at the picture below (right side) and see where we currently stand:

**On the final dip that usually precedes the start of the real bull run.**

We had the¬†**BTC ETF**¬†come out in January, and we have the¬†**ETH ETF**¬†going live just a few days from now.

**Rate cuts are planned for Q4**, and that, combined with the expected result of the¬†**US elections**, should signal the start of the most fun part of the¬†**bull run**.

There is going to be so much money flowing into the space.

Every project that is not a scam and has done well these past few months will inevitably do well in the coming bull run.

And when there is so much greed in the air that every shitcoin is in the green, what do you think is going to happen to such a strong project like¬†[$KENDU](https://x.com/search?q=%24KENDU&src=cashtag_click)?

""Multi billions is not the goal. It is my standard"" - Kendu Miazaki.

POWSCHE | Something you can be proud of holding (volume up),22,1e4mn6o,altcoin,https://v.redd.it/w3qam823dvcd1,19,"POWSCHE is making a massive impact and I just wanted to share this awesome video with you and talk about some of the highlights on their roadmap: 

**Porsche giveaway at $10 Market cap:** Not only will this be amazing for the community member who wins this but it‚Äôs great publicity and it‚Äôs a sure way.

**Tesla giveaway to a single mother at $50m market cap:** What an amazing thing to do, reliable transportation can make a huge difference in their lives, providing better access to jobs, education, and essential services.

**Burning a Tesla at $50m market cap:** This is going to be an epic event and has got viral written all over it.   It‚Äôs a way for POWSCHE to start reaching an audience that might not necessarily be into Crypto.  It will bring in a lot of eyes and get the attention of many people.  

**Burning a Lamborghini $100m market cap:** If you haven‚Äôt heard about POWSCHE by now you will do after the Lambo burn.  POWSCHE is planning on burning the Lamborghini Aventador streamed live for the world to see.   

Again, like the Tesla burn this will be an epic event, there will be a Porsche GT3 RS drifting around it, full production crew with members of the community cheering on the sidelines.  

Imagine how viral the Lambo burn event will be, both social and more traditional media channels will all pick up on this, this is a sure way to make sure that everyone is talking about POWSCHE, this will send the coin to another level, millions of views and it will be a historic crypto event. 

**Porsche 911 GT3 RS giveaway:** So if that wasn‚Äôt enough, the Porsche 911 GT3 giveaway is insane.  

I don‚Äôt even have to say more about this apart from, if you are a holder and have made it to this mark, you deserve to be entered into this giveaway for being a proper chad.

For me POWSCHE sticks out, miles apart from any other coin in the space.   

Everything they have planned helps attract new investors at every milestones.

Other coins lack this in my opinion, they might make it so far but how are they going to attract others outside of the crypto space?

My experience as a community member at POWSCHE has really been eye opening as the team are relentless in terms of innovating and most importantly the Dev has proven himself that he wants to create a legacy coin and take the community with him.¬† 

The Dev personally had $3.5 million in his wallet when POWSCHE hit it‚Äôs all time high and didn‚Äôt sell a dime.¬† This spoke volumes to me, it‚Äôs difficult to find a Dev in this space with this sort of integrity.¬†

There is going to be plenty of marketing coming up and POWSCHE has a detailed roadmap, Porsche giveaways, Tesla and Lambo burns which will go viral and thousands of new investors in. ¬† They are also giving away a Tesla to a single mother which is awesome.

Check out https://www.powsche.com/ for full details on the Roadmap.

POWSCHE burning a Tesla and Lambo | Get in before it goes viral,10,1e3rg2f,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1e3rg2f/powsche_burning_a_tesla_and_lambo_get_in_before/,18,"https://preview.redd.it/3voh110htncd1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e8e942c2e02b9118303a833a57c7518bc54c818d

Hey Crypto Peeps!

POWSCHE will host two separate live events on Twitch, the first one at $50 million Market Cap will be the Tesla burn, the second at $100 million dollars will be an actual Lamboghini Aventador, they are getting a Porsche 911 to drift around the burns to make it even more epic.¬†¬†

*‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt just a stunt, it‚Äôs a statement of intent and innovation in the memecoin space‚Äù*¬†

**Here‚Äôs why I think it‚Äôs going to change the game:**¬†

Memecoin history - No memecoin has ever attempted anything like this before.¬† POWSCHE is setting a new benchmark for creativity in the crypto world.

Massive publicity - Both events are guaranteed to attract significant attention from both the crypto world, mainstream and social media.¬† Imagine the headlines and social media buzz.¬† POWSCHE will be what everyone is talking about. ¬† Both events will go viral, this will bring in so many non-crypto people.

Live engagement - Streaming live on Twitch will ensure real-time engagement, thousands of viewers, millions of streams afterwards across all social media platforms. ¬† This is going to create a lot of excitement and community participation.¬†

**Impact on POWSCHE‚Äôs price**

Both the Tesla and Lambo burns are going to have several positive effects on POWSCHE‚Äôs market dynamics:¬†

Increased Demand - The hype and publicity surrounding these burning events is going to drive a surge in demand for POWSCHE as new investors look to get into the action and not miss out on the next big thing.

Price appreciation - As demand increased and more investors come over to POWSCHE, the increased buying pressure will drive up the price, leading to massive gains for early investors.¬†

**Why does this set POWSCHE apart from any other coin?**

Innovation - The burn events demonstrate POWSCHE‚Äôs commitment to innovate and push the boundaries of what's possible in the memecoin space. ¬† These burns are a signal that POWSCHE is a leader with amazing marketing strategies.¬†

Engagement - By hosting such, let‚Äôs say, epic and dramatic events, POWSCHE is creating excitement and participation within the community. ¬† It‚Äôs not just a ‚Äúhold the coin‚Äù, it‚Äôs creating history and some would say, a revolutionary movement.¬†

My advice is not to wait for these events, be an early investor, when POWSCHE burn the Tesla and Lamboghini I predict that it‚Äôs going to send POWSCHE parabolic.¬† It‚Äôs going to bring millions of people to POWSCHE, traditional and social media will be all over this.¬†

Follow POWSCHE in their Telegram, buy POWSCHE and be involved in the burns which are set to not only set the cars on fire, but the entire memecoin space.¬†

-It's the only coin that is blessed by shib roots which gets a high quality endorsement on trust (Has been on shib mag, Can be verified that shib dev is following our project on x(twitter) and has been in our telegram chat logs can be researched up there)

-Shib og's are in it

-Kendu's dev is friends with the shib dev

-Organic community that doesn't gamble and works towards it by promoting it themselfs while diamond handing, they work for the coin as one and they don't depend on anyone else to do it. No one is coming to save them, They will save themselves by making it happen not relying on anyone else.

-No paid marketing that's going short us by buying bags pumping and dumping on us

-Dev is experienced and is handling it right with the extras on the side, work and sentiment.

-No exchange is paid to get our coin up, they come to us to buy their kendu and list it, They have to buy at market price if they want kendu. So far it's on 14x+ listing's if i'm not wrong (haven't been keeping up)

-I saw growth of holders even while the whole market is bleeding we're are 12k+ holders and still growing and holding strong. Despite the panic and fud in the market on crypto in general making all alts bleed.

-On june it was the top gainer by crypto research https://x.com/CryptoRResearch/status/1808513629815447683/photo/1 (competence proof that what KENDU is doing is working)

Great time to buy some kendu. If you DYOR right, there is just no reason why you shouldn't get in.

40-50b levels is cake play for kendu to make it as the sentiment is at 100B+ plus all the alpha in the background and new money coming in the crypto market.

Good luck in trying to find a coin that is better than it, there just isn't. This is as safe as it gets on a moon shot conviction play.

This creative innovation has led to a massive accumulation of $TON which has seen the token rise from $2.5 to $7.4.

Similar to the rise of Solanameme, Ton is trekking in the same direction but I wonder if it could outperform Solana. With the introduction of the first Ton Dog meme (DOGS Point), many wonder if it could outperform $BONK over 27k % gain. Considering the fact that $DOGS was airdropped to telegram users based on age of their account, many analysts are skeptical it could attain that height but don‚Äôt forget the success of $NOT which promises nothing but did a huge airdrop to users.

I wonder if Bitget and Gateio adding DOGS to their Pre-market Trading means anything but since DOGS image is inspired by Spotty, a mascot created by TON founder Pavel Durov for the Telegram community we could be on for something big.

**We are still so early in the game.**

¬†

Not only is the cycle repeating itself, but we also have catalysts we didn't have in the past.

We had the **BTC ETF** come out on January, and we have the **ETH ETF** going live in just a few days from now.

**Rate cuts** are planned for **Q4,** and that, combined with the **US elections,** should signal the start of the most fun part of the bull run.

There is going to be so much money flowing into the space. **You jeets are not ready for what's coming.**

Every project that is not a scam and has done well these past few months will inevitably do well in the coming bull run.

And flash news from less than 24h ago: **Coinbase Wallet** showcased **Kendu Inu** in their new video ad.

**$KENDU** is literally the only token displayed there that is not in the multi-billions of market cap.

Something to add to that is we are in a nice period of consolidation and supply redistribution from whales to smaller holders.

The market cap is currently around **35-40%** of what it was at the **ATH** a few weeks back, and this is honestly a great entry.

**$KENDU is a good project in a space filled with shitcoins and rugpulls**. 

Now, you have the opportunity to buy or top up your bags at a great price that will most likely not last long.

An Introspective look on Dogecoin's future: $86 DOGE?,0,1e1k3xb,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1e1k3xb/an_introspective_look_on_dogecoins_future_86_doge/,1,"The valuation model is constructed around these main variables:

* Total Value of Products and Services (TVPS): This metric assesses the aggregate value of all goods and services that can be purchased with the currency, providing a direct measure of its economic utility.
* Stock to Flow Ratio (SFR): Calculated as the ratio of total supply to new supply, this metric provides an insight into the currency‚Äôs scarcity.
* Total Supply: Represents the aggregate number of currency units currently in circulation.
* New Supply: Fixed annual increase in total supply, adding predictability to the currency's inflation rate.
* Velocity of Money (VOM): Measures the frequency at which each currency unit is used for transactions within a specified timeframe, indicating the liquidity and economic activity of the currency.

The Formula:Coin Value = (TVPS / (Total Supply \* VOM) \* SFRThe Total Value of Products and Services (TVPS) is a crucial metric in determining the value of a coin, especially in frameworks where the coin is used as a medium of exchange within a specific economy or ecosystem. Here‚Äôs how it significantly impacts the coin's value:

1. Direct Measure of Economic Utility: TVPS represents the aggregate value of all goods and services that can be bought using the coin over a certain period, usually a year. This measure reflects the economic utility of the coin‚Äîhow useful it is for actual transactions. A higher TVPS indicates that the coin is widely accepted and used, thereby increasing its practical value.
2. Basis for Demand: The more goods and services a coin can buy, the higher the demand for that coin might be. If a coin is the only or primary means of purchasing significant services and products, its necessity and thus its value would likely increase as more users adopt it for daily transactions.
3. Indicator of Stability and Growth: An increasing TVPS suggests that the economy or ecosystem around the coin is growing. Stability in TVPS or consistent growth can signal to investors and users that the coin is a reliable store of value, potentially driving up its price due to increased confidence.
4. Pricing Mechanism: In a market where multiple currencies (digital or fiat) compete, the TVPS can serve as a crucial differentiator. It helps in pricing the coin relative to others by showcasing its purchasing power parity within its operational ecosystem. If a coin can purchase more or higher-value services and goods compared to another, it can be perceived as having a higher inherent value.
5. Feedback Loop for Development: A robust TVPS can encourage further investments into the services and products priced in the coin. This, in turn, can create a positive feedback loop where increased utility leads to higher demand, which then drives further economic activities denominated in the coin.

In sum, TVPS is not just a reflection of the coin‚Äôs current worth but also a forward-looking indicator that can influence investor behavior, user adoption, and overall market dynamics surrounding the coin. By effectively measuring and potentially increasing the TVPS, stakeholders can strategically enhance the perceived and real value of the coin within its operating environment. The Velocity of Money is a critical economic indicator in assessing the value of a coin, especially in systems where the coin functions as an active medium of exchange. Here's a detailed look at how the velocity of money impacts a coin's value:

1. Measurement of Economic Activity: Velocity of money refers to the rate at which money is exchanged from one transaction to another and measures how frequently a unit of currency is used to purchase goods and services within a given time period. High velocity indicates a high level of economic activity, as the currency is quickly changing hands, suggesting strong demand and usage.
2. Influence on Supply and Demand Dynamics: In a cryptocurrency or any monetary system, if the velocity of the currency is high, it implies that each unit of currency is being used repeatedly to facilitate transactions. This can effectively increase the supply of money in circulation without physically increasing the total supply, impacting inflation and the purchasing power of the currency.
3. Indicator of Economic Health and Confidence: A higher velocity of money typically signifies a healthy, active economy where confidence in the stability and utility of the currency is strong. People are more likely to spend the currency rather than hold onto it, which can support a higher valuation as it reflects trust and utility in the medium of exchange.
4. Relationship with Price Levels: According to the equation of exchange in economics, MV=PQ (where M is the money supply, V is the velocity of money, P is the price level, and Q is the output of goods and services), an increase in the velocity of money, assuming a constant money supply, can lead to higher price levels. This relation can also influence the value of the coin, as changes in price levels (inflation or deflation) directly affect how much the coin is worth in terms of purchasing power.

In summary, the velocity of money is a multifaceted indicator that not only reflects the current state of an economy or a specific currency‚Äôs ecosystem but also actively influences the perceived and intrinsic value of the coin through its effects on economic activity, supply-demand balances, and inflationary pressures. Understanding and strategically managing this velocity can be key to enhancing a currency‚Äôs value and stability.The Stock to Flow Ratio is a significant metric, particularly in the context of commodities like gold and silver, and has been adapted to assess the value of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. The SFR measures the scarcity of a particular asset and is calculated by dividing the total stock (existing supply) by the flow (annual production rate). Here‚Äôs how it plays a crucial role in determining a coin's value:

1. Measure of Scarcity: The SFR directly quantifies the scarcity of an asset. A higher ratio indicates that the asset is less readily available relative to its production, suggesting greater scarcity. For cryptocurrencies, a high SFR implies that new coins are being added to the total supply at a slow rate compared to the existing stock, which can enhance the perception of the coin as a scarce resource.
2. Indicator of Value Over Time: Historically, assets with higher SFR (like gold and silver) have maintained their value over long periods due to their scarcity and lower rates of supply expansion. In cryptocurrencies, a rising S2F ratio over time can signal that the coin is becoming increasingly scarce, potentially driving up its value if demand remains steady or increases.
3. Influence on Investor Perception: Investors often view assets with high SFR as ""harder"" assets. In the realm of cryptocurrencies, a high SFR can attract investors looking for assets that are less susceptible to inflation or dilution, much like traditional store-of-value assets such as gold.
4. Predictive Power for Future Prices: Some models, particularly those applied to Bitcoin, have used the SFR to predict future price increases. These models assume that as the production rate decreases (typically through mechanisms like halving events in Bitcoin), the reduced flow relative to the existing stock will drive up prices.
5. Comparison Across Assets: The SFR model allows for a comparison between different assets based on their scarcity. This can be particularly useful in the cryptocurrency market, where different coins have different issuance schedules and caps, affecting their SFR and, consequently, their perceived long-term value.

In summary, the Stock to Flow ratio is a crucial metric for assessing the scarcity and potential long-term value of a coin. It provides a quantitative foundation that helps investors and analysts understand how the rarity of an asset relates to its market value and helps predict how its price may evolve based on changes in supply dynamics. This makes SFR a valuable tool for strategic investment decisions in both commodity markets and the growing field of digital currencies.

# Data and Analysis

For this analysis, we are only using Tesla's total revenue from all its products and services, including the hypothetical addition of robotics and expanded licensing of Full Self-Driving technology, amounts to $250 billion. This figure will serve as the Total Value of Products and Services (TVPS) in our model to estimate the value of a hypothetical digital coin associated with Tesla. Parameters for the Coin Valuation Model:

* Total Value of Products and Services: $250 billion
* Total Supply: 144.33 billion coins
* Velocity of Money: 0.02
* New Annual Supply: 5.256 billion coins

SFR = Total Supply / New Annual Supply = 27.45Base Coin Value = TVPS / (Total Supply \* VOM) = $86.61Coin Value = Base Value \* SFR = $2,377.65This derived coin value reflects the combined economic utility and scarcity of the coin within this modeled framework. It illustrates how significant the scale of Tesla‚Äôs operations could potentially influence the value of a digital currency linked to its economic activities and scarcity dynamics. This model provides a theoretical financial metric that can help in understanding the impact of corporate revenue and production strategies on associated digital assets.

# Discussion

In this study, we utilized a composite model integrating traditional economic indicators with modern financial metrics specific to digital currencies to derive the value of a hypothetical coin associated with Tesla's economic activities. The Stock to Flow Ratio is instrumental in differentiating this model from traditional fiat currency models, such as those used for the [$USD](https://x.com/search?q=%24USD&src=cashtag_click). Unlike fiat currencies, which are typically inflationary due to their increasing supply, the modeled digital coin has a predefined supply growth rate, leading to an increasing SFR over time. This increment in the SFR indicates a decreasing rate at which new coins are added relative to the existing supply, enhancing the coin's scarcity and potential value. In contrast to fiat currencies like the USD, which lose purchasing power over time due to inflationary pressures and policy-driven supply increases, a digital currency with a high and increasing SFR is designed to gain purchasing power. This is primarily due to its comparative scarcity and reduced rate of new supply introduction, which, ceteris paribus, should lead to an appreciation in value if demand remains constant or grows. The mechanism here is akin to that of precious metals like gold, which have historically served as hedges against inflation. This model suggests that digital currencies with increasing SFR could command a premium in the financial markets. Investors might view such currencies as safer stores of value over the long term, particularly in economic environments where traditional currencies are depreciating. The analysis thus highlights the potential of [#Dogecoin](https://x.com/search?q=%23Dogecoin&src=hashtag_click)  to not only serve as effective mediums of exchange but also as robust long-term investments that may outperform inflationary fiat currencies in maintaining purchasing power. The increased Stock to Flow Ratio (SFR) of a digital currency like Dogecoin suggests a growing scarcity and potential appreciation in value over time compared to more inflationary currencies such as the USD. In economic terms, as Dogecoin becomes scarcer and its purchasing power potentially increases, the relative cost of goods and services priced in Dogecoin should logically decrease if these prices are indexed to a currency experiencing inflation, like the [USD.To](http://USD.To) integrate this into pricing strategies, businesses could apply an indexed discount for payments made with Dogecoin, reflecting its expected long-term appreciation. This discount reflects not only the current exchange rate but also the anticipated future value of Dogecoin, thereby incentivizing customers to use the cryptocurrency for transactions. It also compensates for the potential 'opportunity cost' of spending a deflationary currency today rather than holding it. This approach can benefit both consumers and businesses:

* For Consumers: It provides a tangible benefit to using Dogecoin over traditional currencies, potentially saving money due to the currency's appreciation.
* For Businesses: It encourages more transactions in Dogecoin, increasing its circulation and utility as a currency. Moreover, businesses that hold onto Dogecoin received from transactions may benefit from its appreciation.

Transforming Dogecoin from a speculative asset into a functional currency also change the dynamics of its volatility:

* Increased Utility: As Dogecoin transitions to being used more as a currency than an asset, its utility in everyday transactions increases. This widespread use can help stabilize its value as it becomes more integrated into regular economic activities.
* Reduced Speculation: When a cryptocurrency like Dogecoin is primarily used for speculation, its price is highly susceptible to market sentiments and speculative trading. As it shifts towards functioning as a currency, its value becomes more closely tied to its utility and less to investor speculation.
* Market Depth and Liquidity: Increased usage as a currency can enhance market depth and liquidity. This means more buyers and sellers at any given time, which typically reduces price volatility because the market can absorb larger transactions without impacting the price significantly.

# Conclusion

The proposed valuation model for [$Doge](https://x.com/search?q=%24Doge&src=cashtag_click) provides a robust framework that combines principles from traditional hard money systems with modern digital economy analytics. This approach allows for a more grounded and economically justified valuation of digital currencies, which can help stabilize perceptions and foster more informed decision-making in financial markets. The base value of $86.61 for [$Doge](https://x.com/search?q=%24Doge&src=cashtag_click) should be regarded as the logical fundamental value of the coin, given the TVPS. The fundamental value is rarely reflected on open markets that are more driven by human sentiment. Factoring in SFR combined with an increasing TVPS can push the coin value to non-reasonable levels when observed from a fundamental perspective. If Dogecoin provides premium access to General Artificial Intelligence, Self Driving Vehicles and Humanoid Robots, the estimated value of ‚âà$2,500 is too low.

We're not talking about **5,000% overnight gains** that translate to a **99.99% loss the next day.** We're talking about projects that grow the best way‚Äî **the slow and organic way.**

**Multiple factors determine the quality of a meme coin:** Name (+ticker), Theme of the coin, Content, Leading team (developer + team), and the most vital component‚Äî community. **And $HEGE has it all!**

**Name‚Äî** I mean, how can you not love the name ""Hege""? Short, simple, and insanely catchy. **You'll remember it, whether willingly or not!**

**Theme of the coin‚Äî** Determines how easy it is to market the coin and make memes for it; and low-hanging Hege the hedgehog is one heck of a theme! Slap Hege on anything, and you basically have a funny, attention-grabbing meme. The ideas are limitless.

**Content‚Äî** I strongly believe that Hege has reached a level where its content is better than its most similar project content-wise - Ponke's. Animations (especially Chapter 4) and memes are only getting better and more professional. **Maybe we will make an animated movie at a certain Market cap!**

**Leading team‚Äî** May the results and their work speak for themselves; **They know how to manage.** Constant giveaways, constant competitions where the most active and creative members have a chance to **EARN while working for their bags**, constant new animations and memes. We're even having a $1,000 Riddle Giveaway (for additional information head over to our official X account) that is ending today, so take a chance with your detective skills, it would be worth it! **Alongside mentioned, team is dedicated and working on technical stuff as well - CEX Listings, partnerships and similair.** So far they've done a great job (4 CEX Listings, PAAL partnership, and more).

**Community‚Äî** I'm not overexaggerating when I say that the Hege community is the healthiest community out there. It feels nice being a part of something that doesn't hate or bring down others, but is focused ONLY on positive energy and building itself up. **We're united and hardworking, which is why you've seen us a million times, and why you'll KEEP SEEING US.**

**Community proved the legitimacy of the project by raising a $120,000 in a record time!** The money raised will be used for a BIG CEX listing (last time we were pleasantly surprised and got listed on not 3 but 4 CEXs!). **In addition to the mentioned $120,000, we have a marketing wallet with $90,000 in it.**

We're having a **$HEGE MANIA** week where we'll be deploying a full-out marketing push (we got funds for some **serious** exposure!) that will follow a BIG CEX listing (or listings!). And the fun thing is, Hege Mania starts **TODAY!**

I've said it before, and I'll say it again. There's no project like Hege.

We've got everything it takes for a billion-dollar Market cap, and all we need is a bit of luck. **With our hard work, we're placing ourselves in a position where luck will easily find us!**

An insanely fun week, or rather a conquest, full of action and events, lies ahead for every $HEGE holder.

**Why watch from the sidelines? Join us on our journey to the number one spot.**

You'll surely be rewarded for it!

KENDU Chads-Utility?!,61,1dxwzmh,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1dxwzmh,29,"https://x.com/KenduInu/status/1809572988834205725 this is the link to the Spaces Developer talk from today.

Many people talk about utility and use cases in certain crypto subs and wanted to give an update on what I believe (yes I know the overwhelming feeling of many: scam, rug, blah blah blah. I did extensive research and reading before I bought in and none of this new stuff was available aside from a couple names. I believed early on that KENDU is going to be built with an ecosystem supporting it) will be a real utility though I am not sure if this counts. Curious to hear other's thoughts? Would this qualify KENDU as an Altcoin for you when this goes live?

Here is what was said: ‚ÄúKENDU chads is almost here‚Ä¶That is going to bring a lot of buy pressure to KENDU in general‚Ä¶cause you need KENDU to participate in earning some cold hard ETH essentially, right.‚Äù This post is aimed at informing those who have heard the name and questioned the legitimacy.

Sharing my moonshot - $MOZ,1,1dwpn68,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1dwpn68/sharing_my_moonshot_moz/,1,"Hey guys, found this project back towards the beginning of the year - Mozaic Finance. 

Basically seems they are bringing the crypto and AI worlds together through  ‚ÄúAI optimized yield farming.‚Äù

They had vaults open for a a month or 2 earlier this year, and were netting CRAZY APY‚Ä¶ like 80% + at around $2M total in the vaults. However, if you look at the chart, you‚Äôll see it‚Äôs pretty messy because shortly thereafter they were hacked.

The hack was from an insider on the team that‚Äôs since been dealt with by authorities from multiple different countries, and the funds were frozen on a few CEX‚Äôs and are actually expected to be returned very soon. They‚Äôre also relaunching their vaults in the coming weeks. 

Just wanted to share here as I‚Äôve gotten tons of value from everyone‚Äôs posts here! I personally just started buying a lot more here recently because of the bullish news on vaults relaunch and teasers that funds will be returned soon. 

The hack really made me question whether I should drop these guys, but I think a team that can bounce back and improve the product after something like that is infinitely more secure.

My take on $kendu,65,1dvkcgt,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1dvkcgt,36,"Let‚Äôs get right to it: I'm a seasoned player in the crypto space, having been active since 2016. I've navigated the ups and downs, forged connections with DeFi whales, VCs, and influencers, and learned one crucial lesson: it‚Äôs not about utility. This cycle, memes are king. Last cycle, NFTs captured the market's imagination because they were accessible. This time, it‚Äôs memes that are outperforming and drawing in retail investors.

Kendu Inu is set to be the star of this cycle. Here's why you should pay attention:

Recent Achievements and Developments:

‚Ä¢ Massive Market Cap Growth: Kendu Inu has surged to a $250M market cap, demonstrating its strong performance and market confidence.

‚Ä¢ Major Media Features: We‚Äôve been featured in Shiba Magazine, highlighting our significant impact and potential. Check out the article here: https://magazine.shib.io/article/665f5604dc89ea0001834eaf?woof=articles-5-edition-27#articles-5-edition-27

‚Ä¢ Innovative Developments: Kendu Chads, a mysterious yet promising dApp where users can earn ETH, is almost complete. Details will be revealed soon.

‚Ä¢ Exponential Holder Growth: We now boast 12k on-chain holders, doubling our numbers in just 25 days, excluding CEX holders.

‚Ä¢ Widespread Exchange Listings: Kendu Inu is listed on 12 exchanges like bitmart, coinex and lbank, tier 1 exchanges coming soon.

‚Ä¢ Product Expansion: Kendu Energy is a reality and will soon be available to the public, adding another layer to our ecosystem.

Why Kendu Inu?

‚Ä¢ Stealth Launch and Fair Distribution: Kendu Inu had a stealth launch with no KOL allocations, backroom deals, or OTC transactions, ensuring a fair start for everyone.

‚Ä¢ Strong Endorsements: Shytoshi Kusama, the project lead for Shiba Inu, followed Kendu from just 300 followers. He‚Äôs a top influencer in crypto, closely connected with our dev, and will play a significant role when market conditions are right.

‚Ä¢ Proven Leadership: Our dev is a multi-millionaire with a track record of running successful projects, the last reaching over $400M. This is his magnum opus, with twice-daily community calls to engage and build with our community.

‚Ä¢ Organic, Dedicated Community: Our community is strong, diverse, and zero-fud. We‚Äôve attracted high-net-worth individuals, an A-list director and actor, DeFi whales, and more. Our supporters are die-hards, some even naming pets Kendu or getting Kendu tattoos. This is true organic growth and dedication.

Why Now is the Perfect Time:

The price has retraced 50% from its all-time high and is now bouncing off support. This is your chance to get in on a project with the potential for exponential growth. We‚Äôre not looking for exit liquidity; we‚Äôre building something monumental.

If you‚Äôre ready to be part of a game-changing movement, join us. Kendu Inu isn‚Äôt just a token; it‚Äôs a revolution. Together, we can make history.

Kendu Inu is the future. Don‚Äôt miss out on the opportunity to be part of this incredible journey.

13 Reasons Why You Should Hold a Fat Bag of $KENDU (Or Get One ASAP) - NFA,86,1dums5l,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1dums5l/13_reasons_why_you_should_hold_a_fat_bag_of_kendu/,58,"https://preview.redd.it/4znedcfcrcad1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=349d39e376eea7ab1f77ba6aa50910706a6ffe9f

  


**1)¬† SHYTOSHI KUSAMA INVOLVED**

**Shiba Inu lead Dev Shytoshi Kusama**, considered among the **top 50** most influential people in the whole crypto space, is confirmed to be following Kendu Inu and holding a bag since at least $1M market cap.

**Kendu Miazaki**, Kendu Inu Dev, is one of his friends, and he made sure to bring Shy in at the right time.

¬†

¬†

**2)¬† HUGE WALLETS APING (MULTIMILLIONAIRES)**

Wallets with **10+ million dollars' worth of ETH** that had been inactive since the last cycle got back to life only to buy Kendu Inu.

It has even been confirmed that a **Middle Eastern Prince** holds a bag.

Other millionaires (and multimillionaires) are confirmed holders and part of the ecosystem as well.

¬†

¬†

**3)¬† KENDU MIAZAKI**

Kendu Inu Dev ""**Miazaki**"" is an unhinged individual always ready to rock & roll.

He is a **SHIB multimillionaire** (his bag was worth 50+ million dollars at ATH IIRC), and that explains the close connection with **Shytoshi** and other **SHIB Ogs** that are now part of Kendu.

Apart from his **incredible work ethic** and **crazy personality**, him being a loaded individual makes the project much easier to trust because one of the most common reasons for projects to fail is broke millionaire-wannabe devs who can't resist the urge of dumping on everybody to make a quick buck.

He recently admitted on a X Spaces that he doesn't even have that big of a bag. He said ""**I‚Äôm maybe top 20, if even that**‚Äù.

He always says he does not do this for money because he already has money. He does this because he likes to ‚Äú**build**‚Äù ¬†and to allow other common people to become ‚Äú**stupid rich**‚Äù.

¬†

¬†

**4)¬† COMMUNITY**

What can I even say about the **Kendu Army**? Everybody knows about it.

With unmatched work ethic and always ready to spread the word, the Kendu Army is what makes Kendu‚Ä¶**KENDU**!

People who join Kendu go from being dirty, tiny-handed jeets to 7.6ft tall, muscular chads with strong and big hands.

You‚Äôre soon taught that success depends on you and to ask yourself, ‚Äú**What can I do for $KENDU?**‚Äù instead of waiting for the team to release the ‚Äú**next big thing**‚Äù and hoping for a pump while doing absolutely nothing to help.

**We‚Äôve got relentless shillers** on any social media known to humanity, people making Kendu **energy drinks**, people managing a Kendu **merch store**, people with Kendu **tattoos**, people smashing plates on their heads in the name of Kendu, and much more.

¬†

**5)¬† ORGANIC GROWTH**

Kendu Inu fully believes in organic growth.

Apart from financing for the first **CEX** listing, so that ‚Äú**normies**‚Äù were able to join the project without having to go through **DeFi** if not tech-savvy enough to avoid being scammed, **Kendu Inu does not pay for any listing, call on Tg, post on X, video on YT or any other thing you can think of**.

All the influencers that talk about Kendu or CEXs that listed us have had to buy supply from the liquidity pool like any other person.

Kendu Miazaki explained this from the very beginning.

‚Äú**It might be slower, but it works**.‚Äù is what he used to say.

**Organic growth allows you to build a strong floor of diamond-handed holders** who fully believe in the project and do not believe in random FUD.

On the other hand, if you build your floor with people sent by influencers, everybody is ready to jeet at the first chance because they‚Äôre just there for a quick buck and do not see the bigger picture.

¬†

¬†

**6)¬† UTILITY AND SHIB ECOSYSTEM**

Even though all details have yet to be revealed, it is known that **$KENDU** will play a role in the Shib ecosystem, which might explain Shytoshi‚Äôs involvement in Kendu Inu.

Make no mistake, though, Miazaki has always said that **Kendu has its own identity** and will not just be one of the small dogs existing under the SHIB umbrella.

One of the first Kendu utilities, named **Kendu Chads**, will be released in the following weeks after being thoroughly tested for months by Miazaki‚Äôs team of developers.

¬†

https://preview.redd.it/iizlff0bqcad1.jpg?width=1195&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6a5643a5c028cd785132e6788480639d6bf2ebb6





**7)¬† THE DOG OF THIS CYCLE**

‚ÄúNever two without three‚Äù.

People love dogs and always will. **DOGE** and **SHIB** were the first two dogs to reach **$10b**+ market cap.

**$KENDU** has everything it needs to be the third this coming bull run.

¬†

¬†

**8)¬†275M MARKET CAP WHEN THE MARKET WAS BLEEDING**

Kendu Inu reached an **ATH** of over **$275M market cap** when the whole crypto market, from BTC to all the shitcoins, was bleeding badly.

**Kendu is your hedge against the market** and will not wait for BTC to reach new ATHs before jumping to $1b market cap and beyond.

With that being said, when the actual bull run starts and all the random shitcoins are in green, what do you think will happen to a **strong project** like Kendu?

Multi billions are programmed.

¬†



**9)¬† BUILT ON ETH**

**Kendu Inu is only on ETH**. Love it or hate it, Ethereum is the king of all chains and sees fewer scams than all the other jeet chains such as SOL and BASE.

Since Kendu Inu is on ETH, and the liquidity pool is paired with ETH (KENDU:ETH), **when ETH goes up in value, so does KENDU**. As simple as that.

The news of the coming **ETH ETF** is super bullish news for all KENDU holders, both **short-term** and **long-term** investors.

¬†



**10)¬† GREAT-LOOKING CHART**

Even CMC, in their recent article, admitted that $KENDU chart looks very good and **on the verge of a breakout** from a pure TA standpoint, and they‚Äôre not aware of all the **alphas** behind the projects and all the future implementations that are going to be unveiled.

So, if you like technical analysis, you will like Kendu Inu chart.

¬†

**11)¬† GOAL: FIRST MEME COIN TO EVER CROSS $100b**

While every other project in the meme sphere tries hard to reach $1b market cap, at Kendu inu, we think that to be an embarrassing goal.

While Miazaki says that **‚Äú$10b is programmed**‚Äù, meaning it is inevitable, the real goal that excites our community is to be the first meme coin ever to cross $100b market cap.

Miazaki‚Äôs bio on Telegram says: ‚Äú**Taking $KENDU to $100 BILLION and beyond!**‚Äù

Many experts expect this to be a ‚Äú**super cycle**‚Äù and even more a ‚Äú**meme super cycle**‚Äù, meaning we expect not only more liquidity to be deployed in the whole crypto space compared to 2021, but also that **meme coins will grab a much bigger % of that liquidity** flowing around compared to last cycle.

**We can then expect new ATHs for well-established projects** such as DOGE and SHIB, and that‚Äôs why, at KENDU, we‚Äôre working towards that $100b MC goal, which will not look as unrealistic at the peak of the bull run as it may does right now.

¬†



**12)¬† LOW MARKET CAP ‚â† MORE GAINS**

Many people have been led to believe that the lower the market cap of a certain token, the better chance of making a 100x or 1000x. That is SO wrong and misleading.

90% or more of the ‚Äúprojects‚Äù, especially when launched on Solana or Base, **are complete scams**. Period.

The other 0.99% are projects created with the best intentions, but that, unfortunately, are going absolutely nowhere.

**Kendu Inu, at this stage, is bulletproof**. It has proved its value to everybody. ‚Äú**We‚Äôre too big to fail**‚Äù is what Miazaki always says.

Kendu is going nowhere but up.

With such ambitious goals, a **100x means reaching about $15b market cap** (at the time of this writing), which is far from being out of reach for Kendu, especially considering we are about to enter what it‚Äôs supposed to be the **biggest cycle ever** (especially for meme coins).

Another thing to keep in mind is that when you invest in **super-low MC projects**, liquidity is so thin that any whale exiting their position leads to a cascade of sales caused by fear, especially since it‚Äôs not uncommon for investors of small projects to hold 5-10% of the total supply.

On bigger projects, instead, since liquidity is way thicker, you can **enter and exit your positions more accurately** without having nightmares about being rugged while asleep.

¬†

https://preview.redd.it/1a4row5fqcad1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0ab676c8aab4bd351620875cf6b919d71522a86a

  


**13) BEAUTIFUL SUPPLY REDISTRIBUTION**

At Kendu Inu, redistribution is ongoing **24/7**. When the market cap goes up, the number of holders goes up. When the market cap goes down, even significantly, the number of holders still goes up!

And that‚Äôs counting on-chain holders only! **With millions of $ of daily volume on CEXs**, God knows how many holders we actually have.



To make money with altcoins, especially memes, you need to understand two things:

1. What a good project is
2. Buy when everybody else is afraid to do it.

Kendu IS a good project.

Now, you have the opportunity to buy or top up your bags at 40% of the ATH.



If you like Kendu, this is the best time to become part of the army. See you on the other side!

POWSCHE Giving Back: A Tesla for a Single Mother,16,1dthhji,altcoin,https://i.redd.it/ykspjbnno2ad1.jpeg,13,"Hey Redditors,

I just came across something amazing and had to share it with you all. POWSCHE, the memecoin based on a Porsche, has pledged to give away a Tesla to a single mother once they hit a 50M market cap. 

This isn‚Äôt just a cool marketing gimmick ‚Äì it‚Äôs a genuinely awesome way to give back to the community.

Single mothers face some tough challenges. Did you know that about 80% of single-parent families in the U.S. are headed by single mothers? And nearly one-third of these families live in poverty. 

These incredible women juggle multiple roles and responsibilities every day, often without a lot of support. Reliable transportation can make a huge difference in their lives, providing better access to jobs, education, and essential services.

Imagine how life-changing this Tesla giveaway will be for the winner.  Teslas are known for their low maintenance and saving costs on fuel.  For a single mother, this could mean fewer worries about car repairs and gas money, and more time and resources to focus on her family and future.

Here‚Äôs why I think this initiative is so awesome:

**Empowerment:** A reliable vehicle can open up new opportunities, from better job prospects to improved access to healthcare and education.

**Support:** This giveaway shows that the crypto community cares about real-world issues and is willing to support those in need.

**Visibility:** It highlights the struggles of single mothers and brings attention to the importance of community support.

Kudos to POWSCHE for this fantastic initiative. It‚Äôs moves like these that make me hopeful about the positive impact crypto can have beyond just financial gains.

Above we have the upcoming AMA with Xanders a well known Shiba Inu developer. KENDU + Shib. This seems like a can't miss.

Additionally, the metrics for KENDU look really solid. Back to stable 4 million volume. With just shy of 12K trackable individual holders on Dexs. Who knows how many holders we have gained from the 13 CEXs that have listed us and bought supply.

TLDR: great metrics and an upcoming X Spaces that I think should not be missed. This is for the people who have not gotten into Kendu and aren't following all information available. This could be a chance to do some easy research.

$DOG is here to stay. It is the No1 memecoin on the No1 blockchain!!!! It‚Äôs that simple.

$DOG was also realised fairly and there were no BS team/VC allocations. AND 100% of the tokens are in circulation so NO UNLOCKS .

I really believe this is a no brainer. Each L1 has a leading memecoin but BITCOIN until now hasn‚Äôt.

Community is still growing here but is huge on X

Mega 10M $DOG Prize giveaway, Sponsored by NHC x Vitto

As of TODAY that‚Äôs around $60,000 US

Good morning Reddit $DOG Army!  


I‚Äôm happy to share with you something that‚Äôs never been done before in the Bitcoin space and the food industry. If we‚Äôre talking mass adoption, we have to do something special not only for our community but also for everyone else who is not part of the $DOG army. We have to reach out, spread awareness, create content, and do it in such a fun way to gain interest from people who are not heavily involved in this space.



The entire purpose of this project has everything we need to spread awareness and more:



	1.	We earn the funds for the treasury, and we don‚Äôt do it with donations.  
(We get a monster budget to promote $DOG on almost every platform you can think of.)

	2.	The community and newcomers actually receive something in return for participating.  
(100k limited edition plushies, with 3 variants: common, uncommon, rare.)

	3.	We will hold contests by having people post their plushies, both influencers and common      participants.  
(Social recognition.)

	4.	NHC will host giveaways, contests, and promotions for their customers and followers.  
(Bringing a whole different crowd to this space.)

	5.	This raises curiosity in future young Bitcoiners (next-gen $DOG army).

	6.	The chances of this being a ponzi scheme are very, very slim. I don‚Äôt think any national brand would dare to ruin their reputation and keep the prize from the winner.

	7.	The prize on the line is huge. We‚Äôre talking about millions of dollars if the winner doesn‚Äôt cash out.

	8.	If people participate and don‚Äôt win, at least they have a piece of $DOG history in their homes, not to mention the rarity aspect of it.

	9.	There‚Äôs so much more, but this right here should help your imagination flow. I will do my best in the coming months to explain what's going on in my head and my vision for $DOG.



Please check out the X link below to understand the mechanics of this $DOG project. Give it a like, repost, and share it with people who would like to have some $DOG but don‚Äôt know how to.

Why POWSCHE is TOP TIER in the Memecoin Universe,7,1dpzvu4,altcoin,https://i.redd.it/54f0qlpu169d1.jpeg,8,"I've been diving into the crypto space for a while now, particularly exploring the chaotic world of memecoins. It feels like a never-ending parade of cats and dogs, some with hats, some without, popping up every single day.

Among this clutter, POWSCHE has stood out as a unique gem. It‚Äôs over 3 months old and has already proven its resilience in this fast-paced memecoin world. 

What really impressed me is the conviction of its holders - some didn‚Äôt sell even when their wallets neared $3.5 million. Here‚Äôs why they have such strong faith:

#### What Sets POWSCHE Apart? 

**1. Engaging Podcasts**  

The POWSCHE podcast is both informative and inspiring, available on Spotify and YouTube. It gives you a clear sense of what POWSCHE and its community aim to achieve.

**2. Interactive Twitter Spaces**  

Mr. POWSCHE, the dev, recently started going live on Twitter Spaces to discuss upcoming plans and answer community questions. He‚Äôs also very active in the Telegram group, often around the clock!

**3. Porsche Lottery Giveaway**  

Simply by holding POWSCHE, you stand a chance to win an actual Porsche. It‚Äôs a fantastic way to give back to the community.

**4. Referral Program**  

Earn POWSCHE by referring others with your unique link. This kind of forward-thinking is exactly what the memecoin space needs.

**5. Structured Leadership Team**  

POWSCHE is run like a business, with dedicated teams for marketing, strategy, and sales. This level of organization is rare in this space.

**6. Leading Industry Experts**  

The team includes top-tier experts in cryptocurrency, investing, and marketing, instilling confidence that POWSCHE is on the right path.

**7. Tesla and Lambo Car Burns**  

Milestones include live-streamed Tesla and Lamborghini burns, which are expected to attract millions of views and new investors.

**8. Tesla Giveaway to a Single Mother**  

A heartwarming initiative to give back to the community in a meaningful way.

**9. Top Tier Community Engagement**  

The POWSCHE community is vibrant and positive, reminiscent of the early GME days. Join the Telegram group and experience it for yourself.

**10. Strong Roadmap**  

With clear goals and innovative plans, POWSCHE is always thinking ahead. Unlike many coins, they have a detailed roadmap.

Buy POWSCHE now while it‚Äôs a great entry.   Sit back, Hold, Know you‚Äôre in safe hands.

KENDU Alpha - breadcrumbs to something sweet,75,1dp3h4b,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1dp3h4b,10,"We know that Miazaki is a real dev with drive, unparalleled skills and a commitment to etch his legacy into the crypto history books. 

He has been leaving bread crumbs for over a month now about the update to the ecosystem called: KENDU Chads

This big drop surely is less than a month away. I curated most sources and breadcrumbs to save you time researching. This is happening with our without you and for some reason Miazaki said have at 'least 1 million KENDU.'

I also added the list of current CEXs with CoinEx just announcing this morning. 

**DO DOs**: do more research, jump in the TG and learn and get a feel,  ask questions, hop on X and check out  @KenduInu and/or @KenduMiazaki, **scroll all pics**

**DON'T DOs**: ask me wen this dropping (one post said 60% completed with no starting reference), ask me what KENDU Chads is exactly, **continue to fade KENDU**

P.S. holder count continues to rise (11.5K)with strong volume (from 3.5 to 4.5 million with not all CEXs yet reporting in our numbers)

P.P.S. we have many eyes on us and everyone wants a piece

I‚Äôve held POWSCHE for 82d 14h 22m - Here's my thoughts,185,1doznkn,altcoin,https://i.redd.it/hi7iqyvjcx8d1.jpeg,26,"My POWSCHE Journey: Why I'm Still Confident Despite the Ups and Downs

I've been holding POWSCHE for 82 days, 14 hours, and 22 minutes as I write this post.

I've watched POWSCHE soar to an all-time high of a $28 million market cap and plunge to $1.9 million. Like anyone, I've had my doubts, especially in the unpredictable memecoin space with all its rug pulls and false promises. But something about POWSCHE keeps my faith strong, and here‚Äôs why:

**1. Trustworthy and Transparent Leadership:**  

The developer, who is incredibly active and open about his past experiences in crypto, marketing, and life in general, had over $3.5 million in his wallet during POWSCHE's peak but didn‚Äôt sell a thing. He's participated in numerous ‚ÄúAsk Me Anything‚Äù podcasts and video chats, openly sharing his vision for POWSCHE and its origins rooted in a love for Porsches. This transparency and commitment from him and other major holders (whales) who have refused to cash out even when they could have become millionaires, speak volumes.

**2. Strong Community Relationships:**  

The POWSCHE community is tightly knit. It's like a circle of close friends‚Äîif we could achieve something spectacular and make a lot of money together, why would anyone sell out their friends to be the only one with millions? This camaraderie is evident in the top 10% of holders and beyond. Together, we can achieve so much more. Even when POWSCHE hits billions, the plan is to DCA (dollar-cost average) out profits as needed, ensuring stability and longevity for the coin.

**3. Organised and Professional Team:**  

The leadership team is structured like a corporation, with heads of departments managing specific areas like memes, videos, and marketing. It‚Äôs refreshing to see this level of organisation. The team consists of experts in their fields who are knowledgeable in the crypto space and always ready to help and advise. If you haven‚Äôt already, check out POWSCHE‚Äôs podcast on YouTube or Spotify‚Äîit‚Äôs pretty amazing and different from anything else out there.
Read more here about the Podcast:

[POWSCHE Podcast - On The Cusp - Episode 5 out now](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/1dkzpo9/powsche_podcast_on_the_cusp_episode_5_out_now/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

**4. Exciting Real-World Initiatives:**  

I haven't even mentioned the Tesla and Lambo burns yet! Both events will be streamed live on Twitch for the world to see, which will undoubtedly attract more attention to POWSCHE. They also host numerous giveaways and have a referral program where you can earn POWSCHE. 
They‚Äôve also announced Porsche giveaways to a lucky holder! Check out https://www.powsche.com/ for the full roadmap.

**5. Long-Term Vision:**  

I genuinely feel I‚Äôve made a good decision with this investment. The memecoin space is highly competitive, but like any successful business, it's the ones that think outside the box, the innovators, the first movers (like the first car-themed memecoin) that truly make an impact and have longevity.

For all these reasons and more, I‚Äôm not worried. No more getting rugged or losing faith in the dev‚Äôs intentions. No more investing in generic cat or dog memecoins. None compare to POWSCHE‚Äôs dev, leadership team, and community.

Porsche, as a car brand, is recognisable, relatable, and aspirational, just like POWSCHE. I'm not chasing short-term gains; I want to be part of something that looks set to become a significant part of crypto history.

For just a couple of Solana, you could be involved too. My advice? Stop chasing pump-and-dump schemes for short-term gains. Get involved in something you can be truly proud of.

Buy POWSCHE now.   Sit back, Hold, Know you‚Äôre in safe hands.

$DOG No1 memecoin on the No1 blockchain BTC,0,1dojfgk,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1dojfgk,1,"$DOG the No1 memecoin on the No1 blockchain BTC

If you haven‚Äôt heard of $DOG, well I‚Äôm here to tell you about it.

Too many memecoins will rug the everyday retail investor.

$DOG which is on Bitcoin, and is already the biggest memecoin on BTC and is growing rapidly. The community here on Reddit r/Doggotothemoon is still small, but over on X it is HUGE. 
@leonidas minted 100B $DOG coins and released them all at once. Yes 100% now in circulation! No VC allocation no marketing team allocation.

$DOG is a true fair memecoin that is destined to explode. The trading volume on the exchanges for $DOG generally is the highest of all the memecoins. @leonidas will not pay listing fees for exchanges yet still the number of exchanges listing $DOG is increasing.

$DOG is now one of the top memecoins and it‚Äôs done it organically with no BS manipulation because $DOG holders believe in it, as they believe in BTC. 
Remember most memecoins now are just done by big teams that churn out multiple memecoins every week and it‚Äôs all in their favour not the retail investor.

Do yourself a favour and buy $DOG now while it‚Äôs cheap. And ffs look how damn cute it is!

Quick Rant with a Side of Shill,44,1dodwpu,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1dodwpu/quick_rant_with_a_side_of_shill/,8,"**Brief Background:**

I have been in crypto since \~2017 when I was messing around with ETH and BTC but had to always jeet to get more drinking money in college.

This past winter I finally started looking at meme coins, after thinking they were the dumbest thing ever and a complete waste of time.

I got into a couple that went nowhere and then got into $KENDU (aped in at $4M MC). I wasn't active in the TG but then finally dove into creating a twitter just to shill. This is where the rant begins.

**Rant:**

Crypto Twitter is one of the worst places on Earth. The amount of bottom of the barrel scum there with KOLs dumping their bags on their followers and only shilling once they get paid a free bag is terrifying.

99%+ of the accounts are just engagement farms, sliding into DMs asking to get paid for promotion or just posting ""GM say it back"".

There is no sense of creating anything with longevity, it is always ""Shill me something under $1M MC"" or ""What's the next narrative"". Don‚Äôt even get me started on the celebrity meta (waste of time)

Don‚Äôt truly know what the point of this rant is, but just wanted to get it off my chest and hear everyone's thoughts. I think at the end of the day KOLs and influencers think they have way too much power and people follow them like sheep¬† and really are just exit liquidity versus wanting to actually build.

**Side of Shill:**

Will try and make this sound as little like a $KENDU bot as possible and won't put this in our main TG to keep the comments somewhat clean lol.

Being in $KENDU and knowing there has been no paid marketing to KOLs or influencers is what I enjoy the most. Growing the community and coin with no support other than what we do organically feels just like a big middle finger to Crypto Twitter that yes, organic can still work.

Would love for you all to check it out.

POWSCHE will burn a Tesla and Lambo Streamed live | What impact will it have on the price of POWSCHE?,9,1doaalc,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1doaalc/powsche_will_burn_a_tesla_and_lambo_streamed_live/,30,"POWSCHE will host two separate live events on KICK, the first one at $50 million Market Cap will be the Tesla burn and the second at $100 million will be an actual Lamborghini Aventador, they are getting a Porsche 911 to wheel spin around the burns to make it even more epic.¬†¬†

‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt just a stunt, it‚Äôs a statement of intent and innovation in the memecoin space‚Äù¬†

# Here‚Äôs why I think it‚Äôs going to change the game:¬†

Memecoin history - No memecoin has ever attempted anything like this before.¬† POWSCHE is setting a new benchmark for creativity in the crypto world.

Massive publicity - Both events are guaranteed to attract significant attention from both the crypto world, mainstream and social media.¬† Imagine the headlines and social media buzz.¬† POWSCHE will be what everyone is talking about.¬†

Live engagement - Streaming live on KICK ensures real-time engagement, thousands of viewers, and millions of streams afterwards across all social media platforms. ¬† This is going to create a lot of excitement and community participation.¬†

POWSCHE will burn a Tesla and Lambo live on KICK - what impact will it have on the price of POWSCHE?

# Impact on POWSCHE‚Äôs price

Both the Tesla and Lambo burns are going to have several positive effects on POWSCHE‚Äôs market dynamics:¬†

Increased Demand - The hype and publicity surrounding these burning events is going to drive a surge in demand for POWSCHE as new investors look to get into the action and not miss out on the next big thing.

Scarcity effect - Burning high-value assets like a Tesla and Lamborghini highlights the concept of value and scarcity, reinforcing the exclusivity of POWSCHE, just like Porsche.¬†

Price appreciation - As demand increased and more investors come over to POWSCHE, the increased buying pressure will drive up the price, leading to massive gains for early investors.¬†

# Why this sets POWSCHE apart from any other coin.

Innovation - The burn events demonstrate POWSCHE‚Äôs commitment to innovate and push the boundaries of what's possible in the memecoin space. ¬† These burns are a signal that POWSCHE is a leader with amazing marketing strategies.¬†

Engagement - By hosting such, let‚Äôs say, epic and dramatic events, POWSCHE is creating excitement and participation within the community. ¬† It‚Äôs not just a ‚Äúhold the coin‚Äù, it‚Äôs creating history and some would say, a revolutionary movement.¬†

My advice is not to wait for these events, be an early investor, when POWSCHE burn the Tesla and Lamborghini I predict that it‚Äôs going to send POWSCHE parabolic.¬† It‚Äôs going to bring millions of people to POWSCHE, traditional and social media will be all over this.¬†

# Join POWSCHE in their Telegram.

Buy POWSCHE and be involved in the burns which are set to not only set the cars on fire, but the entire memecoin space.¬†¬†

$HEGE is getting listed on 5 exchanges!! This might be your last chance to buy before 100M,115,1do6ivt,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1do6ivt/hege_is_getting_listed_on_5_exchanges_this_might/,110,"$HEGE has been launched 2,5 months ago and since then, it has been doing great. The growth we have seen in the last 2 weeks is extremely impressive considering the fact we achieved this organically. And it is not only the market cap we should look at, we gained new holders, followers, community members etc. So, let's take a look at the recent growth first.

**Market cap**

This flabbergasting pump started exactly 14 days ago when $HEGE was at 2,8M market cap. In the first week, $HEGE exploded for the first time and went to the new ATH of 11M. In the second week, we exploded again and went to new ATH again which is 30,8M and now we are sitting at 25M waiting for another pump that will most likely occur after our CEX listings.

**Holders**

We had 5100 holders exactly 14 days ago after our month consolidation. Obviously the mcap growth will be reflected in the amount of new holders. We have acquired 2500 new holders. This means we are up by 50% in terms of holders and have around 7250 holders rn.

**Socials growth**

Social networks like Twitter, Reddit, Instagram, Tiktok, etc. are often ignored and that is a terrible mistake. But $HEGE admins know that so they spent a lot of time and effort to build them in the last 2 weeks.

We gained over 5k Twitter followers, created a Tiktok account, started growing Instagram and reached nearly 800 reddit members. The most impresive is probably our Telegram channel that absolutely exploded in members and went from sub 3k to 5200 in just 14 days.

# CEX listings

But that's enough about our achievements, let's talk about the upcoming CEX listings. As you can tell from the title, we are getting listed on 5 exchanges. THAT'S RIGHT, 5!!! We got listed on SuperEX today for free and we are going to get listed on Toobit, Azbit and IndoEx later today.

You may be thinking rn, but that's only 4 exchanges? You are right, the best for last. Our admins and dev have made a deal with MEXC, the 11th biggest crypto exchange in the world with $1,5B daily volume. The fundraising with $120k goal started 2 days ago and we were already able to collect over $70k with one early buyer donating over $20k by himself. If we continue in the set trend, we should be able to get all the funds this week and get listed sometime next month.

This shows the faith of our community in this project, willing to send tens of thousands of dollars, because they know this is just the beginning and much more is coming.

The amount of listings we get in only 2 weeks period will catch attention of many people which is great but most importantly the attention of Tier 1 exchanges like Gate, HTX or Bybit and influencers that already started mentioning us after we skyrocketed.

Do not forget that we are only 2,5 months old so there is still plenty of room and time for future growth. I mentioned only the most important things in this post so if you want to find out more about our CEX listings or maybe about the various giveaways our team is holding every week, join our Telegram and become the real HEGEND!

Why it matters to be recognisable in the memecoin space,11,1do6bhw,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1do6bhw/why_it_matters_to_be_recognisable_in_the_memecoin/,18,"We all love a cute dog or cat and they can appeal to many, but what makes these coins any different to each other? ¬† You see memecoins popping up everyday and it‚Äôs this dog or this cat, one with a hat, one without, these are all great and I am sure some may even do well, but i‚Äôm not sure if they are starting to lack originality?¬† Please share your thoughts in the comments about this‚Ä¶.

That‚Äôs why when I came across POWSCHE, I thought to myself, this is different, this is original and it is very recognisable, memorable and appealing.¬†

Who hasn‚Äôt dreamed of one day owning a car like a Porsche? ¬† You might even prefer Lambos, Ferraris or even a Buggattis, but Porsche has always been respected and appreciated for it‚Äôs unique look and German engineering, it‚Äôs a brand that hasn‚Äôt ever shied away from competing with the other luxury sports cars.¬† It‚Äôs a brand that is prestigious.

So when it comes to being recognised and memorable, it‚Äôs POWSCHE that is going to come out on top, thats what makes me really bullish about POWSCHE, to add to this it‚Äôs the first car coin in Crypto, first to market means a lot, category defining means a lot.¬†

As POWSCHE becomes more known, it will be the choice of many in the general public just due to how relatable it is in the real world, the thought of being able to buy a Porsche with POWSCHE will be really appealing to the masses.

This coupled with the fact that POWSCHE is planning to burn a Tesla followed by a Lambo is going to send POWSCHE viral, bringing millions of eyes to the coin.¬†

The Porsche giveaways are pretty insane too, community members have the chance to win, again, this is sure to go viral bringing even more eyes to POWSCHE.¬†

I‚Äôve invested a couple of Solana in POWSCHE, it‚Äôs a great entry at the moment.¬† I‚Äôll let it sit and won‚Äôt sell any, it has gone up where i‚Äôve been making profit and has gone down a few times where i‚Äôve been making a loss, but I am not worried in the slightest, if anything, I know the Dev and the team are pushing it hard everyday, navigating this space isn‚Äôt easy and you need a strong team and community like there is at POWSCHE.¬†¬†¬†

I‚Äôm still doing some short term trades on a few memecoins, you know the ones that are really hyped up, the Tates and the Trumps etc, all good make a bit but you can‚Äôt leave your money in there too long, none of them last and they are left to rot with the false promises coming through a couple of times in the not so active Telegram groups.¬†¬†

POWSCHE has proven that it is here to stay, the team are relentless around the clock and are always thinking out of the box to attract more attention, they are a blueprint for other memecoins on Solana.¬†

A look into Kendu Inu's growth since it was first released,32,1dmsw6o,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1dmsw6o/a_look_into_kendu_inus_growth_since_it_was_first/,27,"Kendu has been on chain for 4 months now and the growth of the project has been quite impressive given we have stuck to an organic growth model.  I wanted to give people a few different perspectives when looking at how Kendu has grown.  I think it's important to look at not only the actual marketcap growth of the project, but the amount of new holders and also the social media growth that we've seen so far as well.  

**Market Cap Growth**

It took Kendu Inu 11 days to go from launch to 1million mcap.  It took roughly the same amount of time to go from 1million mcap to 10million mcap.

After it hit 10million mcap, there was a consolidation period where it took roughly 2 months to reach that 10m mcap again.  Once it did, it then took only 5 days to go from 10m to 50m.

Once it hit 50m, guess what? Yep, another consolidation period.  Difference is this time it only took 1 month to reach 50m again.  Just like before, once that previous all time high was reached again, we skyrocketed.  It took about 5 days to go from 50m to 250m. 

If you're catching on by now, when we hit 250m we started another consolidation period. That's where we are currently and it's only been less than 2 weeks since we hit 250m.  Given the trends that we've seen before I would expect this consolidation period to take less than a month and when we touch that all time high again at 250m, there's no telling what our new all time high will be.

**Holder Growth**

Obviously the mcap growth will also be reflected in the amount of new holders we have gotten but I still think it's good to know what that aspect of our growth has looked like as well.  

From launch, it took about a month to go from 0 holders to 1000 holders. 

Going from 1000 to 10000 holders only took about 2 1/2 months.

You can just see by the numbers that Kendu is growing in exponential fashion.  Obviously yes there were slower times and faster times during these periods of new holder growth, but the end result cannot be argued.  Something to recognize as well, we celebrated seeing 10000 holders as a really big achievement, but in the grand scheme of things, we are still extremely small.  Shiba Inu has 1.4 million holders.  We are currently at a fraction of that amount and have so so much room to grow still.  

**Reddit Growth**   

I wanted to throw in this growth metric as well because we're all redditors at the end of the day and I think it's important that whatever project you buy into, also has a substantial Reddit community backing it.  I personally don't like to see projects shilled on Reddit, without having any actual presence on Reddit itself.  Seems a little shady to me.

The reddit community was created around mid March 2024.  

It took roughly a month to go from 0 members to 100 members.  

In the same amount of time it went from 100 members to 1000 members.

In the same amount of time again, it went from 1000 members to 3000 members.  

Again, the growth we are seeing is exponential and it's all organic.  You can visit our subreddit and you will see that it is all real people who are all in on Kendu.  You might think, oh well I see other memecoins reach the front pages of the various crypto subreddits and and come to the conclusion that they must be very active on Reddit.  Well unfortunately, upvotes reign supreme on Reddit and it is not difficult at all to pay Reddit marketing accounts to bot a post to the front page.  Pay attention to the comment section and you'll see that Kendu posts are from real people, who have real interests in seeing Kendu grow organically; the difference is very obvious if you pay attention to the content!

**Future**

This post just gives a little insight into how Kendu has grown so far and we're still only 4 months old.  There is so much time and room to grow even larger and it's hard to predict how big we can get, but I guarantee it's going to outperform everyone's expectations.  I implore you to join our subreddit or our telegram to find out more about Kendu before you buy in.  Ask any questions you might have, and you'll have a plethora of people willing to answer.

$HEGE update - Is it still early? ,76,1dmg1vj,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1dmg1vj/hege_update_is_it_still_early/,71,"I made a post about $HEGE yesterday but due to our rapidly quick growth, I have to make another one today to keep you all updated about what is happening in our community and what has changed since yesterday. Fasten your seatbelts because this is going to be a hell of a ride!!

**So, what are the hottest topics in our community right now?**

Competitions and giveaways- There are 3 comps/giveaways running this weekend. Reddit competition, Tiktok competition and Twitter giveaway to celebrate our CEX listings. There are around 150k tokens in prices which is roughly $3,000. Join our Telegram if you want to find out more about them.

CEX listings- Our 3 CEX listings are not anything new and you have probably already heard about them. BUT, admins are already talking with other exchanges about potential listings in the future. Considering our market cap, volume, holders etc. I believe it is definitely CEX from top 15.

Marketing- We all believe in organic marketing, raiding and working for our bags but paid marketing is important if you want to play at a higher level and match coins like PONKE or even PEPE or SHIB. Our dev and admin team know that so they decided to start with paid marketing push next week on the day of our CEX listing.

Hollywood plane- JC, one of our community members, said earlier this week that if we reach 20M market cap by Sunday, he will pay for an airplane with a HEGE banner to fly over HOLLYWOOD sign. And guess what? We did it, JC is now preparing everything for this monumental moment because he is a man of his word.

**Now, let's take a look at our growth in numbers**

* Market cap: 14M > 25M
* Holders: 6800 > 7000
* Telegram members: 4700 > 4900
* Twitter (X) followers: 7200 > 8100
* 1M all-time total impressions on X achieved this week

# Conclusion

As you can see, we are taking this really seriously. Our community is full of diamond handed and hard working people and our hard work is finally paying off. We are reching new ATH every day and creating new floor much higher than the previous one, hundreds of new holders and community members are joining us every day and the best part is that this is just the beginning. We achieved all of this during red market! Solana is still at $130 but we did nearly 2x in the last 24 hours. So if you are tired of being rugged all the time and want to finally buy a promising memecoin with 50x or even bigger potential, buy a bag now because we are going much higher.

And if you want to do more research before buying, go through our website or join our Telegram to see for yourself what we are capable of.

What are the key things to look for/at when determining which alt content invest in?,3,1dm8b1l,altcoin,https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/solana/,3,"The link was added just so my post wouldn‚Äôt be flagged for not having one.

Just for some context:

I‚Äôm very young and can afford risk, roughly 60% of my portfolio is stock (with a fair amount of money in BITU and UPRO) and 40% is crypto. 

Within the crypto I would say 98% of my holdings are bitcoin, I have about $50 in HEGE, $25 in SOL, and $20 in ETH. I would like between 3- 5% of my entire portfolio to be in alt and meme coins.

This post is more asking about alt coins and not meme coins, as most meme coins are based off the community and luck.

But in terms of bigger alt coins, what do you guys look for when choosing to invest in these coins?? (Stocks you‚Äôd look at financials, ceo, eps, ytd performance, sector performance, competition, etc - I‚Äôm trying to see what the equivalent would be for crypto)

Project with the BIGGEST potential in the upcoming Bull-run.,78,1dlwg5f,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1dlwg5f,55,"As crypto is becoming more mainstream, people are more than ever starting to invest in it. That means that now, besides crypto enthusiasts, we have more 'regular' people in the cryptocurrency space.
And as it turns out, 'regular Joes' LOVE Meme coins.

I know that there are crypto projects that are working on 'legit' utilities and real life purposes, but they aren't getting the same action and exposure that Meme coins are getting. It's just the way it is.
Could be a sign that the majority of the cryptocurrency space are now 'Regular Joes', which is not a bad thing (Mass adoption).

With that being said, we can conclude that Meme coins have MASSIVE potential in this upcoming bull run.
And home of the Meme coins is, whether some would like to admit it or not, Solana network. (Fast, secure, and nearly non-existent transaction fees).
Expected rise of the price of Solana in this upcoming bullrun will have a positive 'consequence' - Meme coins on Solana network will grow in price accordingly as well.

In the sea of Meme coin projects in Solana, there is one that stands tall and stand out - our boy $HEGE. ü¶î

$HEGE started out on Reddit, and that is why we rightfully call it Hege's home.

Disclosure wise, I am a presaler on this project (65k MC), and in the moment of writing $HEGE's Market Cap is 16.5 million dollars.
Idea of selling never crossed my mind. Actually, I kept buying and adding to my bag as a firm believer of this project and its community.

In the Meme coin space, community and content (memes) is something that makes or breaks a project, not the other way around. And $HEGE has it all.

Community is strong, united, and most importantly, HEALTHY. You actually feel comfortable and pleased being in the TG groupchat (Our notorious HEGEQUARTERS).
You feel proud and like you're a part of something (Yes, it's possible. Even in this sea of scams and rug-pulls).
Besides TG Group and dedicated channels for different cultures, we got Discord server. Little bit of everything for everyone.

Content and memes part wise, $HEGE has BY FAR the best ones in the game, with all due respect to other projects.
Community and Dev. team is full of graphic designers and creative people, and that is the reason we dominate with the Content and Shilling material (And we'll only be getting better and better!).
Cheap and non-professional AI artwork is not something we do, and what you're used to seeing today.
Mentioned content and memes are then used by our hardworking community members, in relentless raidings we do.

As $HEGE is slowly getting the exposure he truly deserves, we got ourselves 3 CEX listings on the 25th of June.
BIG Marketing push is planned to follow up the CEX listings, which means that fun and exciting times are ahead of us.

It's nice being a part of something where you're not scared that your holdings went down to 0 overnight. We can proudly say we are rug-proof!

Feel free to check out our mentioned HegeQuarters (Telegram group), I'm sure you'll enjoy your stay and meet some wonderful people. We have a 100 Million Market Cap holders party planned out in London!

We're currently having a 500$ Giveaway! Head over to our official X account for more details.

I'll conclude this post with the following message;
Trust me when I say, it's still not too late to become a holder of this undervalued gem!

$HEGE Rocket WILL fly to a Billion dollar Market Cap either way, so you might as well join us on our journey. We'd be glad to have you! ü¶î

Honest rating of memecoins pt. 5 ($HEGE),91,1dlpzkl,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1dlpzkl/honest_rating_of_memecoins_pt_5_hege/,129,"I came across $HEGE few days ago and after joining their Telegram I had to ape in and I am glad I did because it went up by 100% in the last 3 days despite the fact whole market is red and Solana is at $130. But this is just a beginning and a lot more is coming.

**But first, let's take a look at our growth and achievements in the past 7 days:**

**Market cap-** 6M **‚û°Ô∏è** 16M

**Holders-** 5800 ‚û°Ô∏è 6800

**X followers-** 6400 ‚û°Ô∏è 7400

**Telegram members-** 4300 ‚û°Ô∏è 4800

**1M all-time total impressions on X‚úÖ**

**15k donated to the CEX fees wallet‚úÖ**

You see? This shows that this is a real growth caused by the hard work of devs and community.

**But we all buy memecoins based mainly on their future, not their past, so let me just quickly tell you what's coming up and what I like about this project:**

**CEX listings and marketing push-** We are getting listed on 3 CEXs on Tuesday 25th. So from next week, you can easily buy $HEGE from an exchange anywhere in the world, including the US & EU! To help new investors find us, devs are developing a detailed marketing push for the day of listing.

**Competitions and giveaways-** Giveaways are common in memecoin space but $HEGE is a whole different story. Have you ever seen a community member give someone 7k? 7k dollars, not tokens!! Dev also held some giveaways and competitions so the total value of tokes distributed last week was $10k! And there are new ones coming this weekend.

* **Reddit competitions**- You can win up to 30k tokens ($400) for making reddit posts.

* **Twitter giveaway**- $500 will be distributed between 5 lucky people.

* **Tiktok competition**- Rules and prizes will be announced this weekend.

* **Raid to earn**- There are twitter raids happening every day. Most active people will be rewarded with tokens.

**More partnerships coming-** Big people from memecoin industry are starting to notice us. We have been mentioned by Rodney, CryptosRUs, Moneybags Rico and many more. We have also appeared in many big spaces of crypto influencers and other memecoin. That opens the door to bigger people, companies and CEXs. Dev is already cooking something, we don't know what it is yet, but I'm sure it will be HUUUUGE.

**Community commitments-**  

**J C:** ""IF WE HIT 20M THIS WEEK I WILL BUY AN ARIEAL AD FOR A PLANE TO FLY OVER THE HOLLYWOOD SIGN SAYING: SOLANA SUMMER - BUY $HEGE"" 

**Dutch1214:** ‚ÄúIf hege reaches 10mil MC within a month i will tatto hege also LOL‚Äù

If you're searching subreddits for the next big coin of this bull run, stop and join the $HEGE FUND on Solana. And if you still do not feel convinced to buy $HEGE after reading this, join our tg or go through our website or Twitter to see for yourself. I can guarantee you will FOMO in after 5 minutes.

$HEGE Continues to Break ATHs | 3 CEX Listings in 4 Days ,26,1dl8fy4,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1dl8fy4/hege_continues_to_break_aths_3_cex_listings_in_4/,15,"‚û°Ô∏èFrom next week onwards, you can easily buy HEGE from an exchange anywhere in the world, including the United States & Europe!

HegeCoin has experienced steady and consistent growth both fundamentally and in market cap since launch **10 weeks ago. With 6700 holders, 4600 Tg members, 6700 X followers,** HegeCoin is ready to take the next step and list on centralized exchanges.

After looking at many, many different options, HegeCoin has decided to list on TooBit, AzBit, and IndoEx CEXs simultaneously. Announcements on the CEXs have gone out, HEGE marketing by the exchanges have started (and will continue until listing date), and the go live date will be on 6/25 for all 3.

Each CEX has different advantages, so bringing the 3 together offers the best of all worlds. For example, TooBit is the largest of the 3 exchanges with daily spot trading volumes of about $1.3 bln / day whereas IndoEx does not require KYC up to 100 BTC of withdrawals and is available for United States citizens.

With these CEX listings, HegeCoin is excited to bring the only story-driven memecoin in front of the eyes of millions of new users. **Paired with an aggressive marketing campaign that includes KOLs, 2 Spaces calls with >45,000 listeners, giveaways, aggressive X raids, and lots of new content, HegeCoin is primed to continue reaching new all time highs up to and beyond the listing date of 6/25!**

HegeCoin ($HEGE) Skyrocketing,97,1dkb6tl,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1dkb6tl/hegecoin_hege_skyrocketing/,43,"Fueled by a strong grassroots movement, this ""Reddit-born"" coin is seeing remarkable growth. We've broken past our last resistance, and our returns are skyrocketing! New users are flocking in, determined not to miss out like they did with DOGE, SHIB, or WIF. Veteran community members often say HEGE‚Äôs vibe brings back memories of SHIB's early days. 

**Current stats:** 

- **Holders:** \~6,800 

- **Market Cap:** \~$12 million 

The HEGE community is truly outstanding. The passion and commitment here are exceptional. We're in this for the long run, not just a quick gain. The chart clearly indicates we have a solid project with a dedicated holder base ready to propel this to new heights. 

Our developer maintains high transparency, constantly involving the community in decisions. Besides being incredibly talented, they are also a top-notch graphic designer. People feel secure with Hege, and that trust is essential for our success. 

HegeCoin is about enjoying good times with our community, but we also have a roadmap that reveals Hege‚Äôs story, with new chapters unfolding at each market cap milestone. The higher we reach, the more intricate the chapters will be. It‚Äôs a very cool and unique concept.

If you're searching subreddits for the next big coin of this bull run, stop and join the $HEGE FUND on Solana.

Kendu Inu: a ticking timebomb primed to make a massive leg up (x-post from cryptomoonshots),18,1dk56i8,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1dk56i8/kendu_inu_a_ticking_timebomb_primed_to_make_a/,5," Origins

Kendu Inu was fair launched back in February and came onto the scene with the ethos ""we don't gamble, we work"". The slogan essentially meant that the success of Kendu Inu was entirely on the shoulders of the community and did not rely on paid marketing strategies or KOLs; organic growth was key to being successful. The idea behind the project was to take what made Shiba Inu massively successful and turn it up a notch for the anticipated 2024/25 bullrun cycle. There was no coincidence that Shiba Inu's strategy was adopted due to the fact that Kendu Inu's developer (Kendu Miazaki) is an early Shib OG and has connections with many OG Shib members including Shytoshi Kusama himself (lead developer of Shib). This connection with Shytoshi and other Shib OG's was kind of the starting alpha for the project and helped to gain legitimacy for the Kendu Inu project early on. Since then, Kendu Inu has really developed an identity of its own and stands as a fully legitimate independent memecoin.

The Grind

Since February, the community has been absolutely relentless when it comes to promoting Kendu to the masses (some call it shilling but i feel that has a negative connotation lol). I am not exaggerating when I say this grind has been nonstop every single day since February. I genuinely have not seen another community put in anywhere near the amount of work and effort that Kendu members have, to see that their project rises to the top. There are so many unique members that have contributed to the success of Kendu, doing things like creating energy drinks to paying for billboard spaces in times square and everything in between. It would take a whole post of its own to go into detail about the amazing, ridiculous, and honestly unhinged things the Kendu community has achieved up to this point.

The Results (SO FAR)

Thanks to the organic growth model that Kendu Inu has used since its genesis, it just recently passed the 10000 holder threshold. Kendu also has over 2500 subreddit members, 10000 twitter followers, and 8000 telegram members. The current marketcap is hovering around 185m after reaching an ATH of roughly 260m about 5 days ago. To put some context behind those numbers...

All of these increases are from late march to today

Twitter: 1200 to 10000 followers

Reddit: 67 to 2500 members

Telegram: 1450 to 8000

Holders: 1000 to 10000

Marketcap: 6m to 185m

I wish I could supply the charts that show the growth over that time period because you would see that Kendu's growth follows an exponential trend; the domino effect is definitely real and it's happening right now with Kendu.

The Future

Currently Kendu is in a consolidation period where it is shaking out some jeets which strengthens the distribution of tokens to diamond handed chadettes/chads and new holders who are anticipating this next leg up to be massive. It is literally the perfect time to throw some money into Kendu if you haven't already. We are not dumping and also not pumping, we are sideways trending. Most people are too hesitant to put money into a dumping project because they fear they will lose all their money and then you have the opposite crowd who doesn't put money into a pumping project because they fear they are too late. Well right now we're at like the freakin goldilocks stage; not too cold, not too hot, just right. Given the trends that Kendu has seen before, we are primed to break out into another ATH soon.

Obviously nothing is 100% certain. But I, and so many others, just know that Kendu is going to explode again soon and there will be the same crowd of people on the sidelines that wished they had gotten in while the gettin was good. It's essential to understand that with memecoins, community means everything. There simply is no other community as strong and relentless as Kendu's right now. Personally, I treat Kendu's community as my safety net and it has not even come close to failing on me up until this point and I have no doubt it will hold strong for a long time to come. Important to keep in mind that the bigger Kendu gets, the bigger the safety net becomes.

DYOR

If you are not convinced, just come see for yourself. The subreddit is very active and the telegram always has people in it including admins and even the dev himself. Also, listen to old recorded spaces on X and get a better idea of how special Kendu is in the crypto space right now. Ask questions, get involved, work for your bag!

We'll be waiting :)

A synopsis of crow with knife ($CAW) - Why it's worth looking into,81,1djxi6x,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1djxi6x/a_synopsis_of_crow_with_knife_caw_why_its_worth/,36,"crow with knife ($CAW) has huge upside potential in what will be the biggest memecoin season ever this bullrun. 

Memecoins are a dime a dozen at the moment, the market is absurdly oversaturated. Caw is different though, not just because it's actually a famous meme but also because of the following points: 

100% circulating supply since day 1- devs bought in at the same price as everyone else. Contract renounced, code cannot can be altered, no more tokens Mintabie. 

Available on Solana, Base, Cronos, Polygon, and the Binance Smart Chain, as well as 2 centralised exchanges, all from the same supply of 777 trillion tokens total across all chains. Caw-specific bridges make it easy to bridge tokens across chains. 

Currently 48m market cap, about 40%¬†of ATH. Huge liquidity pool, currently 3.8m on cronos. 2.5m-3m of this is owned by VVS (dex on cronos) who has locked it for the next 11 months (was part of an agreement for a token VVS released about a month ago where you could pay with CAW, they would match it with CRO and add to LP and lock for 1 year). Liquidity on other chains continuing to build. 

Ridiculously healthy coin distribution. Of the top 10 wallets - 

Wallet #1 is owned by crypto.com 

Wallet #2 is owned by crypto.com 

Wallet #3 is also owned by crypto.com 

Wallet #4 is the VVS dex LP 

Wallet #5 is a bridge address 

Wallet #7 is the burn wallet 

10.5k holders on cronos, 2.2k on solana, 1.3k on base. Indeterminate number holding via crypto.com app/exchange and bitmart (though crypto.com and their users own around 40% of the supply right now so there are a *lot*. 

Listed on crypto.com and bitmart, another top 10 CEX fundraise is in progress right now and about 65% of the way there. Community has contributed 100% of the listing fees for payments so far as there is no reserved marketing wallet (read: no risk of being dumped on) Currrently $100k raised in just over a week, with another $120k in the treasury from a prior fundraise. This will be a legitimate, tier 1 centralised exchange, not some pump and dump fake volume mill. 

[Verified circulating supply by coinmarketcap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/crow-with-knife/). [On coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/crow-with-knife). Whitelisted in coinbase wallet and on solana dex aggregator Jupiter's strict list (no need to import contract addresses) 

Fanatical, cult-like community across discord, telegram, Twitter, reddit. Every day is a flurry of activity, memes degen humour, inside jokes, shitposting. The discord in particular is an absolute zoo and ridiculously compelling. This is mixed with genuine, wholesome support- rallying behind crows going through hardship like bereavement and donating to those who have been drained by scammers. 

The memes. Dear God the memes. Endless, dizzying, constant memes, not just basic image macros but insane numbers of photoshops, art, gifs, videos, music. Relatable and enjoyed by normies- I had a quote tweet by Ice-T a few days ago which was liked by hundreds of non-crypto users https://twitter.com/FINALLEVEL/status/1801558231547822273?t=lvVej_BCcHfFVCaHg9R8nA&s=19 

Oh yes and the coin is 3 months old as of Saturday 15th.

Will HEGE join the Billionaire boys club? ,89,1djfwlx,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1djfwlx/will_hege_join_the_billionaire_boys_club/,75,"**What is $HEGE?**

Let's keep this short. $HEGE is a Solana coin launched back in April. It was created by a professional animator who was tired of losing money. This is why it outperforms 99,9% of coins in terms of high quality content. During these 2 months, we gained over 4,5k community members and over 6k holders. We created a strong base of our community with people from all walks of life. With a wide range of opinions from different people we are able to progress quickly.¬†

**What we have achieved so far**

So as I already said, we have 4,5k tg members with 30% increase in the last 2 weeks, 6000+ holders with 1000 new holders in the last 7 days. Our Twitter went from 3k to over 6k followers in just 1 week. We are gaining traction everywhere and our recent growth only confirms my statement. Our market cap was only 3M last Tuesday. Yesterday, we reached the new ATH which is now at 9,5M. Current market cap consolidates between 7M and 8M. We have also been invited and appeared in various crypto spaces of crypto influencers and other coins.

**What makes us stand out?**

Well, I don't even know where to start :D. First of all, our content and memes. It is hard to find a coin with no AI pictures but it is one of our rules. We do not want to post AI content, we want to do it all ourselves and make sure everything is high quality and exactly how we want it. Good and high quality memes are crucial to make it to the 100M club and to stay there. Second thing is a bit clich√© but it is true. It's our community. I have bought a lot of coins in my life but I have never seen a community this active at only 8M market cap. They are constantly hyping each other, helping with everything and creating an insane vibe I absolutely love. This shows that we all believe in this project and that we are ready to bring it much higher than where it is right now.

**Future plans and outlooks**

It may look like we've already used all our tricks, but the opposite is true. This all was just the result of constant shilling, raiding and working for our bags in general. The real show starts now. We will appear in a huuuge space of a crypto influencer with 500k followers today, our first CEX listing is coming next week, HEGE Academy and much more content are in the process of making.

If you still do not feel convinced to buy $HEGE after reading this, join our tg or go through our website or Twitter to see for yourself. You can also listen to some of the previous spaces or join today's held by Travladd Crypto, crypto influencer with 500k followers. If you want to find out more, ask questions and I will try to answer them :).

My thoughts on $HEGE. Can we expect comparable growth to PONKE? ,149,1dh8oll,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1dh8oll/my_thoughts_on_hege_can_we_expect_comparable/,328,"I found $HEGE on Reddit last Wednesday while browsing and searching for something to buy. I joined their Telegram, and although it sounds clich√©, their community is great. They welcomed me immediately, answered all my questions, and even apologized for the raid bot muting me. This is the first time I've seen a community this friendly and open.

**But what really makes $HEGE stand out, and why do I believe it is the next big memecoin?**

* **Distribution Better than 100M+ Coins**: If you compare the liquidity pool of $HEGE and the amount of tokens held by the top holder, you can clearly see that nobody has enough tokens to drain the entire LP. This is extremely rare for a 7M market cap memecoin.
* **Content**: This point is crucial because content quality distinguishes good memecoins from the rest. Compare $PONKE with $HEGE. Both coins have high-quality memes and animations with the same virality potential. And let's be honest, good content is what made $PONKE skyrocket.
* **Originality-** People want something new and fresh. And because there are thousands of dogs and cats but $HEGE is the first hedgehog inspired memecoin ever, we are exactly what they need.
* **CEX Listing**: We are getting listed on Toobit next week. Some might argue that this listing won't significantly impact us because Toobit isn't a major exchange, but you have to consider it from another perspective. It demonstrates the dedication and commitment of both the team, which secured the deal with Toobit, and our community, which donated money for listing and market-making fees.
* **$HEGE Academy**: This made me extremely happy when I first saw it. When I started with memecoins, I lost money on many rug pulls and was so frustrated that I wanted to quit. $HEGE Academy will make it much easier for everyone starting from scratch. It will teach you how to buy memecoins, use crypto apps, identify scams, and increase your chances of success in this space.
* **Growth during red market-** It is extremely hard for any altcoins to grow when the rest of the market is dumping but $HEGE community has once again proven its strength and helped with the recent pump through constant shilling on Reddit and Twitter.
* **Competitions-** Admin team organizes competitions quite often. You can win up to $350 for just creating memes, posts or other content used for promoting $HEGE.

Since $HEGE is only at 7M market cap, it is one of the most undervalued gems right now. If you buy $100 worth of $HEGE now, it could be worth over $1.4k at a 100M market cap, which is easily achievable in a proper bull run.

Everyone is welcome in our community, whether you're a holder or not. Join our Telegram to see for yourself what we are capable of and that I was not lying about anything.

Kendu will hit 40-50b this cycle. DYOR - spoon feed,18,1dgyhrt,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1dgyhrt/kendu_will_hit_4050b_this_cycle_dyor_spoon_feed/,21,"
We don't gamble, we work.

Kendu will hit 40-50 billion this cycle, potentially becoming the first meme coin to ever reach the 12-digit mark of 100 billion.

---


I've been advocating for Kendu in various subreddits, suggesting to buy in when its market cap was around 28-50ish. Currently, it's sitting around a 250 million market cap, but I believe there's still significant upside due to our god-tier community and the recent involvement of the Shiba Inu dev / shib magazine.

----


In the past, I've shared methods for verifying information over Twitter. Now, I'll provide a step-by-step guide on how to verify with even more conviction, especially regarding the involvement of the Shiba Inu dev on Telegram. While I believe a Twitter account is sufficient for verifying shib dev follows and supports kendu. 

---

For those seeking further assurance:


Check Telegram Chat Logs: Search for evidence of the Shiba Inu dev's visit in our Telegram group. Look for quotes from a thread post in the Kenduinu subreddit titled ""Shiba Inu - Kendu - It's Being Written.""
Cross-Check Usernames: Right-click on the Shiba Inu dev's name in the chat logs and ensure it matches their username/contact on the main Telegram platform/shib telegram group.



---


By following these steps, you can conduct due diligence and gain more confidence in Kendu's potential.


---
Don't miss out on potential gains. There's still room for Kendu to grow, with a potential for 100-250x from its current 250 million market cap. With the facts checked and given, It is the safest investment in crypto right now for moon gains.

$HEGE has been reaching for previous ATH and here are some reasons why:,37,1dghjh6,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1dghjh6,26,"Why $HEGE is a long-term hold, and not your usual short-term meme project. Time to rotate those profits into $HEGE!

No I'm not chatgpt or a bot so get that out of your system first, random guy who always comes here. 

Now onto it. $HEGE was born as the anti-rug, the anti-scam, a way to gain trust of those who were rugged before, and as a safe haven for those new to memecoins. Due to that same attitude, we work hard to make sure your money is as safe as it can be, well, in a memecoin space that is. From shrimps to whales.

Because of that, we've made long-term plans to develop this project into something that'll last‚Äînot based on a cultural zeitgeist, a fleeting election, a literal photo of an animal‚Äîbut something new. Every bull market will bring new people and with it‚Äînew scammers. $HEGE will be here to help them, to create a community to guide them. $HEGE will be there to make sure your profits from those pump and dumps you got lucky on are safe. Here are things the team and community at $HEGE are doing to make this last:

1. Nobody single person can rug this coin‚Äîour liquidity is high, and no one person has enough. We know, our whales have disclosed and once larger CEX listings come, have volunteered to lock a large portion of their $HEGE (I am one of them).

2. Real utility‚Äîthe $HEGE Academy. While in early stages, the team (current animators, former teachers, and more) are putting together an ""academy"" that will teach newer folks how to identify scams among many other things. As a former teacher, I'll be helping develop the curriculum myself.

3. Roadmaps, marketing debriefs, transparency. Not gonna lie‚Äîwe had a bumpy time earlier. We were about to start a marketing push when a few unlucky things happened. The team, not wanting to waste the $26k the community raised, stopped the marketing and pivoted strategies. Afterward, they published a marketing debrief, admitting what went wrong and how they were going to fix it. As you can see, it worked. We're up 300% since then! This dedication will continue and as we speak, roadmap #2 is being worked on.

4. CEX listings. We are starting small with TooBit, so that we can dip our feet in as a small MC (7.3m now). We have a plan to continue listing on larger CEXs as MC increases, as it seems logical. These listings will increase the base and give more stable volume as time goes on. A blue chip of memes, if you will.

5. Just, the community itself. You've seen us on Reddit. We're relentless, even when times are tough. We don't give up on our investments or your investments. Go on dexscreener and see how many coins have absolutely zero plan‚Äîeven big MCs. It's why you'll see them fade over a very quick time or a slow death. Because they rode a wave and didn't actually care about the coin's development. We aren't that. We have been through a movie-worth of struggles. We don't give up. 


TLDR; buy $HEGE, rotate profits, and get your next 50x because this is a safe investment‚Äîwell, for a memecoin.¬† Find our TG and other socials at hegecoin.com, see our X, and you'll understand the quality we offer.

However I have found a project that lets me sleep soundly at night.   The SOL ticker is $CHEEKS. 

The reason why I am so hype about this coin are a few reasons. 

1. The dev is a doxed high stakes poker player named Rob Kuhn, who has a lot of high net worth friends and contacts that puts him a tier above all the low tier devs looking to scam

(poker profile:  https://pokerdb.thehendonmob.com/player.php?a=r&n=199312)

2. He has spent thousands of his own money for onboarding KOLs, hiring artists, youtubers, paying for CMC, and other cex listings

3.  The community over the past month has grown to 3k in tg organically and over 4k token holders

4.  The meme videos that have been produced are A - tier list of the likings of PONKE and PEPE

5. Dev is always in voice chat, open about the project and has made it known that he is here to promote a safe coin to buy without the fear of being rugged.  

  
The coin has been sitting around a 5mm market cap for about 25 days and I think is primed to break out. 

Per the rules, you will have to do the research yourselves but best place to start would be looking at the official twitter @[CHEEKS\_ON\_SOL](https://x.com/CHEEKS_ON_SOL) and from there find the CA and the TG links.

Whether you are a veteran or a newbie in the ETF scene, Grayscale is a well-known name that inspires confidence. Some sources have suggested that Grayscale is prepped for filing a privacy ETF and they have been considering and monitoring several projects since 2022. Here is the list of assets under consideration:

* 0x (ZRX)
* 1inch (1INCH)
* Apecoin (APE)
* Arweave (AR)
* Axie Infinity (AXS)
* Bancor (BNT)
* BitTorrent (BTT)
* Bora (BORA)
* Iota (IOTA)
* Kava (KAVA)
* Kyber Network Crystal (KNC)
* Loopring (LRC)
* Monero (XMR)
* Near (NEAR)
* Numeraire (NMR)
* [Oasis (ROSE)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/oasis-network/)

While Ethereum itself depends on L2 solutions to implement privacy effectively in its ecosystem, there is no dearth of blockchain protocols that have been working in this field and have achieved various degrees of success. As a pioneer in smart privacy for web3 and AI with privacy-preserving technologies in use,¬†[Oasis](https://oasisprotocol.org/)'s inclusion in the above list is as expected. However, before getting into how or why Oasis / $Rose could feature in Grayscale's plans, it is useful first to examine the makeup of the privacy ETF.

Ed, a well-known persona in the blockchain and crypto and web3 space, and an engaged Oasis community member with 3+ years of experience being embedded across the ecosystem while contributing towards community building, business development, networking, and marketing activities, has put it all together.

Let's start by looking at what type of projects will constitute this ETF.

* Data Privacy Solution Providers
* Cyber Service Providers
* Blockchain-Based Privacy Solutions
* Network & Communication Security Provider
* Privacy-Preserving Protocols

The projects considered also have some eligibility criteria to fulfill before qualifying and we will mention the top 3 here.

First, a substantial portion, if not all, of their revenue has to come from one or more of the categories mentioned above. Second, the projects need to be listed on U.S., non-U.S. developed market or emerging market exchanges. Third, the market cap must equal to or in excess of $250M.

Projects are scored as 'primary' or 'secondary' based on three metrics.

1. Data Privacy Solutions, Cyber Services, or Blockchain Privacy Solutions take priority over other sectors
2. If ALL or just some business operations are aimed at privacy
3. By alignment with GDPR and CCPA regulations

The prominence and priority of Oasis in Grayscale's proposed privacy ETF plans becomes evident based on the above discussion as it firmly falls under the 'primary' category. While the fact remains that quite a few of the projects mentioned above in Grayscale's list have lost relevance, Oasis has gone from strength to strength emerging as a regulatory-compliant solution provider in addition to its confidentiality capabilities.

According to Ed, this is just the tip of the iceberg and there are other reasons too that underline why Oasis / $Rose is well-positioned in Grayscale's proposed privacy ETF.

To note, Grayscale has reiterated its principal investment strategy of avoiding exposure to digital assets directly, and still, $Rose has potentially a significant role to play in the privacy ETF when it comes out. Intrigued? The answer lies in a single entity having effected a huge accumulation of $Rose (approximately $440M) on chain through Coinbase. To deep dive into this,¬†[check out Ed's thread](https://x.com/ECrypto0/status/1800135721648546253)¬†on Twitter (X).

Favorable market sentiments of ETFs aside, Grayscale's backing of the privacy narrative is well-deserved and timely. Oasis has always been privacy-focused in line with its founder, Prof. Dawn Song's expertise in computer security and decentralized confidentiality. In conclusion, the potential is all there for a blockbuster privacy ETF with an MVP role by Oasis, but nothing is concrete yet. Hopefully, we will hear something positive very soon.

Let's discuss in the comments what you like about privacy ETFs, and also what other criteria, metrics, and projects you think would make it more robust and impactful.",2024-06-11 12:00:41,1718125241.0

The game features an in-game corporation system, allowing players to own shares and manage businesses. It also combines RPG and shooter elements with a new skill-based reward structure.

A recent beta test attracted over 3,000 users who played for over 11,000 hours. The next play-to-mint event is scheduled for July.

"I'm 100% sure, I found the next Shiba inu and it's called Kendu inu (I invite you to verify my research, you'll see that it's true)",57,1dc7030,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1dc7030/im_100_sure_i_found_the_next_shiba_inu_and_its/,21,"I stumbled upon this incredible find some time ago, and since then, my confidence in it has only grown. Rumor has it that the Shiba Inu developer is keeping an eye on the project via Twitter. Initially skeptical, I recently confirmed it, and let me tell you, that alone convinced me this project is set to explode.

But don't just take my word for it. Go verify it yourself. Look up shytoshikusama on Twitter; that's the real Shiba Inu developer. Follow them, then check out the official Kendu Inu Twitter at KenduInu. You'll see shytoshikusama does indeed follow it.

Moreover, Miyazaki (kendu founder) has strong ties and is a Shiba Inu OG. Big things are in store for this coin once it hits certain milestones. The Shiba Inu developer even showed up in our Telegram and had a chat with us.

Kendu is featued on shib magazine few days ago, and we've got several top exchanges lined up like Okex, Binance and Kraken.

The projected volume has convinced me that we'll reach Shiba Inu-like levels at market caps of 40-50 billion.

Do yourselves a favor and grab this golden opportunity before you regret it. This coin is poised to skyrocket in the upcoming bull run, making history in investing.

The Kendu Chads community is fantastic, supportive, and welcoming. Their motto, ""We work together, and we don't gamble,"" speaks volumes. Check them out on Reddit and the official Telegram channel.

If you're still on the fence, spend time with the Kendu Chads, and you'll soon realize it's the smart move. If it doesn't resonate with you, then it might not be your thing, and that's okay.

But mark my words, you'll regret missing out when you see it take off. Opportunities like this for easy gains don't come often. Seize it, take action, and you'll reap the rewards.

Consider this a gift‚Äîa golden lottery ticket. It's a privilege to know about it at this early stage compared to where it's headed.

Join us; we're a community, and we're revolutionizing safe investing. We're not gambling; we're building our future together as a family of Chads.

What does this community and investment mean to me? It means greater well-being for myself, my family, and friends. It means being able to help more people in the future.

I'm embarking on the next chapter of my life with Kendu, and I invite you all to join me.

Wishing you all deep blessings.

üöÄüå± ¬°Acabo de Comprar 25 USD de SLOTHANA! üåøü™ô ¬øSostenibilidad y Potencial a Futuro? ¬°Debatamos! üí¨üîç",0,1d8yknb,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1d8yknb/acabo_de_comprar_25_usd_de_slothana/,0,"¬°Hola, comunidad de CryptoTrendTrackers!

Hoy quiero compartir con ustedes una actualizaci√≥n emocionante sobre mi √∫ltima inversi√≥n: he comprado 25 USD en SLOTHANA. Al explorar este proyecto, me ha intrigado su propuesta y el potencial que ofrece, as√≠ que pens√© que ser√≠a una buena idea compartir mis hallazgos y abrir un debate sobre su futuro.

**¬øQu√© es SLOTHANA?**

SLOTHANA es un proyecto relativamente nuevo en el ecosistema de criptomonedas. Su objetivo es combinar la tecnolog√≠a blockchain con aplicaciones descentralizadas de alta eficiencia, todo mientras promueve la sostenibilidad y un enfoque ecol√≥gico. A diferencia de otras criptomonedas, SLOTHANA busca reducir su huella de carbono y utiliza un modelo de consenso que se centra en la eficiencia energ√©tica.

**Situaci√≥n Actual**

Actualmente, SLOTHANA se encuentra en una fase temprana de adopci√≥n, pero ha mostrado un crecimiento constante. Seg√∫n \[CoinMarketCap\]([https://coinmarketcap.com/](https://coinmarketcap.com/)), SLOTHANA ha experimentado un incremento en su volumen de comercio y ha comenzado a captar la atenci√≥n de inversores interesados en proyectos sostenibles.

Algunos puntos clave sobre la situaci√≥n actual de SLOTHANA:

* **Capitalizaci√≥n de Mercado**: Aunque es modesta en comparaci√≥n con gigantes como Bitcoin y Ethereum, su capitalizaci√≥n ha estado creciendo, lo que sugiere un inter√©s creciente.
* **Tecnolog√≠a**: Utiliza un modelo de consenso Proof of Stake (PoS), que es m√°s eficiente energ√©ticamente que el Proof of Work (PoW) utilizado por Bitcoin.
* **Comunidad**: La comunidad detr√°s de SLOTHANA est√° creciendo, con un aumento en el n√∫mero de seguidores en redes sociales y en foros de criptomonedas.

**Potencial a Futuro**

La proyecci√≥n futura de SLOTHANA se basa en varios factores:

1. **Sostenibilidad**: Con la creciente preocupaci√≥n por el impacto ambiental de las criptomonedas, SLOTHANA podr√≠a posicionarse como una alternativa atractiva.
2. **Innovaci√≥n Tecnol√≥gica**: Si contin√∫an desarrollando su plataforma y mejorando su tecnolog√≠a, podr√≠an atraer a m√°s desarrolladores y usuarios.
3. **Adopci√≥n**: A medida que m√°s personas y empresas busquen opciones de criptomonedas sostenibles, SLOTHANA podr√≠a ver un aumento significativo en su adopci√≥n.

**Opiniones y Debate**

Me encantar√≠a escuchar sus opiniones sobre SLOTHANA. ¬øAlguien m√°s ha invertido en este proyecto? ¬øQu√© piensan sobre su enfoque en la sostenibilidad? ¬øCreen que tiene el potencial para competir con las criptomonedas m√°s establecidas?

Por favor, compartan sus pensamientos y an√°lisis. ¬°Me encantar√≠a ver un debate vibrante en los comentarios!

*Disclaimer*

Este post no es una recomendaci√≥n de compra. Invertir en criptomonedas implica riesgos, y cada persona debe hacer su an√°lisis personal e individual antes de tomar decisiones de inversi√≥n. Aseg√∫rense de investigar y considerar todos los factores antes de invertir en cualquier criptomoneda.

¬°Gracias por leer y espero sus comentarios!

$POWSCHE is giving away a real Porsche,35,1d84gok,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1d84gok/powsche_is_giving_away_a_real_porsche/,93,"$POWSCHE on Solana is back on the track!! It is up by 450% since Sunday and still growing. To help this growth even more, dev decided to hold a real Porsche giveaway. That's right, one lucky $POWSCHE holder will win Porsche once we hit 10M market cap. And the best part is that you can win even with 1 $POWSCHE in your wallet!

**Let me tell you more about this giveaway.** 

All we know so far is that it will happen once $POWSCHE reaches 10M market cap and also how the winner will be chosen. Every participant gets 1 entry for every token he holds and also for every time his refferral is used or for every time he uses refferral of somebody else. No word yet on which Porsche will be competing but believe me when I say that this is something unique and will definitely push $POWSCHE even above 10M target. 

**But $POWSCHE is not just about this giveaway.** 

The marketing team wants to take an advantage of this growth and start pushing Twitter, Reddit, IG, Tiktok and maybe even some paid advertising as hard as possible. All these efforts along with the FOMO of everyone who sold during the dip will skyrocket us right into a new ATH. 

Always DYOR but I believe in $POWSCHE mainly because of the dev's insane strategy and a community that never gives up.

I've heard the Shiba dev is following the project over Twitter. At first, I thought it was too good to be true, so I verified it lately, and man, that alone just got me convicted that this thing is going to be very explosive.

Now, I'm not asking you to take this by word of mouth. Go verify it yourself, go look up @shytoshikusama on Twitter; he's the real Shib dev. Follow him and then head on to the real Kendu Inu Twitter at @KenduInu. You'll see that @shytoshikusama does indeed follow it.

Now, Miyazaki has close connections and is a SHIB OG. There is a lot lined up for this coin when it reaches certain milestones. The Shib dev even popped up in our Telegram and talked to us.

We're going to be featured in the Shib mag when the time comes, and we have several top exchanges lined up for us like Binance and Kraken.

The amount of volume that's to come has made me convicted that we're going to hit SHIB-like levels at 40b~50b market cap levels.

Do your future selves a favor and get in this golden free lottery ticket before you start kicking yourselves in the future for not being in it.

It's going to melt faces this upcoming bull run, and I have no doubt that it will rise to the top and make history in investing when the time comes.

The community of Kendu Chads is just amazing, super helpful, and friendly. ""We work together, and we don't gamble"" is their motto. Check them out on Reddit and the Telegram official channel.

If you still don't feel like getting in, just spend your time with Kendu Chads, and in time, you'll see that this is the best move you could do for yourself. You will gain some conviction in investing for your future, and if it still doesn't rub off on you, then this isn't for you; then just move on.

However, you will be kicking yourself in the future when you do see it pump. You won't get many easy chances like this to get mad easy gains. Take advantage while you still can, take some action, and you will be rewarded.

I legit just gave you a golden lottery ticket; it's truly a gift to even be aware of it and read about it this early at the current market cap compared to where it's going to go.

Join the army; we are a community, and we are the next generation of safe investing, remember we aren't gambling, we work to get it there together as a family of chads.

Now what does this community and investment mean to me?

It means I get to have more well-being for myself, family, and my friends. I get to help out a lot more people for what's to come.

I'm looking for the next chapter in my life with the help of Kendu, and I hope you all make it with me.

Bless you all.

Crypto and AI can transform digital marketing,34,1d2m2mn,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1d2m2mn/crypto_and_ai_can_transform_digital_marketing/,23," I never thought about this concept before but I just finished reading [this article](https://coinedition.com/unleashing-the-power-of-ai-and-its-potential-to-transform-digital-marketing/) and it helped me realize the value of crypto in the upcoming AI revolution.


AI can analyze vast amounts of data to understand customer behavior and personalize marketing campaigns. AI can also automate tasks like content creation and ad placement. This can save marketers time and money while improving campaign performance.



Cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology could further revolutionize this by enabling more secure and transparent data sharing and ad transactions, while also empowering consumers with greater control over their own data. A good example of this mix of crypto and AI is AdEx.

Real adoption, however, will not happen on Desktop. Many people who could really use cryptocurrency in their day-to-day life have no access to desktops, yet 8.5 out of 10 people on Earth have access to a phone. The majority of transactions on-chain will be executed from phones in the future.

With this established, Planq Network is on the right track in my opinion. Accessible to anyone with a mobile phone, Planq is dedicated to bringing blockchain applications directly to mobile devices, facilitating easy access to a diverse ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps). From DeFi platforms to NFT marketplaces, Planq offers a range of projects tailored for mobile accessibility, positioning itself as a force in revolutionizing the adoption of blockchain technology for mobile devices.

Planq Network has already published multiple applications to main net and is attracting builders with a long-term grand program. Being fully self-funded so also a +.

Listings are scarce so far, with a few Dutch exchanges, BingX and Osmosis as their listings so far. You can find much more information here:[ https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/planq/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/planq/)

$LINU Roadmap is out!!,5,1cpmarf,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1cpmarf/linu_roadmap_is_out/,3,"https://preview.redd.it/r5p83bjgytzc1.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=405e5a3f57d48abfd3172076167ef6657287443f

# Roadmap Explained

**Phase 1**

After much effort and removal of bad actors from the old community takeover, February marked the end of Phase 1. Our biggest accomplishment from Phase 1 would be the establishment of a Multi-sig wallet to act as a Community donation pool. All funds currently go to prospective marketing and delivery of funds to CEXes.  
Though we have no current plans to burn any tokens at this price level, a future token burn can be held using the Multi-sig / Donation pool.

**Phase 2**

Given our current state, some parts of Phase 2 are finished and others will need to be constantly revisited.  
We‚Äôre still looking for bigger and better CEXes. We will still pursue creative ways to market LINU.

**Phase 3**

Firstly, **LINU MERCH STORE ON REDBUBBLE!!!!**  
All profits go to the Community Multisig.  
If you wish to contribute a design to the shop, please contact us on Telegram (fast response time) or Twitter (slower response time).

As said before, there will be some repeatable steps in each Phase.  
Community engagement and growth is always something LINU will be wrestling with. We have a core that isn‚Äôt going anywhere but growth is always welcome. We can pursue a branding update / logo redesign if the Community agrees.

**Phase 4**

Here‚Äôs the fun Phase.  
For the sake of not spoiling anything yet, work on a game for LINU has started.  
An NFT redemption collection is an eventuality after we reach a few larger milestones.  
Tier 1 CEXes like CDC, Binance and Coinbase are what we‚Äôre shooting for when it becomes appropriate for us. We will do all we can to lay the groundwork for them in the mean time.

That‚Äôs all we can disclose for this Phase at this time.

**Phase 5**

*Now we‚Äôre getting very ambitious!*

Following in the footsteps of Dogecoin and SHIB, we wish to do more of the same.  
Approaching this Phase, LINU plans to be everywhere at once.  
A global brand if you will.

We also plan to push LINU to participate in the GameFi space eventually.  
We believe a utility project (Aviator) could facilitate the blockchain infrastructure necessary to host a LINU game fully on-chain somewhere in the future.

Still on the topic of Blockchains, we think Luna Inu can initiate it‚Äôs own DEX in the way of SHIB with Shibarium given the proper backing.

**Phase 6**

Oh yeah, we‚Äôre serious.

*See you in Monaco with the F1's!!*

**Persistence is key.**

Through so much volatility, our community hasn‚Äôt given up.  
Our team hasn‚Äôt given up either. We‚Äôre still taking the necessary steps to keep the token alive.

**Join us for the ride while it‚Äôs still early!**

According to the Binance Crypto Fear & Greed Index, the market is at greed, a little more than neutral at 65. As last week, we are seeing 72, which is significant as compared to this week. Solana is trading at a discount from its peak in April. From the peak of 200$ to the lowest near 124$, and is currently trading around 140$. What are the expectations for Solana's future price?¬†¬†

Solana URL:[https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/solana](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/solana)

From Coingecko, Solana chain has a market dominance of 4.2%; however, base chain and arbitrum are chasing tight behind. Personally, I heard about Base Chain‚Äôs memecoins rising, and I think they have huge potential. With only 1.79% dominance, there is a huge space for growth. Base has been performing significantly for the past 30 days, whereas Solana has underperformed as compared.

Solana has several robust memecoins with a huge market cap, which undoubtedly boosts its value. Such as WIF,BONK,BOME,POPCAT, MEW, and Honerable mention (POWSCHE$). Maneki and Gummy sparked the market this week.

Base has Brett with dominating performances as compared to its peers in the chain. There are still spaces with huge potential for new 100 million market cap coins in the near future in the chain.¬†

So, I've been checking out a few memecoins lately, and here's the scoop:

On Ethereum, you've got some classics like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. They're like the OGs of the memecoin scene, with huge communities and wild fluctuations.

Then there's Binance Smart Chain (BSC), home to tokens like SafeMoon and Baby Doge. They're all about those crazy reflections and tokenomics.

But you know what's really catching my eye right now? $Powsche on Solana. It's like the underdog of the bunch, but it's got serious potential. The community is super tight-knit, and they're doing some cool stuff with NFTs and charity projects.

Overall, each blockchain has its own vibe when it comes to memecoins. Ethereum for the big names, BSC for the reflections, and Solana for that hidden gem like $Powsche. Definitely worth keeping an eye on! üöÄ

Memecoins performance after halving?,37,1cefs12,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1cefs12/memecoins_performance_after_halving/,41,"Hello everyone, in this thread I would like to discuss memecoins that blew out this year and have changed the lives of many people.

I started buying crypto in 2019 but I personally don't invest much in smaller memecoins because they are risky and unreliable, but when I discover one that has huge potential, a great community and a strong dev team, I can't help myself and have to buy smaller amounts and watch these tokens increase in value 10x, 50x or even 100x

This year we've seen several memecoins (BOME, MEW, BRETT, etc.) absolutely explode in price, even before Bitcoin's halving. Therefore, I believe we will see dozens more memecoins do the same this year.

In this part of my post, I would like to share with you three memecoins that caught my attention recently. I am not advertising these tokens there or telling you to buy them, always DYOR and never listen to random people you don't know, I just want to know your opinion and provide you with some  information after watching and studying these tokens for weeks.

The tickers are PONKE ([https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ponke/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ponke/)), POWSCHE ([https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/powsche/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/powsche/)) and LINU ([https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/luna-inu-/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/luna-inu-/)). 

Some of you can be familiar with PONKE. It is a bigger token aimed at normies with its strong game on instagram, tiktok and twitter. It is already listed on bigger exchanges like Gate, HTX or MEXC.

https://preview.redd.it/2vntmntr71xc1.jpg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f414106192574b000af3911408ac718285b58f3c

POWSCHE is a smaller market cap token with a community that is usual for much bigger coins and an  ambitious dev team working hard. They have big goals such as Tesla burning at 50mil market cap and Lambo burning at 100mil market cap, also the fact that it's the first car based memecoin specifically focused on car guys can be extremely beneficial.

https://preview.redd.it/s78ixd6t71xc1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a5c393d687cb0fa38e9fc2b06138f1e575d76e22

LINU is the only community driven token. It is already listed on Bitmart and according to the admins big things are coming. Biggest green flag of this coin is its huge liquidity and holder count. The admin team is strong and I believe they will achieve many goals this bullrun.

In 2023 following the November 30, 2022, debut of ChatGPT by San Francisco-based OpenAI. AI is poised to bring forth several revolutionary advancements in the cryptocurrency space. Nevertheless, despite the widespread use of AI projects, there is no monetization of related operations.

As a result, after years of working for companies like Coinbase, Oracle, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Microsoft, Symbiont, and Disney, a group of experts got together to create RaiinMaker. This will be the main driver behind the AI, Web3, and DePIN nodes toward a future where technology and practicality meet and users of the app can monetize their activities without excluding cryptocurrency.

RaiinMaker provides a futuristic look at the enormous potential of AI in the Web3 and cryptocurrency sectors to revolutionize the way people use these technologies and speed up cryptocurrency transactions. The majority of Web3, DePIN node, AI, and cryptocurrency aficionados joined the RaiinMaker validator testnet airdrop for this reason [https://www.raiinmaker.com/airdrop](https://www.raiinmaker.com/airdrop).

The innovative Web3 and AI technology company Raiinmaker is the creator of the Raiinmaker Mobile Application and Raiinmaker Network. The new Web3 and decentralized AI platform, the Raiinmaker App, revolutionized the marketing of user contributions to AI infrastructure. By combining scalable Web3 and AI infrastructure, the Raiinmaker Network redefines value production concerning digital identity, conduct, and reputation. Because of the strength of the Raiinmaker Network, the native Protocol Web3 features of the Raiinmaker AI Super App are incorporated with ease. Among these are identity, token creation, NFT minting, and AI-powered smart contracts. In essence, Raiinmaker is supporting a novel idea: transforming consumers from doers into actual value creators in the digital space.

To facilitate the widespread adoption of Web3 and decentralized AI, Raiinmaker and BASE are dedicated to developing technology and products that place a high priority on flawless user experience and frictionless onboarding. ¬†

As of right now, Raiinmaker's Validator Testnet AirDrop on the DePIN is coming to an end.¬†¬†

Urgent Call to Action: Kucoin's Unjust Delisting Policy Resulting in Severe Losses,0,1c71572,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1c71572/urgent_call_to_action_kucoins_unjust_delisting/,5,"Recently, Kucoin made the decision to delist the XHV coin, effectively locking away our hard-earned investments. This alone is frustrating, but what's truly infuriating is their refusal to allow users to withdraw their funds within a reasonable timeframe. As a result, I've been robbed of 40,000 XHV coins, valued at over $40,000 USD at the time of purchase.

Let's call it what it is: theft. Kucoin's disregard for their users' financial well-being is appalling and unacceptable. What's worse is the complete lack of communication. I, like many others, have received no email notifications regarding this matter. This cannot be legal.

It's time to take action. I have been tirelessly trying to communicate my situation to Kucoin for weeks, even months, but all I received were automated responses with no further communication whatsoever.

I am seeking fellow users who have been affected by Kucoin's delisting policy to join forces in pursuing legal action. Together, we can hold Kucoin accountable for their actions and seek justice for the losses we've incurred.

To strengthen our case, I am actively searching for lawyers with expertise in crypto-related matters, particularly in Hong Kong and Singapore. If you know of any legal professionals who can assist us in this fight, please reach out.

Additionally, I urge all affected users to come forward and share your experiences. By gathering evidence and forming a strong team, we can build a compelling case against Kucoin.

This is not just about seeking compensation for our losses; it's about standing up against injustice and ensuring that exchanges like Kucoin are held responsible for their actions. Our voices must be heard, and our rights must be protected.

Their recent [collaboration with Human Code](https://financefeeds.com/ton-society-collaborates-with-humancode-to-initiate-a-5-million-digital-identity-verification-incentive-program/) shows that they are committed to the goal of removing fake users from the platform through privacy-oriented ID verification.

$AVI - A hidden gem that will ride the BASE wave,29,1c2bqyf,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1c2bqyf/avi_a_hidden_gem_that_will_ride_the_base_wave/,25,"Aviator will build a bridge to Base that outperforms all current bridging solutions in terms of time to bridge, cost and functionality - Skybridge.

After that is out shortly (test net likely releasing this weekend), they will port their own project via skybridge to be on Base.

Their long game is an arcade, similar to newgrounds and later possibly Desktop games too, allowing developers to gain an Audience and monetize their game through Play2Earn features.

This is just a quick recap, thought it might be interesting for some to get in early on this.  
I can easily see this getting a Coinbase listing in the long run, as the team is doing everything to be compliant - with their Bridge just getting a 10/10 audit score from hacken ([https://hacken.io/audits/aviator---skybridge/](https://hacken.io/audits/aviator---skybridge/)) , third party kyc, multi sig locks and more (Check dextools too!).

So far, the coin only has some attention from 4chan and got a TINY mention in a Brian Jung video - So this is still really early.

As always, dyor, check the whitepaper (flightpaper as they call it). Here is some links for research purposes:

But how to know which ones to back? Imminent Bitcoin halving and bullish market sentiments can only take you so far. Only a robust narrative that will transform the crypto and web3 space can translate into a rewarding success story. Oasis Network stands tall with its cutting-edge smart privacy solutions that touch almost every aspect of web3 - DeFi, AI, account abstraction, SocialFi, even DAOs, web3 gaming, and NFTs.

The renewed focus on privacy is aligned with the Oasis mission and vision of a uniquely scalable, privacy-first, and versatile web3 through confidential computation and the use of trusted execution environments. This has gelled so well with crypto AI that recently Oasis ([native token - ROSE](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/oasis-network/)) was lauded by crypto.com as one of the [top 10 AI tokens to know in 2024](https://crypto.com/university/top-10-ai-tokens). Oasis, however, continues to emphasize privacy as the underlying narrative that enables the better, safer web3 experience for everyone. Its participation and role as a sponsor in worldwide blockchain events also demonstrates this. 

After the roaring success of ETHDenver, Oasis is now prepping for ETHDam. In between, it made its presence quietly yet strongly felt at the inaugural ETHBucharest edition (catch the [highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0LADlKhCQ) here). Since then, Oasis has also been named as one of the official [sponsors of the dAppCon](https://twitter.com/dappcon_berlin/status/1775531931930611991) at Berlin later this year. However, ETHDam remains special as Oasis is the [main sponsor](https://oasisprotocol.org/blog/oasis-at-ethdam-main-sponsorship) along with the event host - CryptoCanal. 

The [3-day event](https://oasisprotocol.org/ethdam-2024) is scheduled for April 12-14. Oasis Technical Product Manager, Harry Roberts is the keynote speaker at the Grote Zaal - ETHDam Main Stage on April 12 which precedes the privacy panel talk featuring some stalwarts from the blockchain world. One of the star attractions of ETHDam this year is the hackathon organized by Oasis. The bounty is a generous $10k prize pool inviting projects to leverage Oasis's confidential Sapphire EVM features like private storage, RNG, encryption, key generation, and signing.

With less than a week to go before ETHDam starts, Oasis Software Engineer, Matevz Jekovec recently conducted an [in-depth workshop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZo32OljWs8) for Solidity devs and dApp builders. While it is true only hardcore and tech-savvy altcoin enthusiasts could appreciate the detailed learning resources and tooling, the key takeaway was its immense helpfulness for prospective hackathon participants at ETHDam. 

There are also surprises waiting at ETHDam 2024. Prominent among these is when Oasis fulfills its promise of a grand revelation of its brand refresh that will underline its position as the leading voice of web3 privacy. Also, extending ETHDam beyond the Grote Zaal by taking it across Amsterdam, several other Ethereum-based and privacy-focused workshops, networking events, etc are planned and will soon be announced. 

So, if you are a privacy maxi or count yourself among hackers, crypto natives, and creators in an EVM ecosystem, come and join ETHDam for three exciting days, starting April 12! ",2024-04-06 00:26:20,1712381180.0

This could be a game-changer, right?  
The idea of a perpetual DEX isn't just new; it's revolutionary. Think about it: combining the security and robustness of Bitcoin with the endless possibilities of DeFi. Velar is aiming to bridge these two worlds, potentially opening up a whole new realm of trading strategies and opportunities that were previously confined to traditional finance or not possible due to the limitations of existing blockchain infrastructures.  
What intrigues me the most is how they plan to tackle the common DeFi issues like liquidity and security. Plus, operating on Bitcoin could bring a level of stability and trust that's hard to find in the current Ethereum-dominated DeFi space. But I have questions‚Äîhow will they ensure deep liquidity? What mechanisms are in place to protect users against the inherent volatility?  
Would love to hear your thoughts on this. Could Velar's approach to perpetual DEXs on Bitcoin be the breakthrough we've been waiting for in DeFi?

(Down 20% from recent high.)

Not financial advice.  
Links to the chart and previous post below. 

In the last 4 months, they have seen 50% holder growth.  This sets up well for incoming testnet.   This launch is significant as the team has held back on marketing until they can truly market the product.   This will enable 27 million devs to easily start building blockchain solutions, due to smart contracts in ANY programing language. 

They also had news that an EU country is working with their tech stack,  and Ethereum board member Patrick Storchenegger is the CEO of the IP holding company. 

Altogether this sets up well for a strong month.  I speculate they will also make some moves with exchanges or announcing more information about around partnerships.  

Either way,  the community devs that have already worked with the product are impressed.   Once that spreads through the dev community,  look out. 

FYI- there is a privatenet already publicly available ( which is how the devs already tried it out).  So the foundation of key features is already proven!  They will add Proof of Stake for public consensus. And a royalty feature for devs that provide reusable contracts.

Last, they expect to have an easy 1-click migrate for evm compatible contacts.   This ecosystem will ignite!

What‚Äôs up with TonCoin?,13,1blnez2,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1blnez2/whats_up_with_toncoin/,51,"
I‚Äôve been looking into a cryptocurrency called ""TonCoin"" and found something odd. There aren't many YouTube videos about it, most have just less than 1000 views, and its Subreddit is almost empty.

But for some reason, ""TonCoin"" is ranked 11th in market value. This is really surprising to me: who is investing in ""TonCoin""? It doesn't seem like a lot of regular folks are talking about it or buying it. I haven't seen much excitement or hype around ""TonCoin"" yet, but maybe that will change?

Does anyone have any thoughts or info on why ""TonCoin"" is doing so well in terms of its market position? I'm curious to know more about this unexpected rise.

My moon bag for the next bull run,47,1bj9pn8,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1bj9pn8/my_moon_bag_for_the_next_bull_run/,63," These are my bags for the next bull run. I already made over 10X, so I am convinced it will pump really hard. Some are based on utility, while others are just based on community hype.    


First on my list is Floki. Yeah,¬† it‚Äôs a meme, but the community is really strong, and they are doing a lot of charity programs in Africa, which means they have good VC backing. I think it might flip Shiba, and it's just about 2B MC.  

The second is QANX; it‚Äôs a possible 100X; this one has utility; and its blockchain just got adopted by a country in the EU, which I believe is a huge buy signal. Now that a country has started using blockchain because of its security, I believe banks might get in too soon, and you know what they say: follow where the money goes.   

The last, but not least, is SOL. I wrote a thread a few months ago about this, and whoever ever bought SOL with me at $10 will be in huge profit now. IMO, SOL might flip ETH, as we can see many are beginning to jump on it, and the new memecoin trend will be in the SOL ecosystem rather than ETH.  

Anyway, feel free to share with me what you are holding so I can add that to my list of coins to research

Everyone hears stories about the Doge Millionaire and the famous 7000$ shib buy that turned into billions, reminiscing about how they missed their chance and regret it daily.

CORGI IS that next big chance. Buying in today will land you in the millionaire range as we hit the 100m market cap - chump change to meme coins as we have seen recently with Shib, floki, Pepe, and now even Dogwifhat. Those ships have sailed - no matter what you buy in with today, those can‚Äôt make you a Millie (market cap alone makes it impossible). Getting in on a low cap with big potential is 100% the way to make 10,000% returns - with a vetted history, locked LP, burned keys and a 100% CERTIK audit‚Ä¶ there isn‚Äôt a safer gamble out there.

But don‚Äôt just take it from me - do your own research, swing by their socials and decide on your own! If you find ANYTHING questionable about the coin, please post here!

Why ApeX should be on the top of your DeFi watchlist,34,1binge5,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1binge5/why_apex_should_be_on_the_top_of_your_defi/,9,"So Cryptowiser just [put out an article](https://www.cryptowisser.com/apex-stands-out-as-hot-defi-token-to-watch/) that goes deep into the $APEX token and why it may be severely underrated in the current market conditions. Here is a quick breakdown:


* Market potential: DEXs are gaining traction due to security concerns with centralized exchanges (CEXs). The perpetuals market, where ApeX Pro focuses, is also on the rise.


* Competition: ApeX Pro is a competitor to dYdX, another DEX leader. However, ApeX Pro has a lower market cap and has grown faster in the last year.


* Tokenomics: Similar to dYdX, APEX has a limited supply and offers staking rewards. ApeX is taking steps to manage an upcoming token unlock to avoid price drops.


What are your thoughts on this?

Many standards like ERC20, ERC404 and ERC7621 are one of them. Plenty of well-known digital currencies use the ERC20 standard including Maker, Basic Attention Token, Augur and OMG Network. 

Today I'm talking about its new standard ERC7621 is surprisingly going to be used by many other projects to offer their native token and ALVARA  Protocol is launched under the ERC20 standard though working with the same. Alvara‚Äôs protocol is heavily structured around bringing utility to the new ERC-7621 tokenstandard, created by Alvara‚Äôs developers. The ERC-7621 is a new token standard that facilitates the implementation of investment
funds on the blockchain, also known as a BTS (Basket Token Standard). A BTS can hold any
number of underlying assets within it, providing they are tokenized and available on a
supported EVM blockchain or via an integration with Wormhole or similar ERC-7621 will become the go-to standard for on-chain fund management. In the beginning, it'll launch with ERC20 standard, the token will also be deployed on other chains BNB, Fantom, and Avalanche C-chain. In addition to Ethereum, the protocol will run on several major EVM-compatiblechains.

ALVA has a maximum total supply of 200 million tokens, within the specific parameters set in the smart contract the tokens can be both minted and burned. The minting features will maintain the requirement of the tokens in the market while burning features will assist in raising its value. The token has 3 significant use cases in the platform. First, users can access voting power by staking their ALVA to obtain veALVA. This veALVA can be used within the Alvara DAO to vote on proposals. Second, users can stake their ALVA and get a decent reward. The last and third one is every BTS minted on Alvara will contain ALVA token at a minimum weighting of 5% and later this ALVA will be purchased from the open market. This feature will put upward pressure on ALVA's market price each time a new BTS is launched as well as additional BTS LPs created by platform users on the other hand it'll reduce a percentage of ALVA token's supply from the circulating market.

With Meme Season pretty much upon us, this coin has taken my curiosity and I have entered the cat market. It previously has achieved 120m Market Cap with an actual team of devs actively working on to also have utility - a community coin essentially. The market cap is sitting at a humble 3 million with a few mini pumps having occurred recently.

Not trying to Shill here, but curious as to what other cat coins people are hunting, and if Dinger truly has the potential to take the prime spot. currently only a DEX coin, but if this makes it to CEX's, could it be the next BONK or Pepe? 

Dinger has seen some rallying in terms of volume so I believe there is definitely potential on this one.

Do any of the OGs remember this coin from back in the day?

I was in the middle of editing this and had to visit coinmarketcap to get the link when I saw that my Shiba had topped my limit price, so that part of the question is now moot, but I still have the question about the xyo. Plus, the general question about how you make these decisions. Are you able to keep emotions completely out of it? 

---
I made purchases that I now think were questionable. I've been in and out of Shiba Inu and xyo a couple of times and made a small profit. I'm into xyo at just over 0.013, I think. And into Shiba Inu at if I remember correctly 0.000034.

They are both down from those positions. A lesson I learned early on that has done me well is that it's not a loss until you sell. However, that was with Bitcoin, not these little alts.  I don't know if I can trust them.

The major components of the Gaming project are Game Finance in short Gamefi and NFTs. GameFi introduces decentralized economies and player ownership of in-game assets as NFTs. 

Playzap is an addition for skill-based players to showcase their talent and be rewarded accordingly. By using blockchain technology their platform leverages a secure and transparent gaming environment for their users. Users can experience multi-gaming features from one single platform that's to play different games from a single platform without any upfront cost. Since its focus is on skill-based gameplay it'll enhance its platform and reward will be distributed in a fair way based on the more skilled player, the higher the efficiency to earn reward. 

On the other hand, as it is directly associated with NFTs that means the integration of this into their concept is inevitable which will add another layer of value to the gaming experience. Simply by participating in game activities players can collect, trade and own unique digital assets through NFTs. These pieces of NFTs can hold intrinsic value within the PlayZap platform and potentially in external markets as well. 

PZP, the native token of this platform was recently listed in an eminent trading platform Bitget and suddenly observed a growth in its price. PZP went up to 0.99 cents post listing there in the Bitget market and went up to 0.54 cents high in other listed exchange 1-day antecedent Bitget listing. This native token has the utility to bring attention amongst others from a huge crowd resulting in gradually securing all the prominent listings. In terms of creating utility they're endeavouring to create the utility of this currency by integrating it with their platform, simply players can utilise PZP to participate in tournaments and compete in PvP challenges. Besides this, it can also be utilised to purchase limited edition NFTs and participate in jackpot matches where users can amplify their earnings with a chance to get higher rewards and more.

Privacy Coins vs Privacy-first Blockchain Protocols: Distinctly Different Deals,1,1b66st2,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1b66st2/privacy_coins_vs_privacyfirst_blockchain/,7,"Privacy as a narrative will define the next era of blockchain and the web3 revolution. While the blockchain privacy paradox stumped crypto developers and enthusiasts in the initial years of development of the crypto space, thanks to various privacy-preserving techniques in use today, the solution is already here. Some would say privacy coins have been in our midst for quite some time now. So, why this sudden focus on privacy in blockchains? Aren't they the same thing differently described?

It's myth-busting time. Privacy coins are not the same as privacy-first blockchain protocols using confidentiality solutions. Let's dig a little deeper.

Privacy coins are tokens that enable anonymity in cryptocurrency, mainly dealing with non-traceable transactions. For example, Monero or Zcash are privacy coins. However, the token of a blockchain protocol with a privacy-first approach in its technology and use cases has no privacy features unlike privacy coins, can be easily traced through explorers, and, therefore, is not a privacy coin.

Protocols like Oasis Network, Secret Network, Aztec, Aleph Zero, Phala Network, Raligun, etc promote privacy in the blockchain and web3 space by implementing data confidentiality solutions through privacy-preserving techniques such as TEEs (trusted execution environment), ZKP (zero-knowledge proof), FHE (fully homomorphic encryption), sMPC (secure multi-party computation), etc.

Let's take a further look at Oasis and its [native token, Rose](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/oasis-network/). Oasis offers a confidential computing platform through its Sapphire confidential EVM (L1 runtime) and cross-chain framework, Oasis Privacy Layer or OPL (L2). While privacy coins have only a narrow scope of applicability in anonymous transactions, Oasis goes the extra mile as its web3 infrastructure and tools are empowered with smart privacy that serves builders and users alike by enabling data sovereignty, integrity and protection. The USP here is making confidentiality flexible so that it can easily optimize degrees of efficiency, compliance, secrecy, or all of the above, depending on unique use cases.  And, Rose is simply a utility token for securing the technology of the protocol, paying gas fees, staking, etc. Here is a [detailed discussion](https://oasisprotocol.org/blog/confidential-computing-platform-not-privacy-coin-explainer) about why Rose is not a privacy coin.

Here is a fun fact if you are a fan of privacy-first blockchain protocols. Did you know there is an international alliance of protocols that seeks to advance the understanding of privacy? Many of the altcoin examples mentioned above are members, so check out the [Universal Privacy Alliance](https://privacyalliance.com/) or UPA. For the privacy enthusiasts, their unifying principles will surely resonate.",2024-03-04 03:28:17,1709544497.0

The problem is high gas fees - even when gas fees are low it charges me $15-$20 to swap. E.g., I want to buy Rollbit (RLB) - if I swap 0.1 ETH ($345 at time of writing) it will charge me $50. Is there any solution to this?

Some coins aren't even on Arbitrum's network, like Rollbit (RLB). So I'm a bit confused how crypto traders make their alpha when some altcoins on ethereum have these gas fees.

The primary goal is to reduce Bitcoin's environmental impact, enhance scalability, and improve overall efficiency. Notably, Social Network plans to integrate Arbitrum's rollup technology, known for its open-source solutions, contributing 10% of its sequencer revenue to support the open-source nature of Arbitrum's stack.



In addition to the collaboration with ChainSafe for advanced cryptographic techniques connecting Bitcoin and Ethereum networks, Social Network is partnering with LaunchNodes to simplify the deployment of its Earth Nodes ‚Äì an energy-efficient Bitcoin solution ‚Äì on major cloud services like AWS and Google Cloud. 



The company has also teamed up with ThreeFold to leverage ZeroOS for decentralized data storage, aiming to move away from traditional cloud services and achieve petabyte-scale data storage capacity.

DIMO is a passive earning source by simply monetising your car's data,2,1b1h5u0,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1b1h5u0/dimo_is_a_passive_earning_source_by_simply/,7,"
Technology is ever-growing, in today's world, we're being offered a variety of services through technology. From food & beverage to clothing & all types of utility services are served through the internet. Even transportation is as easy as we can book it from one tap of our fingertips. 

Dimo was launched with a vision to build a world where technology serves people first. In this world developers can innovate freely, privacy coexists with progress, and human-centric connected mobility can flourish. It's now tradeable from more than one major trading platform as such Coinbase, Gate, Bitget, Uniswap Dex and a few others.  

As a DAO-based project, DIMO holders have the benefit of claiming voting rights for this project. It seems interesting to me when a user can delegate their voting power to themselves (allowing them to vote directly) or even to someone else without having to transfer their tokens. There are steps one must take to vote. To have your tokens counted you must delegate your voting power even though if you want to vote with your tokens you still must delegate them to yourself. When you delegate, your tokens stay securely in your wallet. You always retain full control and can still transfer them. You can change who you've delegated to at any time. Once you delegate, the person you delegate to will be able to vote with your tokens in all future votes until you redelegate to someone else.

DIMO Mobile is the first app that allows you to own and monetize your car‚Äôs data. Since monetising thus you're earning from it hence a passive income source is originated out of it. In order to start the first step is to download and install the Dimo app in your car's software otherwise you have to purchase a DIMO hardware wallet and then connect it with your car and it's done. App or hardware wallet is compatible with any car model that's 2008 or newer having all major brands like Toyota, Ford, Jeep, Hyundai, Tesla and BMW. 

Now you can earn while driving and maintaining your car. When users spend money at participating merchants for car-related expenses like fuel, maintenance, or accessories, they'll earn DIMO tokens as a reward. The amount of tokens earned will depend on the specific promotion or offer provided by the merchant. Just choose a specific merchant through the DIMO app or you can choose your familiarise merchants as they should be listed there. You can manage your earned tokens and rewards from the app and redeem tokens for discounts, deals, or services within the DIMO ecosystem through your account.

They have a wallet that connects directly to your twitter profile (soon to be other socials), which is currently boasting over 100k users. They recently completed a partnership with rarible, and user adoption is growing rapidly

TLDR; this is a no brainer. Over the last few weeks we‚Äôve seen several micro caps explode (ABT)

Currently valued at $1.1180 on February 17, 2024, it represents a remarkable 309.5% increase since January 1, 2023. Throughout the past year, BGB has marked notable milestones, including its peak of $0.5152 in February 2023, a subsequent rise to $0.67 in June, and a pinnacle of $1.01 in December before retracement. This growth trajectory stems from various factors. Bitget's robust performance as a leading crypto exchange, coupled with the adoption of its Copy Trading platform, has bolstered BGB's value proposition. Additionally, the token's limited supply and burning mechanisms, along with strategic marketing initiatives, have enhanced its utility and scarcity, driving investor interest. Furthermore, the broader crypto market sentiment and the increasing interest in DeFi and token utilities have played pivotal roles in catalyzing BGB's growth trajectory. Bitget BGB stands as a testament to resilience and utility, reflecting the dynamic evolution of the crypto landscape.

NAVI becomes the first Native One-Stop Liquidity Protocol on Sui,2,1apu46j,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1apu46j/navi_becomes_the_first_native_onestop_liquidity/,4,"The best way to earn passive income from your cryptocurrency is either lending or staking it for a certain period. Users always prefer to trade and amplify their portfolio with those earnings but it's always not going as we want sometimes trading is a bit risky, especially in the bear market and probably it went south for this specific time duration and required a pause. Henceforth staking or lending your stable coins or cryptos for that specific period can encompass your portfolio strongly. 

Here come up with a resolution but it's often challenging to find a trusted and authentic platform prudently. It requires immense practice and DYOR to pursue a substantial platform for the purpose. Lately, I have encountered a newly launched platform NAVX seems trustworthy and it got my attention due to its conceptual facts resulting in it having confirmed Bitget listing last week. With its vast range of features and services being offered by them, I'm here only introducing some of its attractive features through this article that catches my attention. 

Navi is a decentralized liquidity protocol, offering lending and borrowing to a vast range of users flawlessly without the interference of any other third party or any intermediaries, making it possible with a shared liquidity pool system. Project Navi is generating its revenue mainly from the below-shortlisted process:- Staking, Governance, Fee Collection and Distribution and lastly Fee Discounts. One of its key earning methods that's governance system will allow Navi token holders to vote on proposals and changes to the protocol, these changes include setting interest rates, adding new assets to the protocol, and changing the collateralization ratio. 

Navi becomes the first Native One-Stop Liquidity Protocol on Sui. With its liquidity protocol offering it enables users to participate as liquidity providers or borrowers within the Sui Ecosystem. As the liquidity providers supply assets to the market, earning passive income through yields, while borrowers have the flexibility to obtain loans for different assets. This way it's generating two ways of revenue both from lenders as well as borrowers. 

As it has a broadly minded vision to run in the long term and I was able to be specific on only those nominal features that I was able to find out of it so let's have a look for the more info section or white paper of this project to know more about the project meanwhile I'm eager to see your findings in this regard and let us know what were your findings.

"Qanplatform- deep value analysis. It's not pumping atm, so you have time",22,1amt0wd,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1amt0wd/qanplatform_deep_value_analysis_its_not_pumping/,9,"[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/qanplatform/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/qanplatform/)   


My analysis, not financial advice.  You can see this one is down 60% from recent high, so not sharing this after it already took off.  This is not TA, and I wouldn't advise even trying TA with this one.

"" On top of that, they have ensured evm compatibility, along with a private/hybrid/public design. With the ability to code in any language, this will be an easy choice for business to engage in blockchain solutions. They can start testing a privatenet for next to nothing just like the community devs did. ""  


I lead in with the above because people think QANX is all about quantum resistance.  It's not- they certainly are prepared for it which you will be seeing all systems start doing this year.  So, it won't even be a feature in the longer term, it will be required to survive.  But, enough on that.  


Here's why I see recent events as very bullish. 

Qanplatform has long been seeking to deliver a chain that enables:

\- Smart contracts using any coding language

\- Signatures that implement post-quantum security

\- A royalty feature for reusable code

\- Consensus that aimed to improve upon Proof of Stake, which they termed Proof of Randomness

These are all considered IP in that they are protecting them until they build up market share before they will be open source with the mainnet.

They have proven they have a working product that delivers the top 2. In fact, community devs have been hosting their own privatenet where they are demonstrating the capabilities.

On top of that, they have ensured evm compatibility, along with a private/hybrid/public design. With the ability to code in any language, this will be an easy choice for business to engage in blockchain solutions. They can start testing a privatenet for next to nothing just like the community devs did.

With that, the team had a good year, landing nice partnerships and 15M financial backing from MBK. They also updated tokenomics to prepare for a proper mainnet, removing almost half the tokens that were allocated to the team/project work.

So, things were looking really good until they announced their testnet was delayed from previous expectations. Price fell over 60%, and my guess is mostly due to fear the mainnet would not arrive in time to take advantage of bull market/halving.

Well, they now shared they will go to market using Proof of Stake, rather than the improved consensus they planned to use. For anyone paying attention, this is huge news! It tells me this:

\- There is an urgency to release the primary product

\- There is less risk as they don't have to ""prove"" the consensus

\- There may be other players recommending this approach, or important reasons they need to get going without delay.

They can always improve upon consensus as time goes on, just like btc, eth, and any other chain have done.

I've followed this a long time, and of course am invested. I applaud this news. I've remained an investor primarily because I think they are delivering a product that businesses will be able to engage with quickly, without needing to justify major investments. They really have removed the barriers. And I've seen Johann the CTO in action, from being on stage with NIST and IBM, to navigating difficult times. They seem to bounce back stronger, and that tells me they have a product worth fighting for.

Feel free to google qanplatform roadmap to learn more.

Oh, and there are quite a few things we are waiting on- improved liquidity/more exchanges, updates to various listings reflecting supply (they removed 1/3 of supply by taking almost half of the team allocated tokens.  Another major move to prepare for main), showcasing partner use of privatenet, etc.  All upside in my eyes.  Cheers",2024-02-09 11:07:17,1707498437.0
Rumours of Bringing RWA with some big realestate properties from ABU dhabi with fractional ownership . partnership between Mantra ($OM) and Abu Dhabi Global Markets (ADGM),125,1alxsid,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1alxsid/rumours_of_bringing_rwa_with_some_big_realestate/,270,"Speculation abounds regarding a potential collaboration between $OM Mantra and Abu Dhabi Global Market for fractional real estate ownership. Whispers hint that the remarkable surge in MANTRA $OM on Binance, steadily increasing by 10-15% daily, could be attributed to an undisclosed partnership. Additional insights from the grapevine, such as an influencer's tweet suggesting MANTRA's involvement in bringing Real World Assets (RWA) to Cosmos, further fuel the speculation. Could a multitude of undisclosed partnerships be behind the 800% surge in price over the last 45 days? Uncertainty prevails, yet the rumor mill continues to spin.

Bitget has announced its new Launchpool event,2,1al4y6c,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1al4y6c/bitget_has_announced_its_new_launchpool_event/,1,"Nowadays it is probably hard to find new events providing bountiful earning opportunities for traders, users and newbies. Sometimes we look for events that provide plenteous benefits but eventually end up getting very tiny amounts of reward for participation. Bitget is offering its Launchpool event for one of its newly listed ZETA projects sharing a huge amount of approximately 336k USDT worth of rewards. However individual reward depends on the amount of BGB that has been staked by a single participant implying that it can vary from participant to participant. The amount of BGB can a single person stake is capped at 100k BGB which is almost impalpable. 

Regardless of BGB staked, prize pool ROI can fluctuate over time and is 0.88% at present seems dynamic as incredibly increased from 0.5% thus it's albeit inevitable to change. Henceforth we might expect ROI to go as higher as the amount of BGB continues to accrue meanwhile we can't ignore the potential of BGB as it keeps rising with it. More than 36 Million BGB was staked so far assuming steady growth in its price. As I can remember the price of the BGB gained significant changes since the launchpool announcement from 0.58 cents to 0.64 cents which ultimately amplified those portfolios endured holding since the beginning of this Launchpool. The more the amount of BGB will be staked more the price will be enlarged resulting in participants ending up getting decent ROI on their investments and ZETA as a staking reward which is lucrative from my perspective.

Basically token has a 15% tax for being bought, sold, staked, and unstaked. This tax is put into a reserve to payout stakeholders and promote longer term holding.

Previous bull run, I used to stake [UTK](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/xmoney) (now xMoney) and [BNB](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bnb), didn't go so well, in fact I even managed to lose BNB from that wallet, not sure how, though. After that, I moved to staking [DOT](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/polkadot) and [ACH](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/alchemy-pay), not happy with the gains since they dipped badly.

Entire 2023 I staked [CVX](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/convex-finance) and used my right to vote for proposals, earned a bit of [FXS](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/frax-share) and USDC there, but nothing significant. 

At the moment, I am exploring DAOs, and in all honesty, it is going well compared to staking but not as good as hodling. Using MKR to vote on [MakerDAO](https://gov.daomaker.com/#/) platform, but not for all proposals. Sometimes I delegate my right to other reputable individuals. Also I am on [DIA DAO](https://www.diadata.org/dao/), smaller community compared to Maker, but earnings are bigger although proportionally I hold the same amounts. 2 years ago I tried Compound also, but earnings weren't that good, didn't follow them lately.

So, there you have my passive income history. What's yours?",2024-01-22 03:49:31,1705916971.0
Tech-orientated altcoin with utilization: Siacoin,5,19bn6hc,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/19bn6hc/techorientated_altcoin_with_utilization_siacoin/,7,"I'm not sure if people heard of it since the downfall of Skynet Labs (that took away a lot of attention from the project), but the Sia network is being continuously developed by an organization called the Sia Foundation.  


The cool thing about this project is that the coin is actually being actively utilized to form contracts between renters & hosts, keeping the economy healthy & assuring that the coin price rises naturally.  


As a non-profit organization it's focused solely on the tech (instead of selling empty promises for hype) to deliver a decentralized data storage network with ""no intermediaries, no borders, no vendor lock-in, no spying, no throttling, no walled gardens"", opening the gates to a truly free Internet where big tech won't own you.  


I hope this project gets more exposure, since it's trying to offer a solution to a problem that is keep getting worse. If there is any interest, feel free to check out their site: [https://sia.tech/](https://sia.tech/)

The market recovery led to significant price surges in exchange tokens like FTT, MX, and BGB, with FTT experiencing a remarkable 270% surge, linked to SEC Chairman Gary Gensler's positive statement. FTT's momentum continued with FTX announcements, while MX, GT, OKB, and CET showed lower liquidity. Despite HT having a high liquidity ratio, its price dropped by around 50%, indicating a negative trend for HTX traders. Despite being relatively new, BGB, experienced exceptional growth in 2023 with a 291% increase in price surpassing the rise of BTC in the same period,  reaching an all-time high of 0.70499.
110% spike in trading volume. Number of BGB holders nearly doubled, reaching 354,472 in Q3 alone. Key factors contributing to BGB's growth in 2023 include utility benefits on the Bitget platform (fee discounts, voting rights, and exclusive features), strong ecosystem development through initiatives like the EmpowerX Fund and Web3 Fund, and the overall market recovery in the crypto space during the latter part of the year. 2023 marked a notable year for BGB and other exchange tokens,showcasing resilience and potential.

Pepe is arguably the most famous meme of all time. The happy go lucky frog has been reaching every corner of the earth since 2005 thanks to the brilliant artist Matt Furie and memers world wide! The Pepe Community aims to emulate Matt Furie‚Äôs original vision of ‚Äúhardcore happy‚Äù Pepe and wants to provide a safe space for people to invest in the meme. 

The Pepe Community token is fully audited by Certik and has a built in burn function in its fully renounced smart contract. This function burns 0.025% of the Pepe tokens in the liquidity pool without using taxes every 2 hours until the end of time. This means that with our finite supply of 1billion coins, we are the one, if not the only deflationary meme coin in existence.
Over the last 4months we have burned 17% of our supply which has a $ value of 280k USD. The current circulating supply is now only 830 million üî•

Our time is inevitable as nobody owns our contract, and our liquidity is burned into the ether. With our deflationary nature, supply and demand will take over üíØ

More people are now attracted to minting new tokens just by inscribing on a blockchain network and has provided a whole new world of earning more income from the crypto space with little fee. Imagine minting a token for a fee as low as $20 before making as much as $1,000 after listing if all goes well just like what it used to be like in the early days of NFT creation and listing. 

AVAV - an ASC-20 token, however is fast becoming the most popular inscription on Avalanche network with inscription temporarily halted atm to control the price as it continues to be listed across exchanges like LBank and Bitmart with Bitget also scheduled to list the token after meeting liquidity.

Best DePIN projects,8,193w8ba,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/193w8ba/best_depin_projects/,44,"
With the next bull-run around the corner, I feel like DePIN (Decentralised Physical Infrastructure) will be the darling category. Every other category has the stigma of being magic internet money made up of only ones and zeros. But DePIN projects have physical, tangible assets that you can hold and point to as something that exists in the real world. DePIN will appeal to traditional stockmarket investors and act as the bridge between investing in real world assets and digital assets.



With that in mind, what‚Äôs your favourite DePIN project and if you could, please share info such as:


1. real-world problem it solves


2. the physical assets that exist


3. non-crypto partnerships (real-world companies that see value in crypto projects), and any other stats such as


4. buyback / burn details


5. number of users


6. market cap


7. token price


7. circulating supply etc.



My personal pick for top project is World Mobile Token


Real-World Problem: 40% of earth‚Äôs population still have ZERO internet access. Therefore, ZERO access to education, healthcare & financial services and limited access to a better life. Telecomms is a $3 Trillion industry. There are currently 1000 Mobile Network Operators servicing half the world. But they leave the rest of the world untouched because they have deemed it financially unviable to develop infrastructure in remote areas. World Mobile, however, have to team, the tech and the Sharing Economy Business Model (this part is key) to deliver twice the speeds at half the price. And before you say it, Starlink is not cheap and is internet only (see Elon‚Äôs most recent tweet about this), whereas World Mobile is more like a AT&T/Vodafone/T-Mobile type organisation. However, World Mobile does work with Starlink for their backhaul services. World Mobile plans to Connect the Unconnected (1 billion by 2030).

 

Physical Assets

Aerostat: Their biggest physical asset just launched in Mozambique (with many more in the pipeline). The World Mobile Aerostat is essentially a blimp that is tethered to the ground. It hovers at 300 metres and provides internet access to everyone within a 75km radius. Other physical assets include:
Air Nodes (many variations and sizes, but picture a box with an antenna connected to a pole with solar panels at the top and rechargeable batteries at the bottom),
Earth Nodes (computer that validates transactions on the blockchain) and
Aether Nodes (the bridge between legacy telco and World Mobile infrastructure, typically one per country).
 

Partnerships

Vodacom (part of the Vodafone Group) partnership was just announced on 20th December 2023. The Aerostat was launched in partnership with World Mobile. You can google and see the Vodcaom logo on the side of the blimp.
Fulham FC: World Mobile Logo on sleeves of the 11th ranked English Premier League football team
Epson: partnering to bring education to underserved communities (internet, computers, projectors and printers)
 

Stats (from www.wmtscan.com)

Users: 51,000
Average revenue per user: $1.50 per month in Africa, $55 per month in USA
Buyback: 18% revenue is used to buy WMT off exchanges every week  (most recently US$4,213 / 30,094 WMT)
Total buybacks since May 2023: 591,214 WMT = US$74,197 at current price of $0.1255
Locations: Zanzibar (659 Air Nodes), Pakistan (circa 571 Air Nodes), USA (Reno, 5), Mozambique (1 Aerostat)
Air Nodes: 1235 currently shown on www.wmtscan.com
Earth Nodes: maximum 1000
Market Cap: $65M
Price: $0.1255
Circulating Supply: 519M
 

Forget 1 billion users by 2030. Imagine 1 million users. If US$4,357 is being bought weekly with only 57,000 users (at ARPU $1.50 per month, not the higher $55 in USA yet), we can extrapolate to 1 million users and expect US$76,000 per week being bought back. Imagine the buy pressure without even factoring investors. This is how we get mass adoption of crypto. Users using blockchain without knowing it.

Boasting over 200% market cap growth, surging from below $300 million to $800 million by December 28th, BGB defied bear market trends, setting new all-time highs. In comparison, BNB and OKB experienced modest growth, while KCS remained stagnant. BGB's success is attributed to strategic innovation, aggressive utility expansion, and robust community engagement.

How a protocol develops innovative and robust technology and collaborates with other industry leaders to form strong ecosystem products is also important. 

Two emerging trends in the blockchain and web3 space in 2023 have been privacy and AI applicability in use cases like DeFi. So, when [Oasis and Ocean came together](https://oasisprotocol.org/blog/ocean-predictoor-on-sapphire) on the sidelines of SmartCon Barcelona, Sapphire-supported Predictoor became the result.

Ocean Predictoor is an AI-powered dApp making and verifying prediction feeds where individuals can submit predictions, stake on these predictions, and accordingly get rewarded. It requires end-to-end privacy and confidentiality solutions on three levels:

* Individuals data privacy for the user-submitted data
* Confidential computation on the data
* Customized privacy settings so that the computed results of the data get shared only with specific parties and only under specific conditions.

As the only privacy-preserving EVM chain in production, Oasis Sapphire's smart privacy is the ideal technology to implement the solution. Oasis and Ocean also incentivize [data farming](https://oasisprotocol.org/blog/oasis-ocean-predictoor-data-farming) similar to DeFi liquidity mining where predictions with the highest accuracy and lowest error get rewarded. Oasis allocated 400k ROSE for the incentive program that awards users weekly. The program was recently extended acknowledging its popularity among the users and the new end date is January 4. 

Have you tried Predictoor which is fun and safe to use while offering sizeable rewards? If not, make sure not to miss out on the final week of the incentive program because privacy-assured AI prediction is all set to be one of the most exciting and rewarding DeFi experiences of the future.",2023-12-29 06:25:39,1703852739.0

My doubts:

1. All of this can be a waste of time: Only 9 hours in three years.  
2. It's a scam: I haven't spent a penny.  
3. They're generating ad revenue from the users: You can turn it off. A project needs to generate some money for the development. I literally get only one ad when I tap mine and that's it. Not riddled with annoying ads.

Here are my top altcoin picks for next year,41,18lyu7m,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/18lyu7m/here_are_my_top_altcoin_picks_for_next_year/,83," As you can see, there is a high chance of having a bull run soon, as BTC has shown a good price move to the upside for several months now. IMO, it's wise to start accumulating gradually.  

But the real question is what to buy and why I think it‚Äôs the best option. I will only be listing the two tokens I‚Äôm accumulating now. One is a large cap, and the other is a low cap. Both are my biggest bags, and if you do proper research, you will agree with me that they have a high chance of leading the next bull run.  

The first is SOLANA; it's funny because I personally FUD SOL a few months ago before it had that huge price move back up. Recently, I have noticed SOL has started gaining a lot of traction, and memecoin is now gradually shifting from ETH to the Solana ecosystem. If this trend continues, then a lot of people will end up buying into SOL, and I predict the price will be around $500 for its next ATH.   

The second, which is a low-MC gem and is gradually gaining traction, is QANX. It‚Äôs a layer 1 hybrid blockchain that is EVM-compatible. One of the features about it that I feel will blow up so much is the fact that it allows developers to code smart contracts in any programming language, which QAN aims to use to onboard over 20 million developers into the blockchain, which I believe even If they are able to achieve 10% of that, then this layer 1 blockchain will be greater than ETH. And my price prediction for QANX is $1 in the next bull run.  

Anyway, please feel free to share with me what altcoins you are buying as well.

The Crypto Listing Paradox: The struggle for all Small Crypto Projects and How to Prevail.,1,18lxwic,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/18lxwic/the_crypto_listing_paradox_the_struggle_for_all/,1,">**The Crypto Listing Paradox: The struggle for all Small Crypto Projects and How to Prevail.**

In the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, gaining a listing on a centralized exchange (CEX) can be a pivotal moment for any project, opening doors to liquidity, exposure, and potential growth. However, for small crypto projects, this journey comes with a paradoxical perverse challenge ‚Äì the Crypto Listing Paradox.

*‚ÄúThe business model of centralized exchanges as we know today, encourages fraud and project failure.‚Äù*

CEXs, often regarded as gatekeepers to broader market participation, present a complex set of requirements for projects seeking a listing. While these platforms can significantly boost a project‚Äôs credibility, the demands placed on small crypto projects, with a small marketcap, can be financially frightening. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the challenges faced by these projects:

1. **Listing Fees:** CEXs typically require projects to pay substantial listing fees (up to $500.000), acting as a barrier to entry. For smaller projects with limited resources, this initial financial burden can hinder their chances of securing a listing. So CEXs will let those projects pay with their own tokens. After the project gets listed, the tokens are being dumped by the CEX to pay for the fee and the token price plummets. Leaving the crypto community and the project with bags full of sand.
2. **Market Maker:** Beyond listing fees, CEXs may recommend or mandate projects to engage market makers to enhance liquidity. This adds another layer of cost, as market makers often charge fees for their services.
3. **Marketing Campaigns:** To stand out in the competitive crypto landscape, projects are often asked to invest in marketing campaigns like trading competitions. This expenditure, while potentially beneficial for exposure, poses a challenge for projects operating on tight budgets.
4. **Community Engagement:** CEXs expect projects to bring in traders from their own community. This requires active participation and engagement, putting the onus on project teams to foster a vibrant and involved user base. This often results in buying fake followers and pumping fake volume to meet the CEXs requirements.
5. **Volume Maintenance:** Maintaining a high trading volume is crucial for remaining listed on a CEX. Failure to do so can lead to delisting, resulting in the loss of funds invested in the listing process.

The paradox lies in the fact that the only way to avoid paying exorbitant listing fees for listing a token on a CEX is, to already be a sizable project.Which only seem to be achieved by being listed on a CEX. Paying exorbitant listing fees is a risk that always reflects back to the crypto community.This Catch-22 situation creates a perverse challenge for small crypto projects striving to gain visibility, traction **and protecting their community.** These things cannot possibly go together.

However, there is hope. The crypto community plays a vital role in breaking this paradox. Collective action, even in small doses, can significantly impact a project‚Äôs trajectory. A few minutes of engagement each day, whether through group messages, tweets, retweets, or comments on influential accounts, can contribute to building the necessary momentum.

While the Crypto Listing Paradox poses a significant hurdle for small crypto projects, community support and active engagement can be powerful tools for overcoming these challenges. By fostering a collaborative spirit within the crypto space, we can help promising projects defy the odds and thrive in the ever-evolving landscape of digital assets.

Justmoney‚Äôs decentralized cryptocurrency platform, [just.money 1](https://just.money/) on Polygon, Ethereum, Tron, Binance Chain, and BTTC addresses the Crypto Listing Paradox by providing a cost-effective defi platform. It offers projects an opportunity to list tokens free of charge across multiple blockchains, within a fast growing decentralized crypto ecosystem that goes beyond the limitations of traditional centralized exchanges. Here is how:

1. Projects or tokenholders can provide liquidity that can be redeemed anytime.
2. Providing liquidity the liquidity provider earns 83,30% of the trading fees from the platform.

*For example: the annual interest on the JM/USDT pool on Binance Smart Chain is at the time of writing, over 12%.*

1. The other part of the fee (16,70%) is being used to maintain the platform.
2. The JustMoney Suite for small crypto projects comes with an Automated Market Maker, a Payment Terminal, an Invoicing System and many more tools.
3. All services are free of charge but financed by each transaction.

*‚ÄúThis business model is much more sustainable than current business models of the traditional centralized exchanges.‚Äù*

The recent partnership between [TheManeToken 1](https://x.com/TheManeToken?t=tbAdgiS60Fc6WaKg6B70tQ&s=09) and [JustMoney](https://x.com/JustMoneyIO?t=9YHn8Qd2IkC4qij__IePkQ&s=09) can tackle the Crypto Listing Paradox by leveraging Mane Token‚Äôs marketing expertise. Mane Token‚Äôs strategic campaigns and engaged community can enhance visibility for projects on Justmoney, fostering cross-promotion and addressing B2B needs. With Justmoney‚Äôs presence on multiple blockchains, the collaboration aims for sustained ecosystem growth, offering a decentralized and sustainable alternative to traditional exchange listings and marketing campaigns.

Coinbase MicroCap with 100x potential. Gauging interest before I post more üëÄ,6,18lqyq0,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/18lqyq0/coinbase_microcap_with_100x_potential_gauging/,12,"Just joined the group so I‚Äôm not willing to share all my secrets yet, but curious if anyone is interested in a micro cap gem listed on CB with 100x potential?

I‚Äôve been sitting on what I believe to be a hidden üíé for the last 2 years. 

For all of those who may or may not have heard of it (you likely haven‚Äôt) the coin is called SUKU.

Until more interest is gauged, the TLDR is;

It‚Äôs ran by Deloittes former blockchain team.

It‚Äôs been a company for 5+ years verifiable on LinkedIn with dozens of employees.

They have a wallet with over 100k users, and are currently expanding partnerships and products to help support mass adoption of web3 tech.

Their core products integrate directly to social media, specifically Twitter (for now).

All of this and a sub 10MM market cap today. Available on Coinbase and Kucoin, and possibly Binance soon. 

Happy to share more of my research, but these are the starting points to see how many others care before I type up essays.

Much love, please comment if you‚Äôd like to discuss further.

Tremendous arbitrage opportunity for professional traders on the BCHG fund. Pro traders can hedge and pocket the huge arbitrage premium. Subject to risks of course.,3,18dqrs1,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/18dqrs1/tremendous_arbitrage_opportunity_for_professional/,0,"

&#x200B;

Currently the BCHG fund is trading at $432-$470 per BCH while BCH is actually trading at $250 on spot markets.

This represents up to a 88% premium above spot market prices, which is the max the BCHG can even be worth (NAV value) once they open redemptions, when they convert it to an ETF.

So arbitrage can be done, by borrowing BCHG, shorting it, then buying spot of an equal amount of BCH to hedge the underlying assets, while pocketing the premium only. Eg.

1 ) sell 1 BCH worth of BCHG for $470.

2) Buy 1 BCH on spot for $250

3) Pay interest on the BCHG loan until the premium disappears.

4) Buy back the short when the price is nearly equal to spot, it could be at any price, so if BCHG rate goes to $250 and BCH is $250, buy back the short and sell spot and you profit $220  minus fees and interest.

Disclaimer: This requires advanced skill and knowledge of brokerages so only try this if you know what you are doing as this is not trading advice but speculation on what the heck is going on with BCHG crazy NAV premium.

Good luck.",2023-12-08 10:37:47,1702053467.0
RWA done right - Landshare,3,18dgfuv,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/18dgfuv/rwa_done_right_landshare/,6,"Landshare is set to lead the Real World Asset narrative. Solid project / professional team. 

They tokenize real estate and you can invest in their property portfolio and get paid monthly rental yields and property appreciation. It‚Äôs literally a one of its kind project. 

The native utility token of the project $LAND only has a 10 million max supply. And every time some purchases the RWA token (the property portfolio token for the project) 10% of the purchase is made in $LAND and that is subsequently burned. So it‚Äôs a truly deflationary token will already low supply. 

There are plans to take the project multi chain to polygon + possibly Ethereum. 

Also new exchange listings are on their way.

Fan Favorite - It allows token holders to vote on their top player of the game. This could totally change the way Player of The Game/Week/Year is selected in the future.


Auctions - Goal scoring balls, signed jeries and other items can be purchased via online auction and you don‚Äôt have to worry about authenticity. Way less friction than what we previously had.


Special treatment for token holders - There are clear incentives to hold or own fan tokens of your favorite clubs. They can give you extra benefits during games and let you participate in a lot of special events organized by the clubs. Considering that most other tokens are pure speculation this is a huge upgrade.

What is a Hard Fork?,16,183qh2g,altcoin,https://i.redd.it/hnibwq2whj2c1.jpg,5,"Blockchain technology is changing how we think about data, security, and decentralized systems in a world where technology is advancing rapidly.

At its core, blockchain is a secure and transparent way to record transactions across multiple computers, ensuring that each entry is immutable and verifiable.

Blockchain is constantly evolving, and one important concept is a ‚Äúhard fork.‚Äù

A hard fork is a significant change or upgrade in the blockchain world that requires all users and nodes who support it to upgrade to the new version to continue participating in the issuer‚Äôs vision of a new network.

Users who do not agree with the new vision, or just wish to remain on the old network are free to do so by simply not upgrading to the new version.

The Qtum Foundation developers can‚Äôt directly control the network. There are no back doors or hidden switches used to pause the network or blacklist addresses.

We rely on community confidence to support our updates, and users do this by upgrading their nodes.

Once the majority of nodes are upgraded to version 24.1, the hard fork should succeed.

At the time of this article‚Äôs writing, over 70% of the nodes (and biggest service providers) are reporting version 24.1, so the hard fork is likely to happen without problems.

Greetings! In this month's report, we'll walk  you through our achievements, which range from enhancing the  reliability of our core features to gearing up for the impending Zarcanum hardfork. Here's a comprehensive overview of our progress:

**Ionic Swaps and Automated Testing:**

* Our QA team has conducted extensive manual testing of Ionic swaps.
* During testing, an issue was discovered, leading us to create several core tests to identify and address it.
* By the end of the testing cycle, all issues were successfully fixed and covered by automated tests.

**Compatibility with Modern GCC Versions:**

* We  resolved a critical problem where Zano could not be built using GCC  versions greater than 8.3, a common occurrence in the latest Ubuntu  releases.
* The fix and an updated build manual have been  implemented in the 'develop' branch and are scheduled for merging into  the master branch in the next release.

**Enhancing Anonymity:**

* We've  implemented decoy support for old-style, non-anonymous, pre-Zarcanum  Proof-of-Stake (PoS) to enhance transactional anonymity until the  Zarcanum hardfork is activated.

**Preparing for Zarcanum Hardfork:**

* To  ensure a seamless transition with the upcoming privacy update, we  performed a significant merge of the old codebase with various ad-hoc  fixes into a separate branch dedicated to the Zarcanum hardfork.
* This merged code is now undergoing extensive testing to guarantee compatibility with the existing blockchain.

**Governance Implementation:**

* We've  successfully implemented governance, a crucial step in enhancing  community involvement and decision-making within the Zano ecosystem.

**Cake Wallet Integration:**

* Our ongoing efforts include the integration of Cake Wallet, which is currently in progress.

**Block Explorer Upgrade:**

* As  part of our hardfork preparation, we've upgraded the block explorer to  work seamlessly with both pre-Zarcanum and post-Zarcanum states.

We're committed to advancing Zano's functionality, security, and privacy, and  we're excited about the developments on the horizon. Your continued  support is invaluable, and we look forward to sharing more updates with  you soon!

Get to know Qtum: The Basics,2,17gcclh,altcoin,https://i.redd.it/lvilhc1ucewb1.jpg,1,"Qtum is a blockchain platform that merges the advantages of Bitcoin‚Äôs UTXO blockchain design and Ethereum‚Äôs Smart Contract functionality.

This combination enables users to create, manage, and engage in blockchain services and products efficiently.
Let‚Äôs explore the unique features and inner workings that make Qtum a notable player in the blockchain sector.

History of Qtum

In September 2017, Qtum‚Äôs main network came to life, marking a significant milestone in the blockchain‚Äôs history. Over the course of six years, the Qtum core team has tirelessly worked on enhancing the platform, with more than 40 wallet releases to their name.
Some notable updates include:

The Decentralized Governance Protocol allows the community to increase the block size up to 8000kb and adjust gas fees on demand.

32-second block targeting and Segregated Witness for higher throughput.

Proof-of-Stake consensus model.

Taproot and EVM one updates to the Ethereum Virtual Machine.

Qtum core codebase updated to keep up with all BIPs offered with the latest Bitcoin Core release.

Qtum‚Äôs ‚ÄúAccount Abstraction Layer‚Äù which allows the UTXO model to host the Ethereum Virtual Machine without needing an Ethereum blockchain clone.

Implementation of popular ERC standards like ERC20, ERC1155, ERC721, etc.
Their efforts have focused on increasing blockchain speed while ensuring that the code remains in sync with the latest developments from Bitcoin Core and Ethereum.

Since its inception in 2015, Qtum‚Äôs mission has been to create a blockchain that blends the battle-tested stability of Bitcoin Core‚Äôs UTXO model with the capabilities of smart contracts on a decentralized Proof-of-Stake mechanism. This unique recipe has proven its relevance over the years.
One of Qtum‚Äôs notable achievements in the realm of scalability is the introduction of smart contracts that allow the community to adjust gas fees and block sizes.

This innovation, known as the ‚ÄúDecentralized Governance Protocol,‚Äù has made Qtum faster than both Ethereum and Bitcoin without compromising decentralization.

Decentralization remains a core concern for the Qtum team, especially in a landscape where high throughput often takes precedence.

Their perspective is clear: true mass adoption necessitates a strong foundation of decentralization on the base layer, with layer 2 solutions catering to the need for ‚Äúmillions to billions‚Äù of transactions.

Uses of QTUM Token

The purpose of the Qtum token is to pay for gas on the Qtum network and to secure the network through the Proof-of-Stake model. Any other use of the Qtum token is merely speculation on secondary market price action.

The Qtum network requires a token cost to send coins. If there wasn‚Äôt a cost associated with a transaction, anyone could create a looped transaction between two or more wallet addresses and effectively kill the blockchain with spam transactions.

This is exactly why there‚Äôs a gas fee, and the only purpose of the Qtum token is to pay that fee. This doesn‚Äôt mean the Qtum network‚Äôs only capability is to send and receive tokens. This applies to smart contracts as well.

Qtum tokens are also required to solve blocks, also known as staking, which secures the blockchain.

Qtum Strikes the Perfect Balance: The Blockchain Trilemma,15,17bpyp0,altcoin,https://i.redd.it/v87ziav0d7vb1.jpg,6,"The landscape of blockchain technology is constantly evolving, driven by the desire for innovation. Three critical factors that are considered among the many challenges faced by blockchain networks are scalability, security, and decentralization.

In this article, we will delve into the evolving world of blockchain technology, explore the crucial importance of achieving the right balance between scalability, security, and decentralization, and highlight Qtum‚Äôs groundbreaking approach to addressing this challenge.

The blockchain technology landscape has undergone significant changes since the launch of Bitcoin in 2008. With the exception of meme coins, nearly every project launched in the years following Bitcoin‚Äôs debut has attempted to enhance and expand the ecosystem‚Äôs capabilities.
Achieving a balance between scalability, security, and decentralization has been challenging. The concept of ‚Äúscalability trilemma‚Äù was first introduced by Vitalik Buterin in 2021: Why sharding is great: demystifying the technical properties (vitalik.ca)

The Blockchain Trilemma
The trilemma lies at the core of blockchain design. It proposes that any network must make a trade-off between three essential properties: decentralization, scalability, and security.

These three properties can be visualized as the points of a triangle, and a network must choose to prioritize one side of this triangle. In other words, a network that emphasizes security and decentralization will have to compromise on scalability and vice versa.
To give an example, let‚Äôs take Bitcoin. Its founder, Satoshi Nakamoto, prioritized security and decentralization, leading to the implementation of the Proof-of-Work (PoW) algorithm.
However, this decision resulted in a very low transaction processing rate of about 7 transactions per second (TPS).
On the other hand, centralized networks like Visa offer high security and can handle over 65,000 TPS. Nevertheless, they compromise on decentralization.

This compromise has been a significant point of disagreement in the blockchain world.

Why have so few altcoins ended their reliance on AWS? It's not like the tech isn't there that makes it easy.,4,17b27j7,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/17b27j7/why_have_so_few_altcoins_ended_their_reliance_on/,4,"There is a new attack on some shitcoin's frontend every month and they can be taken down with just a strongly worded letter from a government agency. So why aren't the devs doing something to mitigate that risk and become more antifragile?

Then there are the centralized backends where the dev ops take place, authorization keys are managed, and the costs of instances is high. Why aren't devs interested in improving this?

It's not like the infra hasn't been developed that makes it easy. Projects don't even have to build on the Internet Computer, move to a layer 2, bridge coins, sacrifice speed or privacy, or do much leg work at all really. They literally just have to use Oyster and both the frontend and backends are no longer hosted on a server. The biggest single point of failure would be taken care of.

Frontends with Oyster:

* Less vulnerable to exploits
* Server farms blowing up have no effect
* The UI everyone uses can't be seized

Backends with Oyster:

* Allows DAOs to focus on their mission rather than DevOps
* No authorization keys to manage
* Cost of instances is decreased by dividing them amongst users who are only charged by their personal consumption.
* Improves security by providing a secure execution environment for sensitive workloads via Oyster enclaves.

Oyster is an open platform that allows developers to deploy custom computational tasks or services over untrusted third-party hosts. These enclaves ensure that neither the host nor any other application running in it can snoop into data or alter the integrity of computations that occur inside the Tee. Oyster has persistent storage, Open source SDK & frameworks, monitoring and auto-scaling, https support, reproducible builds, and enables serverless deployment. Oyster uses Intel SGX and AMD SEV.

Oyster even has zk proof use cases that essentially enables hardware acceleration by routing the computations to a secondary market of GPUs, ASICs, and FPGAs.

It's the best kept secret in crypto (works for web2 projects too) and I think if devs started to get interested in it Marlin Protocol would go on another run like it did last cycle. Oyster was developed by Marlin.

"Privacy Conversation to Redefine Web3 As We Know It, and Altcoins by Extension",4,172462f,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/172462f/privacy_conversation_to_redefine_web3_as_we_know/,21,"All of us frequenting here know something about altcoins and crypto tokens. How many agree that privacy has a crucial role to play in taking web3 forward and boosting mainstream adoption? I think everyone. 

However, privacy has been a long-standing pain point for the blockchain space as its core tenets of decentralization and transparency can often end up undermining security. But with such innovative and transformative technology in operation can a solution be far behind? The emergence of various privacy-preserving techniques says the days of the [blockchain privacy paradox](https://oasisprotocol.org/blog/demystify-the-blockchain-privacy-paradox-how-oasis-solves-this) are all but over.

How many here know of or heard about the [UPA](https://privacyalliance.com/) (Universal Privacy Alliance)? Sadly, the number is very few. UPA is a coming together of major organizations championing privacy preservation as a shared goal. The significance of this alliance is that while the techniques used may vary, the single purpose of confidential computations is carried out as the backbone of all web3 operations. Result: end users like most of us, without being even aware of it, can enjoy the benefits of privacy as we interact with and experience the web3 in a better, safer way. 

One of the major players in the UPA is the Oasis Foundation. It works the blockchain space as the Oasis Network - a layer-1, scalable, protocol committed to helping build the next-gen web3 with smart privacy. Its vision ensures user data sovereignty and protection. 

Oasis uses trusted execution environments (TEEs) for confidential computations. This not only has [multiple advantages](https://oasisprotocol.org/blog/comparing-zkp-tee-privacy) over the next-popular methodology - zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) but can also be used together in combination. The flagship technology of Oasis is Sapphire, the industry's first-ever confidential EVM. It also powers a cross-chain tool, OPL (Oasis Privacy Layer) enabling other EVM web3 dApps to leverage its smart privacy capabilities. The sky seems the limit when it comes to [what can be built](https://oasisprotocol.org/blog/what-to-build-on-oasis) on Oasis. Let's take an example - DeFi.

Oasis has long been a major advocate of [protecting users from MEV exploits](https://oasisprotocol.org/blog/web3-mev-protection). Its smart privacy solutions make MEV-resistant functionalities an in-built feature of the next-gen DeFi dApps such as illumineX, the first-ever [confidential DEX](https://oasisprotocol.org/blog/illuminex-grant-sapphire-dex), being developed on Oasis Sapphire. Not only that, Oasis is also [partnering with Synthr](https://oasisprotocol.org/blog/syrose-launch-synthr-partnership) to bring out a synthetic version of its native token, [Rose](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/oasis-network/). Styled as syROSE, it will be available from Q4 offering omnichain liquidity solutions for illumineX users. Another major development on the smart privacy-enabled DeFi front is [Ocean Predictoor](https://oasisprotocol.org/blog/ocean-predictoor-on-sapphire) \- an AI prediction dApp.

There is no argument that the role of privacy will only become more and more significant as we progress toward a greater web3 future. And altcoins like Oasis that put privacy as a priority while expanding the dApp ecosystem are going to be the architects shaping that future.",2023-10-07 06:30:36,1696678236.0
Proof of stake explained: Why is it better than Bitcoin‚Äôs PoW?,12,16z000d,altcoin,https://i.redd.it/rs4cv99t91sb1.jpg,6,"As the popularity of cryptocurrency continues to grow, it‚Äôs important to consider the environmental impact of these digital currencies.

One of the most well-known cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin, uses a system called Proof of Work (PoW), which requires miners to solve complex mathematical equations to publish new blocks. This process consumes a significant amount of electricity, contributing to the carbon footprint of the currency.

However, there is hope for a more sustainable future for cryptocurrency. Proof of Stake (PoS) is a newer system that requires users to hold a certain amount of cryptocurrency to validate transactions. This reduces the system‚Äôs energy consumption and makes it a more environmentally friendly choice.

A Tale of Two Systems: PoW vs. PoS

Imagine a vast gold mine where hundreds of miners tirelessly dig, not knowing if they‚Äôll find gold or not.

This is the world of Proof of Work ‚Äî a competitive frenzy where participants, or miners, solve complex mathematical problems to publish a new block containing the latest record transactions

The first to solve the problem wins the block reward and publishes the new block, but the combined energy of all those participants, most of whom leave empty-handed, is immense.

Now, multiply that image by thousands ‚Äî representing all the miners worldwide ‚Äî and you can visualize the scale of energy consumption.

I think (obviously) that this has huge potential. We've seen massive rises in the use and value of BRICKs, MOONs, and now DONUTs. And coingecko has a new category for Reddit tokens: [https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/reddit-points](https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/reddit-points) (Currently #69!)

Ok...

It seems that the Reddit Community points are still a ways away based on their doc and [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/community-points/documentation/faqs). And I've been searching but keep coming back to REDDIT token itself as an interesting conundrum. It launched in May, ran up, came up, ran up again in June/July, and now is sitting at around $100K market cap. Wish I had spotted this one back when it launched! I can't get it out of my head because all of the community tokens shot up from sub-penny prices (maybe except Fortnite, which went to $0.35). 

I wonder if there's a way to purpose this token as either a proxy or de facto substitute for community rewards. Or when Reddit comes out with their official rollout, what's gonna happen to REDDIT token.

I couldn't find any prior posts on this coin here except this very old post calling for Reddit karma coins.

Choosing between the UTXO Model and the Accounts Model,3,16n0zhm,altcoin,https://i.redd.it/183yvjqkr9pb1.jpg,7,"When the Qtum team set out to build a new blockchain, they faced a strategic decision that would impact everything from security protocols to scalability and application support. 

They weighed factors like long-term viability and user needs and had to understand the UTXO and Accounts models to achieve their vision.

Thanks to their hard work and careful planning, they revolutionized digital transactions and decentralized applications with a powerful and flexible blockchain.

The UTXO Model

The UTXO model is the foundational architecture behind the Bitcoin blockchain. Transactions are viewed as outputs from previous transactions that have not been spent.

These outputs are indivisible, meaning they are either spent in their entirety or not at all.

The UTXO model‚Äôs binary nature significantly impacts blockchain security and integrity. Once a transaction is confirmed and added to the blockchain, it becomes part of the immutable ledger.

With over 40 wallet releases, the Qtum core team has improved the speed of the blockchain while keeping the code upstream with the latest developments from Bitcoin Core and Ethereum.

As we look ahead, the Qtum team will focus on Ordinals support and other ways to improve the third-party developer experience with our v24.1 hard fork in late 2023.

When the Qtum team began this journey back in 2015, we envisioned a blockchain that would retain the battle-hardened stability of Bitcoin Core‚Äôs UTXO model while offering smart contract functionality on a decentralized Proof-of-Stake mechanism.

This recipe has been surprisingly relevant over the years. Even on scalability, the Qtum team deployed a set of smart contracts that would allow the community to adjust the gas fee and block size and dubbed this the ‚ÄúDecentralized Governance Protocol.‚Äù This effectively made Qtum faster than Ethereum or Bitcoin without sacrificing decentralization.

Findora Launches Game-Specific Chains with zkGaming SDK,2,15tdq8k,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/15tdq8k/findora_launches_gamespecific_chains_with/,6,"Findora ($FRA) recently announced they launched Game-Specific Chains; subnets on Findora that include a zkGaming SDK (more below), a 2-second block time, and transaction fees of 0.02 FRA. 

The zkGaming SDK allows for game mechanics like in-game assets that are held private until a specific situation calls for that data to be revealed (ex: hiding on-chain battle card stats until the round begins).

CMC: [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/findora/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/findora/)

\+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

**More details on the GSCs below taken off their announcement article.**

## Two Second Blocktimes ‚Äì or faster

Preventing latency through fast block times is essential for Web3 gamers to keep their experience fun. Findora‚Äôs first GSC spun up for Ender‚Äôs Gate features 2-second block times, but GSC block times have been tested to as low as 30 milliseconds. Developers who want to spin up their own GSC can choose their own validators and a block time that will work for them.

## Built-in ZkGaming

GSCs come with FIndora's [zkGaming SDK](https://github.com/FindoraNetwork/zkcard-mini-sdk) that empowers developers to build games that require on-chain shuffling or hidden state data. VRFs (variable random functions) are a gaming primitive, but their outputs are public, like dice rolls. On-chain games require more than just a randomization function; they also require private shuffling and hidden cards. For example, poker on an open ledger would be pretty pointless since everyone would know each others‚Äô hands. zkShuffling is a function that can keep state data private until the right moment enabling all kinds of new games.

&#x200B;

[Findora Game Specific Chains](https://preview.redd.it/0q2k8ki4ulib1.png?width=2200&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf8da926f860be5289fd868d071e8171dc40f24f)

## Launch Partner - Enders Gate

The first project to launch a GSC instance is Enders Gate. Enders Gate is a trading card game where users can purchase NFT decks of on-chain cards. Once you‚Äôve purchased or built a deck, challenge other players to turn-based strategy battles. Each deck you purchase is stuffed with characters with unique characters and abilities. You‚Äôll also be able to purchase power-ups using in-game gold from an in-game store.

&#x200B;

[Enders Gate](https://i.redd.it/2so78ugttlib1.gif)

## EVM compatible

GSCs, like Findora, are EVM compatible, meaning Solidity developers can easily build games on them. By simply calling functions from the SDK, they can use zk-functions without learning Rust or another programming language.

&#x200B;

* **Verifiably Random and Fair**
   * The random function can be verified using zk-proofs so that all players can be assured they are playing on equal footing and gameplay is fair.

## Modular Architecture

GSCs are modular subnets, meaning that the consensus, virtual machine, and execution layers can be customized based on the community's needs. For example, the consensus module could be switched from Tendermint to Hostfuff or Overlord. It‚Äôs also possible to use a different virtual machine that isn‚Äôt an EVM. GSC‚Äôs zk components are also customizable, with some configurations reaching over 2,000 TPS.",2023-08-17 00:16:38,1692249398.0

Find out how Qtum's Proof-of-Stake works,14,15sy46w,altcoin,https://i.redd.it/xcyvujcfoiib1.jpg,7,"Qtum is a unique hybrid blockchain platform that combines the strengths of Bitcoin's Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) model and Ethereum's smart contract functionality.

It aims to offer a secure and scalable infrastructure for developers to create decentralized applications and smart contracts.

Explanation of Proof of Stake (PoS)

Proof of Stake (PoS) is a consensus mechanism used in blockchain networks to validate transactions and create new blocks.

Unlike Proof of Work (PoW), which requires miners to solve complex mathematical problems, PoS selects validators based on the number of coins they hold and are willing to 'stake' as collateral.

Comparison of PoS with Proof of Work (PoW)

While PoW ensures network security through computational work, PoS achieves the same goal by leveraging economic incentives.

PoS is generally considered more energy-efficient and democratic than PoW, as it allows more participants to validate transactions and earn rewards without needing high-end hardware.

* We're thrilled to present our new Tier System, designed exclusively for AutoTrading! It's simple - more JDB tokens you hold, more rewards you receive, and lesser the trading fees. Let's break it down:

* AutoTrading - Unlimited Possibilities: Forget complicated Telegram bots. We bring you a streamlined UX/UI right in your browser. Set which wallets you want to follow. Define the market cap at which you want your tokens to be automatically sold. Want to sell in increments up to a 100m market cap? Or trigger an auto-sell if the MC falls below a specific level? Our JDB Guard protects you from rug pulls. Fancy copy trading the Most Profitable Wallet which makes $50k profit each month? You got it. The possibilities are endless.

* Rewards - Money Talks: Imagine this - a $3 million monthly turnover from our AutoTrader results in $450,000 going straight back to our community. 

* Development and Expansion: The JDB Autotrader will be expanded step-by-step. The rewards system will be implemented post-launch. Until then, we'll utilize the 15% to perform buybacks. The development of the JDB Autotrader starts tomorrow.

CONTRACT RENOUNCED:  https://etherscan.io/tx/0xc50e78c7c5893684139a16773894da0de19112898d2c9a02c950ccff98f93a87



Dear JDB Community,

We're excited to share some important updates with you! Following a productive team meeting, we've made a series of significant decisions that we believe will revolutionize our journey and bring us closer to our goal of reaching mass adoption.

1. JDB's Goal: Our goal is to have hundreds of thousands of users using the JDB DApp, and we're making sure our platform is more accessible than ever to make this happen.

2. Powerful Base: We have successfully created an incredibly potent base for finding the next 1000x tokens and the most profitable wallets with our JDB DApp. The next stage is to implement an integrated browser-supported auto-trading feature that is unlike anything you've seen before.

In order to achieve this, we are shifting the utility of our token to focus entirely on auto-trading.

* DApp Accessibility: From now on, the DApp will be fully visible and usable without any tokens.

* Token Utility: The utility of the JDB token will now be directly tied to auto-trading:
 -Holding JDB tokens will result in lower trading fees.
 -Holding JDB tokens will entitle you to receive a share of the auto-trading fees as rewards. This means 15% of all trading fees will go to token holders. To put this in context, the most well-known trading bot generates around $4 million in fees per month. 15% of this is $600,000 - reserved exclusively for our token holders.
  -Until the reward system is implemented (which will happen post auto-trading launch), we will use this 15% to perform buybacks.
  -We'll present you the new Tier System in the next few days.

* Token Taxes: We're setting token taxes to 0% effective immediately. This move will increase our trading volume and draw more attention to us.

* Our Vision: With the power of JDB data and auto-trading, we aim to surpass all popular trading bots on the market.

These exciting changes are set to propel us towards our goal of mass adoption and to ensure that JDB remains the most powerful and effective tool for finding and capitalizing on the most profitable tokens and wallets. 

Thank you for being part of this journey with us.

Bullish, don't you agree?   Stay tuned, we're just getting started!

Oasis first introduced a confidential WASM runtime with Cipher and the EVM runtime Emerald. However, enabling privacy for EVM dApps was always the goal, and hence came the industry's first-ever confidential EVM - Sapphire. With smart privacy solutions, Sapphire, using trusted execution environments or TEEs, is a great setup for Solidity developers trying to build the next-gen web3 dApps. But what about those dApps that are already up and running on other EVM networks? How will their privacy needs be answered?

The solution is [OPL](https://oasisprotocol.org/opl) or the Oasis Privacy Layer. With a framework of only a few hundred lines of code, OPL acts as a gateway to privacy for any web3 dApp on any EVM network. It is powered by Sapphire, meaning all the smart privacy solutions are available along with these USPs:

* Customizable privacy - not all dApps require the same levels of privacy. so, OPL offers a full spectrum from fully public to completely confidential.
* Cross-chain convenience - interoperability is a prime feature. the message-passing bridge of OPL is [integrated](https://oasisprotocol.org/blog/celer-messaging-bridge-integration) with Celer's IM framework and seamlessly synchronizes the home network with Sapphire. The whole process takes place without migrating chains where only the confidential computation of the secret state functionalities of the dApp are passed to and fro via signed encrypted messages. Moreover, the transaction fees are payable in the home network's native token via the gas relayer network, so users are not even required to acquire Oasis [tokens](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/oasis-network/) Rose for the gas.

* Productive transparency - making all dApp operations on-chain means full transparency which may seem to be in line with blockchain's tenet of decentralization, is actually counterproductive. so, OPL offers discretionary transparency.

The advantages and utility of OPL as a tool for fostering web3 privacy cannot be overstated. It has applicability potential in DeFi, DAOs, web3 gaming and metaverse, NFTs, etc. [Use cases](https://oasisprotocol.org/blog/opl-features-uses-explainer) in the form of secret ballots, confidential auctions, and private game logic have already been garnering much attention. OPL is committed to making smart privacy a default mode in web3 as it empowers flexible features and functionalities without recourse to being expensive, complex, or rigid. As a Solidity developer, it is a dApp builder's paradise. As an end user, your web3 experience will be better, safer, and more secure as you enjoy data sovereignty with no hidden limitations.",2023-08-05 08:59:06,1691243946.0

Why gaming is taking over nearly half of blockchain transactions,3,15i8nil,altcoin,https://i.redd.it/l2fc5stp55gb1.jpg,2,"Blockchain technology has come a long way since its inception as the backbone of cryptocurrencies.

Today, it is being used to create decentralized applications (dapps) that offer a wide range of benefits, such as transparency, security, and immutability.

One industry that has been quick to embrace blockchain technology is gaming. Blockchain has created new opportunities for gamers and game developers alike.

Read on to explore why gaming is taking over blockchain transactions and what this means for the future of both industries.

The numbers

The latest¬†BGA Game Report by DappRadar¬†reveals that gaming continues to be a significant driving force in the dapp industry, contributing to nearly half of the on-chain activity.
It is remarkable to note that blockchain technology was originally designed for financial transactions, yet gaming has managed to make a significant impact in the space.

The report also highlights that in 2022, an average of 1.13 million Unique Active Wallets connect to game dapps on a daily basis. This figure represents a 60% increase from the previous year, indicating that blockchain gaming is gaining popularity and momentum rapidly.

The Game That Will Change the Way You Play RPGs,3,15fi0zv,altcoin,https://i.redd.it/qqc424yy3jfb1.jpg,1,"Role-Playing Games (RPGs) have long held a special place in the hearts of gamers.

From the early days of text-based adventures to the immersive 3D worlds of today, RPGs have continually evolved, offering players a chance to step into the shoes of a hero, embark on epic quests, and shape their own stories.

But as much as RPGs have changed over the years, a new revolution is on the horizon, promising to redefine the genre in ways we've only begun to imagine.

Here is where we talk about blockchain technology. You've probably heard the buzz about it, especially in the context of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.

And if you are like most gamers, you are very on the fence about it, and there are many reasons why some blockchain games are not it.

But hear us out. Let's start with a clean slate and explain why¬†blockchain is not just crypto and trading.

Blockchain's potential extends far beyond digital currencies. It's a technology that offers unprecedented levels of security, transparency, and decentralization.

Now, imagine an RPG that harnesses the power of blockchain technology. A game where you don't just play a character but genuinely own your in-game assets.

Bridges on BlockWallet,1,15dquym,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/15dquym/bridges_on_blockwallet/,0,"Porting assets from one blockchain to another blockchain comes with a myriad of benefits. First, the blockchain onto which you port assets might be cheaper and faster than its native blockchain. This is certainly true for Ethereum, where high transaction fees and slow throughput make it difficult for newcomers to get involved in decentralized finance (DeFi). Many DeFi protocols have integrated bridges to let their users swap tokens from different protocols without having to leave the platform. This makes the process of converting tokens through bridges less cumbersome.

Users can transfer digital assets across numerous blockchain networks directly from their wallets thanks to the built-in bridge in BlockWallet. It serves as a bridge between two different blockchains, converting one type of digital asset into another that is acceptable by the receiving network.

This solution allows for the convenient transfer of digital assets between networks, bypassing the need for a centralized exchange. This enhances privacy by eliminating the reliance on centralized exchanges that might gather personal information. By facilitating direct asset transfers between blockchain networks, BlockWallet Bridge promotes increased privacy and security for its users.

The presales witnessed overwhelming demand, resulting in both phases being completely sold out, amassing a total of over $250,000 USDT.

With the resounding success of the presales, MaxxChain eagerly looks forward to its upcoming listing on its first centralized exchange (CEX) in August 2023. Investors can anticipate an estimated opening price of $0.012, offering early investors a promising opportunity for growth.

The presale success has limited the available avenues for acquiring $PWR coins before the mainnet launch. Interested individuals can now accumulate $PWR coins by staking $MAXX tokens on BSC and ETH networks. The $MAXX utility tokens, developed and deployed by the Maxx team on the BSC and ETH networks, will also be listed on MaxxChain (paired with $PWR) following the mainnet launch.

The fully diluted pre-mined market cap for $PWR coin is projected to be $12,000,000. However, to enhance the coin's value and attract potential investors, a burn of 60% of the supply is planned shortly after launch. This strategic move will result in a reduced market cap of $4,800,000, amplifying the coin's attractiveness and potential for growth in the market.

MaxxChain's mission is to simplify the crypto space for developers, projects, and users, and as part of their commitment, they will emphasize education for their users while fostering developers and projects in need of assistance.

Allowance Revoke on BlockWallet,2,15865rc,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/15865rc/allowance_revoke_on_blockwallet/,0,"You ought to have complete control over who can access your cryptocurrency because it is valuable.
Therefore, BlockWallet made it simple for you to control your token allocations and decide which DApps can access your money.

The possibility exists that a DApp has been granted unlimited access to your crypto. When you interact with a DApp, You grant the dapp permission to access your wallet when you initially connect your wallet. In this instance, you are allowing the dapp to access your public key and see your wallet balances and activity. You approve your tokens to be used in order to complete a buy or trade. This step is referred to as ‚Äútoken approval‚Äù (or ‚Äútoken allowance‚Äù) because you are allowing the dapp to directly interact with your tokens and complete a transaction.

Token allowances are frequently given in Web3, but it would be a good idea to think about the potential risks.

Some of these risks are:

1. Allowing unlimited access to your funds can leave you exposed to anyone looking to exploit vulnerabilities in DApp codes. 

2. You can be exposed to a phishing scam.

It is important that you take complete control of your token allowances. Regularly revoking unnecessary allowances to clear DApp permissions will reduce the possibility of this happening to you and protect your wallet from scams so you can enjoy Web3 with peace of mind.

BlockWallet has introduced the Allowance Revoke function which makes it easier to secure your crypto. 

The steps are:
1. Click on Settings.
2. Click on Account.
3. Click on Token Allowances.
4. Then you can select which tokens to revoke allowances for.

Stay safe in Web3 with BlockWallet.

Of course, not all of them will have success, but I would like to share some information about upcoming updates from QANplatfrom, which I believe should have huge success!  


I am not going to do a deep dive into some of the tech behind it. Long story short, it will be EVM-compatible and quantum-resistant. One of the strongest selling points is definitely a multi-language feature, which will allow developers to code in any language based on Linux!  


They will have both private and public blockchains, and this is the information I would like to share with everyone. A private blockchain launch should happen in a few weeks, and that could draw more attention to the project. There is one big partnership in the pipeline, but the team never disclosed the name of the partner. They are probably under NDA, but according to the team, it will be someone big.

Following the upcoming hype, I believe this will reflect on the QANX too.  
Since June, the price has been going up gradually. I've made 2.5x until now, but I believe more will come. Considering that Layer 1 has many interesting USPs and their token is sitting on a $40 million market cap, I think anything under 5‚Äì10x before the mainnet launch is undervaluing it.

Phishing Protection on BlockWallet,1,151y6cw,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/151y6cw/phishing_protection_on_blockwallet/,0,"Over time, a lot of crypto traders have fallen victim to scammers. Having vast knowledge and experience in crypto is not a guarantee of safety from scammers. Phishing is a type of cryptocurrency scam that involves tricking victims into giving up their private keys or personal information. It involves a masquerade by the attacker as a legitimate individual or entity to gain the trust of the victim, and collect the non-public keys that provide entry to their wallet to transfer coins to the attacker‚Äôs wallet. 

BlockWallet provides a solution to enable crypto users to stay safe from phishing attacks. Every user of BlockWallet gets a unique generating art for their account, which distinguishes the wallet login from scam attempts. This unique artwork is displayed in all sensitive regions where you need to input your password.


SAFETY TIPS FOR PHISHING PROTECTION

‚Ä¢ Turn on phishing protection in settings. The feature is fully integrated into the wallet, so all that is needed is to keep it on.

‚Ä¢ Memorize and always look for your anti-phishing artwork when entering your password. 

‚Ä¢ Do not share your artwork with anyone. Your artwork is also confidential and private information that should be known to only you.

‚Ä¢ Do not interact with BlockWallet if it does not display your artwork. If you interact with BlockWallet and it does not display your unique anti-phishing artwork, you are likely a victim of a phishing attempt and should avoid using the wallet. Instead, contact the community members on Telegram or Discord for guidance.

It is possible to store and swap tokens without m having to worry about exchanges accessing your personal data. In-wallet swaps on BlockWallet provides solutions to lots of the problems traders face when they use other
means to swap. Some of the benefits you enjoy when you swap your crypto assets on BlockWallet are:


REDUCED SWAP FEES 

BlockWallet took into
consideration, the fact that traders consider wallets to be too expensive. This informed the decision to launch with 0% swap fees, where you just pay gas fee and you are set to swap your tokens. It is worthy of note that BlockWallet swaps have the lowest fees and this puts BlockWallet at the forefront of other crypto wallets.


SIMPLIFIED SWAPS 

There is the reduction of exposure to third-party protocols when you swap on BlockWallet. Thus, there is no need for exchanges and zero wallet connections are required. There are also fewer approvals required.


PRIVACY PROTECTION
Do not forget that BlockWallet is privacy- first. Not all swapping platforms offer privacy and security. Some platforms makes the details of all
transactions visible to the public which impairs user privacy, but BlockWallet gives the user complete privacy.

OPL Technology Gets Big Boost in Bringing Web3 Privacy Cross-chain,8,14nvjmy,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/14nvjmy/opl_technology_gets_big_boost_in_bringing_web3/,14,"Bringing privacy to web3 dApps has always been a top priority for Oasis Network. Without the tag of being a privacy [alt](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/oasis-network/), Oasis has been rather focused on using privacy-preserving techniques like trusted execution environments or TEEs in their blockchain technology so that Solidity developers can create dApps for web3 users where their data privacy rights are maintained. To that end, Oasis has given the industry its first-ever confidential paratime - Sapphire. But must all dApps be natively created in Oasis? What about the dApps of other EVM chains and how do they get access to privacy solutions? The answer lies in the cross-chain customizable privacy tool - the Oasis Privacy Layer or [OPL](https://oasisprotocol.org/opl).

OPL is a tremendous achievement in interoperability. Powered by Oasis Sapphire, it has two components - the message-passing bridge and the gas relayer. It‚Äôs the best way to leverage cross-chain privacy solutions on any EVM web3 dApp, and there‚Äôs no need for migrating chains or inconveniencing the users in any way. In fact, the message-passing bridge ensures that all data to and fro are encrypted and signed while the gas relayer ensures the users can pay for the extremely low-cost gas fees for the transactions payable in the native chain‚Äôs tokens only.

The Celer Interchain Messaging (IM) messaging framework [integrated](https://oasisprotocol.org/blog/celer-messaging-bridge-integration) with Oasis Sapphire that was announced recently will give a great boost to OPL functionality as it will be the key to connecting the native EVM chain and Sapphire. As a result, Solidity developers will be able to leverage the unique confidentiality features of Oasis that offer customizable confidential state and privacy solutions to the dApps.

On top of this, the engineering updates for May saw Oasis releasing the first version of the [Oasis fork of OpenGSN](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@oasislabs/opengsn-cli) for early adopters.

With these crucial developments now live, OPL [functionality](https://docs.oasis.io/dapp/opl/) to ensure privacy for web3 dApps becomes handy for developers. This is especially great news for those leveraging OPL features for their dApps to be showcased during the upcoming hackathon.

What hackathon? The P4W3 hackathon, of course. Stay tuned for the [Oasis Rendezvous](https://oasisrose.garden/event/oasis-rendezvous-coffee-croissants-and-privacy/) in Paris on July 19 for more details.

Crypto Goes Serverless This Cycle With the Help of a Project from Binance Labs (Marlin),7,14n9ooo,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/14n9ooo/crypto_goes_serverless_this_cycle_with_the_help/,0,"Projects will be looking for ways to become more censorship resistant and one of the easiest changes they can make towards that goal is to end their reliance on centralized cloud services (AWS) by integrating something called ""Oyster"" which enables uncensorable serverless frontend UI for any dAPP as well as serverless Backends. Oyster also has use cases for ZK proofs.

&#x200B;

Marlin, which is a Binance Labs project, has been developing this for the past year and is about to roll it out. They're doing a little conference tour at the moment to round up partners to integrate with. 

&#x200B;

Quick rundown:

\--------------------------

Serverless Frontends and Uncensorable UI

Projects that use centralized frontends pose the risk of a single point of failure. Pretty much the whole thing can be shut down by taking out the servers. With Oyster, DAOs & Web3 projects can deploy frontends on a decentralized validator network running secure enclaves via smart contracts. 

A benefit of this beyond becoming more decentralized is it enables Uncensorable UI. It's pretty obvious DEXs will be targeted in the future and at the moment, they are easy targets. Agencies can just send a threatening letter and if the DEX won't comply all that is needed is a court order to take it down from the server. 

With Oyster, there are no servers to be taken down. If a DEX is sufficiently decentralized there is really nothing that can be done to make people stop trading on them. The frontend trading UI can't be shutdown by Blackrock just because they're mad nobody is using their CEXs. 

\------------------

Serverless Backends and the end of Projects focusing on DevOps

Oyster allows DAOs to focus on their mission rather than DevOps. Nobody has to manage authorization keys. The cost of instances is decreased by dividing them amongst users who are only charged by their personal consumption. Oyster improves security as well by providing a secure execution environment for sensitive workloads via oyster enclaves. 

&#x200B;

ZK Proofs Usecase - Oyster works in tandem with the other tech Marlin has been developing, Marlin's ZK Provers, which aim to increase the speed of ZK proof generation using hardware acceleration. The ZK Provers remove the computational burdan from users and routes it to specialized hardware (there will be a ZK Prover market which will allow people to rent out their hardware for this task). Oyster ensures that no data is leaked during this process.

&#x200B;

The main point of this post is that Marlin will have real usage because many projects will be integrating Oyster. I think it's a solid infrastructure play and it's mid cap project with a lot of room to run.

Bumper finance: the first defi volatility equalizer. Protect your ETH and BTC from price crashes,20,14hv12u,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/14hv12u/bumper_finance_the_first_defi_volatility/,3,"Hey guys,

Thought I'll share this with you.

Bumper is a novel solution to the problem of crypto currency volatility. It basically protects your investment like ETH from negative price movements while you are still exposed to price increases (in contrast to a stop loss). It‚Äôs a crazy complex endeavor, but from what the team dropped in their office hours live stream they cracked the code. Simulations and back testing of the price movements of ETH and BTC in the last 4 years look great (see simulation report at the end of the text). If you want to know how it works, check their lite paper.

They recently started working with digital mob,which certainly belong to the best coders in the space. They worked for Maker Dao, Filecoin and a few other successful projects. Thing is, you can‚Äôt just hire them, they get a lot of requests every day. What they want is a portion of the tokens of what¬† they think is going to be the next big thing. So they are pretty confident this will work out.

There was a presale around 1 year ago, but presalers seems to have capitulated at some point because of slow development. Price is around x5 lower if I am correct. It pumped a bit in the last month, but nothing too crazy. They want to launch in August. Marketing will therefore ramp up in July. I think the narrative of price protection¬† is so simple everyone gets it, so it should be easy to market. 


At the moment, it is really under the radar with 6-7mil MC and hardly anyone is active in their channel.

Some deep-dive extra points why bumper is revolutionary for risk hedging (in crypto and probably at some point for tradfi, there is interest from¬†for an enterprise version) 

Main advantages of bumper compared to traditional risk hedging (written for ETH, same goes for WBTC at launch and more assets in the future):

1. Stop Loss without sacrificing upside potential: By employing Bumper to safeguard ETH holdings, investors benefit from a price protection mechanism that mitigates downside risk without impeding the asset's ability to appreciate in value during upward market movements. In contrast to a normal stop loss, with Bumper you don't get priced out when the market surges back after the price fell below floor level, which happens all too often after a stop loss got triggered. 



2. Maximising risk price efficiency: Bumper introduces a groundbreaking mechanism where premium charges are determined dynamically based on different parameters like the volatility of the asset observed during the locking period, in contrast to upfront premium charges commonly practiced in traditional options. At the core of Bumper‚Äôs design is the idea that all risks, and profits, are shared. This means that protection takers are unconcerned about whether they are paying a fair price, and protection makers do not have to compete with other makers. Bumper measures and dynamically responds to price changes and demand, shares liquidity risk among liquidity providers, and shares the cost of risk among protection buyers. With this approach, Bumper maximizes the efficiency of pricing (valuing) price risk and converting it to a stable yield. This innovation, resulting from 2.5 years of collaborative efforts with esteemed experts and professors, positions Bumper as a cost-effective alternative, typically offering a 10% lower premiums than conventional options.


3.¬† Ease of Use: Bumper offers a user-friendly experience, making it highly accessible and straightforward, even for non-professional traders. With Bumper, implementing risk management strategies and protecting ETH holdings requires just a few clicks, eliminating the complexity and learning curve associated with traditional option desks. This intuitive interface empowers users to secure their assets efficiently and conveniently, without the need for specialized financial expertise or extensive market knowledge.

4. bETH Utility: Bumper enhances user utility by returning bETH, a representation of locked ETH, enabling users to unlock additional value from their locked assets and participate in a broader spectrum of decentralized finance (Defi) opportunities. bETH can be as collateral with the interesting feature of following eth's price but never falling below the chosen price floor, which gives it special properties in terms of how liquidations will work.

5. Efficient hedging: Bumper eliminates the need for additional hedging capital by relying solely on the underlying asset, ETH, thereby removing the requirement to reserve funds for purchasing put options. This distinctive feature ensures that the original ETH holdings are protected, rather than relying on derivative products, fostering a more direct and secure hedging approach.

Unveiling UTK Latest Update: Exploring the Future Path Ahead,23,14fwou3,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/14fwou3/unveiling_utk_latest_update_exploring_the_future/,18," 

For those of you who are following it, I probably don't need to explain much about what UTK is. On the other hand, for those of you who are unfamiliar with it, it's a token from a payment platform called xMoney.

Most recently, they did a rebranding and merged with one more project. Everything is under the MultiversX roof. Now they are providing both crypto and fiat payments.

However, I want to talk about UTK itself. Imho, there is some bullish news that has not been followed by the price yet, but with a spike in BTC, I expect some movement from this alt too.

Max supply is reduced from 1.4 to 1.05b, for 1/4 less than before. A token burn mechanism is also in the pipeline, meaning maximum supply will never become a circulation supply. I think that's very important.

Staking rewards are still ongoing, with around 25% APY, which will be reduced to 10%, so if you hold it, you should stake it and milk all possible passive income.

UTK will also have a key role in the ecosystem, not just for payments but also for passive income for users and merchants. I believe this will be the first project that will actually reward merchants, not like PayPal, which has complete freedom to use merchants' money for their own benefits.

There will be more utilities through the staking for cashback, cards are around the corner too. As I said, there is plenty of good news that will happen this year, and with a kick of bullrun, I expect a spike in UTK.

Bitfinex's delisting of Tokens - Would appreciate some advice,2,14frxgz,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/14frxgz/bitfinexs_delisting_of_tokens_would_appreciate/,0," Hi,

I was holding about 40K PNT at Bitfinex when BFX suspended the coin. I purchased it back in the day at 0.56 and now it is at 0.9 on other exchanges so I am looking to hold it for as long as I need it to be.

I haven't used wallets for years, as I have normally kept all my assets on Bitfinex. I would love some advice on what would be the best for me to withdraw these, i.e. what is the most secure wallet solution out there currently, or any other options I may have.

Even though UtopiaP2P Messenger typically grants access to AI to users from AI-restricted regions, it still offers this feature. In addition to advancing the development of the AI assistant, this accessibility is meant to help people who support innovation, P2E, the lottery, the web, and privacy.

The UtopiaP2P app client offers ChatGPT as a free service every day of the year. They demonstrate their commitment to giving their clients the best user experience and potential by answering user inquiries with amazing speed and accuracy using OpenAI's state-of-the-art language processing technology, which they make available to UtopiaP2P users. In order to enhance app client user experiences, UtopiaP2P has developed a safe and straightforward messaging application. This application combines cutting-edge technology with a user-friendly interface, an accessible ChatGPT assistant, and other features.

UtopiaP2P also has two cryptocurrencies the Crypton Coin (CRP) which is the native and privacy coin of the Utopia P2P ecosystem. It is feasible and incredibly simple to internally mine Crypton Coin. Utopia USD (UUSD) is the first and only anonymous privacy stablecoin with a 1:1 conversion rate to the US dollar. It was created by the UtopiaP2P ecosystem. Both CRP and UUSD are listed on CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap.

The ChatGPT-UtopiaP2P connection generally gives an extra degree of security and privacy to communications, which is difficult to achieve with traditional messaging systems. Channels, group chats, file transfers, quick voice and text messaging, and private conversations are also accessible. Instead of a centralized server relay, peer-to-peer (P2P) and private communications are employed.

2. The decentralized Utopia network offers secure and censorship-resistant messaging and other communication channels, making it difficult for other parties to censor or restrict your messages.

3. To avoid identity theft on the network in Utopia, maintaining your anonymity is essential. People who place a high value on privacy and security should pay particular attention to this.

4. Easy integration: Utopia provides an advanced API that can be used to integrate Chat GPT into the platform, making it easier for developers to utilize the network's power for their projects.

In Utopia, the native cryptocurrency, Crypton, can be used to pay for services within the network, enabling user transactions without the need for traditional financial institutions. Additionally, the UtopiaP2P airdrop offers chances to earn CRP coin every day. The connection between ChatGPT and UtopiaP2P generally adds an extra layer of security and privacy to communications, which is challenging to achieve with traditional messaging systems.

These views do not reflect on an official TradeStrike Team standpoint\*\*

Firstly, before I start here is a link to my \[Previous Ultimate DD\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/13oo3xk/strikex\_dd\_strx\_this\_past\_month/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=ios\_app&utm\_name=ioscss&utm\_content=1&utm\_term=1](https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/13oo3xk/strikex_dd_strx_this_past_month/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1))

\*\*News\*\*¬†

\[CMC Markets who are a FTSE-250 company have acquired a 33% stake in StrikeX Technologies, Cementing a strategic partnership to revolutionise the digital asset industry\]([https://blog.strikex.com/ftse-250-cmc-markets-invests-in-strikex-technologies-cementing-strategic-partnership-8370f21f3df2](https://blog.strikex.com/ftse-250-cmc-markets-invests-in-strikex-technologies-cementing-strategic-partnership-8370f21f3df2))

This announcement came in the AM of the 9th of June 2023 and has gained a lot of traction already.¬†

\*\*What does this mean for StrikeX?\*\*

This is a major step for not only StrikeX but the Web3 industry as a whole, as far as my knowledge goes; there has not been a deal like this before with a Web3 Company.¬†

With a major institutional entity such as \[CMC Markets\]([https://www.cmcmarketsplc.com/](https://www.cmcmarketsplc.com/)) invested in StrikeX gives a lot of comfort to those who have been on the fence for a while. Many of those who are more traditional investors may have more respect and trust for StrikeX now.

‚ÄúOur partnership with CMC Markets will bolster our position as early frontrunners in this dynamic and fast-moving industry, whilst validating our long-term vision and strategy. We strive to pioneer the delivery of traditional financial instruments, such as equities, commodities and bonds to the blockchain, whilst guaranteeing security, compliance, and ease of access via intuitive, secure, and user-friendly products. We are excited by the opportunity this partnership brings and we look forward to sharing more updates as we continue to grow and innovate.‚Äù - Joe Jowett, StrikeX CEO & Co Founder.

\*\*How does this affect the Stock Token Bridge?\*\*

Now this hasn‚Äôt been confirmed however if you read between the lines then you will realise that CMC Markets activates the stock token bridge. They are the vital component to allow the tokenisation of authentic shares.¬†

When a user buys a stock on the Tradestrike exchange then this is sent to the broker and the broker buys on the Stock Exchange. From there the broker will then send the share to be minted and sent back to the user.¬†

The broker in this case is CMC Markets.¬†

‚Äî‚Äî \*\*This next section is the FAQ‚Äôs from StrikeX.com\*\* ‚Äî‚Äî

**\*\*Q1: Why is this investment and partnership important?\*\***

There is little doubt that blockchain technology such as the tokenisation and self-custody of real-world assets can revolutionise the financial industry, what is evidently clear, now more than ever, is that much more must be done by blockchain firms to ensure their growth and innovation is not derailed by inexperience and ignorance of regulatory frameworks.

The investment and partnership of CMC Markets into StrikeX technologies represents a great leap forward for Web3, the benefits of traditional regulated trading firms stepping in to the blockchain space are multi-faceted. Bringing with them expertise in regulatory compliance, credibility and trust, valuable knowledge, and experience. This partnership

serves as a promising pathway for healthy growth and innovation not only for StrikeX

Technologies but for the wider industry.

**\*\*Q2. Why CMC Markets?\*\***

CMC Markets Plc, whose shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange under the ticker

CMCX , was established in 1989 and is now one of the world‚Äôs leading online financial trading businesses. The Group serves retail and institutional clients through regulated offices and branches in 12 countries, with a significant presence in the UK, Australia, Germany, and Singapore. CMC offers an award-winning, online, and mobile trading platform, enabling clients to trade up to 10,000 financial instruments across shares, indices, foreign currencies, commodities, and treasuries through contracts for difference (‚ÄúCFDs‚Äù), financial spread bets (in the UK and Ireland only) and, in Australia, access stockbroking services.

Given the rapid pace of change and increasing adoption of blockchain technologies in the financial services sector, our partnership and investment from CMC Markets provide us with access to highly coveted expertise and market experience. This collaboration not only validates our long-term strategy but also accelerates our development roadmap, opening up possibilities for new innovative technologies and services.

This milestone is significant for both companies and the digital asset industry as a whole. By combining StrikeX‚Äôs expertise in tokenisation and self-custody technologies with CMC Markets‚Äô extensive financial services experience, we are now in a strong position to revolutionise the way individuals and businesses invest in digital assets.

**\*\*Q3. What is the nature of the investment?\*\***

CMC Markets has acquired a 33% stake in StrikeX Technologies, with two CMC members being welcomed onto the StrikeX Technologies board, bringing with them their wealth of expertise and experience to contribute to the growth and ongoing success of the StrikeX business.

**\*\*Q4. Are there plans to merge StrikeX with CMC?\*\***

No, this is not a merger deal. StrikeX Technologies will remain an independent company, with CMC owning a 33% equity stake.

**\*\*Q5. How are CMC Markets‚Äô products complimentary to StrikeX Technologies (what are the future plans)?\*\***

By combining StrikeX‚Äôs expertise in tokenisation and self-custody technologies with CMC

Markets‚Äô extensive experience in financial services, both companies are now well-positioned

to transform the way people and businesses invest in digital assets.

‚Äî‚Äî \*\*End of FAQ‚Äôs\*\*‚Äî‚Äî

\*\*My Conclusion\*\*

A partnership with CMC Markets was definitely something that people needed to see, those who were on the fence and those who are already invested. This brings so much more solidarity to TradeStrike and also proves the potential.¬†

An entity like CMC Markets does not just do deals like this without some proper due diligence (hopefully you guys read some of my posts lol).¬†

The community is fired up like it used to be and the price is making everyone happy. Those who know the price doesn‚Äôt matter at this stage are still equally as happy as those who care all about the price.¬†

It‚Äôs a great day to be a part of something special.¬†

Here‚Äôs to health, wealth and prosperity¬†üì∑üì∑

"Confirmed reversal indicator on the Daily Chart of TLOS ""Bag Some"" has Appeared after the Collaboration Announcement with GameStop!",22,13zp0jd,altcoin,https://i.redd.it/6x4xeest7v3b1.jpg,10,"2 days ago, GameStop made an exciting announcement that sent shockwaves through the crypto and gaming communities. The renowned retailer revealed its partnership with Telos Network, a prominent Layer-1 blockchain protocol that has now rebranded itself as ""Layer Zero"", (meaning on google: https://www.google.com/search?q=what+is+layer-zero+blockchain&oq=what+is+layer-zero+blockchain&aqs=chrome..69i57j0i22i30l3j0i390i650l3.9178j0j4&client=ms-android-xiaomi-rvo3&sourceid=chrome-mobile&ie=UTF-8). This strategic collaboration marked an important milestone in GameStop's Web3 expansion strategy, generating significant interest and speculation among investors and enthusiasts alike.

Following the announcement ( https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/gamestop-teams-up-with-the-telos-foundation-to-grow-web3-gaming-strategy/ar-AA1bZRTG ), it became evident that this partnership had a direct impact on the price of the TLOS token, the native token of Telos Network. The chart displayed above clearly depicts a substantial price pump for the TLOS token, the market's enthusiastic response to the news. This surge in value demonstrated the market's anticipation and optimism surrounding the potential synergies between GameStop and Telos. Chart here: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/telos/

Given the notable price movement and the growing buzz surrounding this collaboration, many individuals have aped into this market. The term ""ape"" in this context refers to entering a market with significant enthusiasm and investment, often driven by FOMO (fear of missing out) and high-profit expectations.

Before deciding to explore this network and potentially invest in the TLOS token, it is crucial to assess the fundamental aspects of Telos. One of the key features highlighted by the network is its promising no-downtime characteristic. This means that the Telos blockchain aims to provide a highly reliable infrastructure, ensuring uninterrupted availability and functionality. Such a feature can be particularly appealing to users who value stability and reliability in a blockchain network.

Additionally, Telos claims to offer the almost-zero  transaction fees compared to other blockchain networks. Lower fees can be a significant advantage, as it enables users to conduct transactions more cost-effectively and facilitates broader adoption of the network. However, you still need to conduct thorough research and evaluate the network's fee structure in relation to its scalability, security, and overall performance to gain a comprehensive understanding of its competitiveness.

DYOR: A lot of hype has obviously been out by the latest deal between GameStop and Telos, but investors should proceed with caution and complete thorough due diligence before making any choices. Happy Trading üìà üôÇ",2023-06-03 15:46:33,1685825193.0
Technical analysis of a low cap altcoin that has potential,4,13tdi3v,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/13tdi3v/technical_analysis_of_a_low_cap_altcoin_that_has/,13,"Unfortunately due to my low karma, I couldn't post anywhere else about this thing and most of the major cryptocurrency subreddits just outright removed the post. Even a smaller crypto currency subreddit shadow banned it for some reason despite the legitimate TA I'm putting out. People make fun of my posts too which is disheartening to say the least.

The chart shows that there's significant consolidation that has been on going for about 3 or so weeks, and the symmetrical triangle that formed is pretty much on the cusp of breaking out to the upside. Not to mention the price action is above my preferred moving avgs which further reinforces price action. Low volume presents an interesting scenario where there could be hidden accumulation here, while price is steadily moving up. Compared to the volume of the first week of this coin, the volume levels now are abysmal, but price is steadily and surely moving up. According to cmc the low was 8 days ago, and there's a chance this could run up if there's enough momentum to break out of this low volume lull. All in all from a technical analysis perspective it has potential, but the low volume can drastically affect the movement of the coin as lots of 1-3k buys and sells really moves the price around. Still it seems like there's been more accumulation over these last few week especially with the bounce off the fib retracement lines and subsequent higher low.

EDIT: Updating my analysis on the main post. On the daily it seems like it's producing an advance block which means it could drop around 20% back down to the bottom of the symmetrical triangle or even further to the Fibonacci retracement line if it's really weak. Buying now could be unwise as there might be some sellers coming in despite the lack of heavy volume. Just keep an eye out!

Update upon update: The advance block looks like it fizzled out due to price action bouncing off moving avgs. it also seems somewhat solidly above the upper resistance and may continue!

Update update update: It seems like the advance block has continued. Woke up in the middle of the night as saw that it has retraced a bit (around 8%) so I reduced my position in the expectation of a retrace. This weakness also showed as a double top on the 4h. (It's always good to confirm moves on multiple timeframes). Depending on how strong the downward trend is, it could bounce off the light green line it broke out of, the previous upward trend orange line, or the last fib retracement levels. Ideally I would prefer it to make a higher low to continue the upward trend and it seem most likely that's what's gonna happen.  


Last update: Seems like it did pump, good fortune for anybody who got in while I was rambling. it seems to be goin.  
Just my opinion and this isn't financial advice.

Palmswap: A Non-Custodial Perpetual DEX on BNB with up to 50x Leverage,11,13qi0je,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/13qi0je/palmswap_a_noncustodial_perpetual_dex_on_bnb_with/,13,"The total volume of spot trading on all cryptocurrency exchanges worldwide exceeds $50 billion per day. While this is a large value, it pales in comparison to **the trading volume of crypto derivatives, which is $150 billion daily**. Derivatives are responsible for the majority of trading volumes in the crypto market, and a significant portion of stablecoin supply is also used in derivative trading. In other words, **derivatives are the backbone of the crypto market**.

Most of the trading in crypto derivatives is currently concentrated on centralized exchanges, with DEXs accounting for only a few percentage points. However, decentralized exchanges are growing much faster. In the foreseeable future, **trading volumes for derivatives on DEXs will increase to hundreds of billions and, eventually‚Äîtrillions of dollars**.

Among the decentralized exchanges for perpetual contracts, notable projects include dYdX, Perpetual Protocol, GMX, Vela Exchange, Metavault Trade, MCDEX, TakePile, Palmswap, and several others. dYdX and Perpetual Protocol are well-known and covered by many analysts. I want to cover their lesser-known counterparts, which are riskier for trading and investing, but could potentially offer a higher upside. This article will examine [Palmswap](https://palmswap.org/).

# Palmswap v1

Palmswap is a decentralized exchange for trading perpetual contracts with leverage on the BNB Chain.

The exchange was launched in 2022, and in October of last year, the team **raised over $4 million** in investments. Additionally, several million dollars were also raised in March of 2023.

In February, the Palmswap team launched Alpha Mainnet. Palmswap V1 is built on an AMM algorithm and allows trading of perpetual contracts with leverage of up to 10x. The exchange offers limit orders, market orders, stop-loss orders, and take-profit orders.

# Palmswap v2

This summer, v1 will cease operation and be replaced by Palmswap v2. The main difference between v1 and **v2 is the on-chain trading engine**. While v1 is based on AMM, v2 is built on a synthetic architecture that is more scalable and sustainable.

https://preview.redd.it/7et7fe5xdr1b1.png?width=2133&format=png&auto=webp&s=9dbefb8909dac5abd310877ae4e026b6f691a080

The full list of v2 features includes:

* Perpetual trading (long and short);
* Up to 50x leverage;
* No registration or deposit required (non-custodial);
* All trades are on-chain;
* 0% price impact;
* Median spot prices. No scam-wicks;
* No order books or liquidity for each pair. Single PLP vault for all trading pairs listed for higher capital efficiency;
* Synthetic leverage. Up to 50%+ more capital efficient;
* Real-time spot prices on-demand and on-chain via Chainlink;
* 1-click trading;
* No front-running;
* Liquidity providers (USDT) will be receiving up to 60% of trading fees;
* PALM token stakers will be receiving up to 30% of trading fees;
* New UI/UX.

# PLP Event

Liquidity providers are critical for the success of Palmswap v2. To attract them, Palmswap plans to hold a [PLP Event](https://palmswaporg.gitbook.io/copy-of-palmswap-v2/ecosystem/lp-event) in the coming months.

In exchange for providing their capital in the form of USDT, liquidity providers will receive a share of the trading fees, as well as PALM tokens. **A total of $500,000 worth of PALM tokens will be distributed among liquidity providers.**

https://preview.redd.it/cr1x1ip0er1b1.png?width=1230&format=png&auto=webp&s=729b78c853b51313c9ee5ea009d8f4bf5a5e636d

Liquidity providers will receive 1 PLP (PALM Liquidity Provider) token for every 1 USDT they contribute. The full list of rewards for PLP token holders includes:

* 60% trading fees paid in USDT;
* Losses credit to vault, PLP benefits;
* Borrow Fee;
* Liquidation Fees;
* Mint / Burn fees.

The PLP vault acts as a counterparty for all trades made on the platform:

* When traders win (positive PnL), their profits are paid from the vault.
* When traders lose (negative PnL), their losses are sent to the vault.

The vault not only incurs losses from traders, but also receives a significant **60% portion of leverage trading fees**, as well as 100% of the mint/burn and borrow fees paid hourly, which are proportionally divided among PLP holders to incentivize them to remain in the vault.

The synthetic nature of the Palmswap protocol v2 eliminates the possibility of impermanent loss, because liquidity is provided solely through USDT.

Palmswap‚Äôs Roadmap

* May 15, 2023: Applications for participation in the PLP event started.
* June 1, 2023: Launch of the [referral program](https://docs.palmswap.org/protocol/referral-program). Referrers receive a share of trading fees for inviting new users.
* June 20, 2023: Deadline for applications for the PLP event.
* June 27, 2023: Early PLP event access.
* June 27, 2023: Global Event starts.
* July 5, 2023: Launch of Palmswap v2.
* July 26, 2023: Start of [Trade 2 Earn](https://docs.palmswap.org/ecosystem/trade-2-earn) competition, which will run in two stages in July ‚Äî August of 2023, and in August 2023 ‚Äî July 2024.

PLP minting will begin on June 27. PLP can be exchanged for USDT eight days after the launch of Palmswap v2.

Conclusion

Palmswap is a DEX for leveraged trading on the BNB Chain. The second version of the protocol, which is launching this summer, looks promising, and the team seems to have enough capital to see their vision through and weather out the crypto winter.

Before I start, please take some time and read my other \[DD‚Äôs\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/TradeStrike/comments/12n4zeg/strikex\_dd\_strx\_the\_king\_of\_rwa/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=ios\_app&utm\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/r/TradeStrike/comments/12n4zeg/strikex_dd_strx_the_king_of_rwa/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf))

* Verification on Twitter¬†

\*\*StrikeX secures large institutional client\*\*

This is a big one to start off with, on the 8th May we got the announcement that StrikeX has secured an institutional client for their new Web3 Consultancy Service.

\*\*What is a Web 3 Consultancy Service?\*\*

StrikeX will provide education and advise corporations on the full potential of Web3 and it‚Äôs ever changing digital landscape. StrikeX will be the market leading advisor for this industry.¬†

\*\*What does this mean for StrikeX and it‚Äôs followers?\*\*

StrikeX is evolving and extending their reach in this industry. This means that the organisation is becoming more than a project that can deliver innovative products and bridge the gap between traditional finance and web3.¬†

‚ÄúFurthermore, we are thrilled to have already signed our first client, a prominent UK-based financial institution with global operations.‚Äù \[Medium\]([https://blog.strikex.com/strikex-secures-large-institutional-client-e0d819de0266](https://blog.strikex.com/strikex-secures-large-institutional-client-e0d819de0266))

The above statement from StrikeX adds some proof that this amazing concept can and is working.

‚ÄúWe aim to empower institutions, including financial organisations, corporations, government entities, and nonprofits, by equipping them with the knowledge and tools needed to navigate the realm of the blockchain.‚Äù \[Medium\]([https://blog.strikex.com/strikex-secures-large-institutional-client-e0d819de0266](https://blog.strikex.com/strikex-secures-large-institutional-client-e0d819de0266))¬† This shows that StrikeX is here for the long term, from being For The People and providing retail investors the best trading platform to being the go to for institutions to learn about the blockchain.¬†

What this means for the StrikeX holders is that we are buying into more than just a 24/7 Tokenised Marketplace. We are buying into a massive organisation that will specialise in so much more than originally thought. Thus creating more demand to be a holder of this coin.¬†

\*\*StrikeX Wallet Roadmap\*\*

There are 13 steps to this new roadmap and I will try and give as much detail as possible.

* P/L algorithm replacement
* This has been long requested by the community and the Team are showing that they are listening.
* Ledger integration
* Ledgers are one of the most important devices in the crypto world as they keep your tokens the safe they can be since it is a physical cold wallet storing device. Having Ledger integration in the StrikeX Wallet allows users from all over to use the wallet to link with their device. This will attract more serious users.
* Buy/Sell checkout workflow V2
* This is quite self explanatory, it‚Äôs an update on the checkout when you buy or sell.¬†
* Biometrics on/off button¬†
* There will be an option for you to toggle the biometric login.
* Arbitrum & MATIC integration
* Integrating Arbitrum & MATIC will cause a spike in downloads as both communities love it when a wallet supports their network.
* V2 in-app browser / Marketplace¬†
* This feature will cause a lot of people to come to StrikeX Wallet as it is one feature I personally use a lot on other wallets. If this is done correct and seamless to use then I believe this could be the factor that causes StrikeX Wallet to really take off.¬†
* In-App Notifications¬†
* There will be updates and you will be notified within the app itself.
* Additional on/off ramp service (BANXA)
* BANXA is a trusted company that allow on and off ramping fiat. Having them will enable StrikeX Wallet users to have the option between Transak and BANXA to on and off ramp.¬†
* NFT Integration
* The NFT marketplace has over 250,000 users per month who are actively trading on OpenSea alone. This marketplace is ever growing and this means that StrikeX opens that door for scaling with them.¬†
* Service Availability / Support page
* There will be an area where users can view & request support for any problems they may come across during their time on the wallet.¬†
* Full V2 Interface UI Update¬†
* The best looking wallet out there is about to look even better.¬†

\*\*Wallet Download Milestones\*\*

Recently on the 4th of May the StrikeX Wallet surpassed 12,000 users in total with 5,000 on Android. Since the launch at the end of September 2022 the wallet has scaled beautifully in downloads. Smashing through the projections and has been very impressive.

\*\*Verification on Twitter\*\*

\[TradeStrikeBVI was verified as an official organisation on Twitter\]([https://twitter.com/tradestrikebvi/status/1648983287237337090?s=46&t=qgFIuoGqkM\_ep9eF5UBTEg¬†](https://twitter.com/tradestrikebvi/status/1648983287237337090?s=46&t=qgFIuoGqkM_ep9eF5UBTEg)) in April, this is a great step to mitigating the fake accounts that try to scam holders & followers.¬†

\*\*Conclusion\*\*¬†

StrikeX is moving in the best direction, with outstanding news like securing an institutional client for their Web3 Consulting it shows that they have the trust of major entities.¬†

A few people are scared because the price is very low and they aren‚Äôt seeing their holdings grow in value as much as the bull market in 2021. However, there is a massive group who know what they hold and why they are holding, they have been surprised with the extra catalysts like TradeX, StrikeX Wallet and now the Web 3 consulting. Personally, I bought because of TradeStrike: The 24/7 tokenised marketplace for the retail user. And that hasn‚Äôt even came out yet! All these extra products are amazing to hear for me, a long term holder.¬†

The paper hands will forever regret selling in 2023 when StrikeX is the market leader battling with the likes of Binance.

There are regular competitions that users can win token and real world unique experiences. It looks like users have won experiences with Mariah Carey, Machine Gun Kelly, and some other big creators out there.

They also had a launch party during Coachella weekend one that looked pretty epic. Nyjah Huston and LA Weekly co-hosted the event. Seems like one of the only projects that actually has utility and a working app. I got the app and I'm messing around on it. There are daily streaks for user responses and a leaderboard to see where people stand. It looks like JAM Token Pool rewards go along with the different competition prizes.

Cold wallet data shows that buyers on coinbase are accumulating hundreds of thousands/millions of BCH with no outflow. Are these small retail investors who did their crypto due diligence and realized that big blocks make sense & can scale for crypto usage worldwide?,2,133vq66,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/133vq66/cold_wallet_data_shows_that_buyers_on_coinbase/,0,"[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin-cash/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin-cash/)

&#x200B;

Cold wallet data shows that buyers on coinbase are accumulating hundreds of thousands/millions of BCH with no outflow.

&#x200B;

Sure the price is $100 for now, but how many coins can be sold at this price? It is estimated there are only around \~10 million BCH that have moved since the 2017 BCH fork.

&#x200B;

With 15% of the total BCH in circulation since 2017, unmoved for years in coinbase cold storage, how long until it continues to increase, to 20% - 25% - 30% - 50%?

&#x200B;

It will happen simply over time if this pattern of accumulation at cheap prices continues.

&#x200B;

Just relax and watch these market forces collide as they have these past few years. It seems the might of US investors has been quietly absorbing BCH selloffs and liquidations, and although the price is still low, it would seem unlikely to stay this way once sellers run out of assets to sell off. BCH is scarce but sellers seem to think there is an unlimited supply and have panic dumped for quite some time.

Transaction Fees: BTSG is used to pay transaction fees on the BitSong blockchain. Every time a user sends or receives a transaction, a small fee is paid in BTSG, which is then used to incentivize the network's node operators to validate the transaction 

Governance: BTSG token holders have the power to vote on proposals related to the future development of the BitSong platform. This gives token holders a voice in the decision-making process and ensures that the platform evolves in a way that aligns with the community's values

Don't also forget that the Bitsong ecosystem utilizes a layer 1 Sovereign method, Designed to allow artists to directly monetized their content and helps fans support their favorite artists through fan tokens

What are your thoughts on airdrops?,29,12yfr9x,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/12yfr9x/what_are_your_thoughts_on_airdrops/,56,"  

Personally, I thought Airdrops was a myth because I couldn't earn anything from them for a long time. 

Before we go any further, what are airdrops and why are they distributed? 

An airdrop is a marketing approach in which coins or tokens are sent to wallet addresses. Small amounts of the new virtual currency are transferred to the wallets of active blockchain community members for free or in exchange for a minor service, such as retweeting a message issued by the company creating the currency. A crypto airdrop's ultimate purpose is to raise awareness and circulation of a new token or coin.

Now that we know what airdrops are, I'm sure some people have been lucky enough to earn from them in the past, such as with ARB, which is still the most recent one that has changed my mind about airdrops. 

I got up to $5000 in ARB from the airdrop, which I quickly sold. Since then, I've been looking for airdrops to see if I can get a decent one like ARB. 

I've been following up on this CHUNKS Airdrop for about 2 weeks now; it's new, but I believe it might have the ability to offer even more than ARB because it wants to airdrop 5% of its overall supply, which is massive. The tasks to participate in aren't too difficult, and I've already begun them, so I thought I'd share.

Archangel token has been rising in the last month or so. What‚Äôs causing the huge spike? Information shared by the dev team says that they have been working hard behind the scenes, adding more utilities, marketing and talking to other projects. Also, investors are already researching for the right projects to invest before the Bull Run starts.

Archangel token is about 1.5 years old and is a community-owned project. 

Info. from the website ‚ÄúIn 2021, a community of passionate digital asset enthusiasts created & launched the ArchAngel Token and project. Under this banner, we resolved to create a project that focuses on four core areas: Industry & Technology, Projects & Ecosystems, People & Communities, and using these three combined we will achieve Financial Freedom. 
If you share these goals then you have found the right project.

Our primary use case is to build an ecosystem and dynamic user environment that actively pursues objectives and goals within our four cornerstone focus areas.
Please take a few moments to read the project documents that are posted on this site:  Whitepaper, Technical Roadmap, Ecosystem Roadmap, and our NFT Collection Guide.
Archa Staking Pool:  Archa‚Äôs ERC20 token (ARCHA)  is the base token within the ecosystem and offers investors with the opportunity to stake their Archa tokens. 

Staked tokens earn holders passive rewards with additional Archa tokens, but more importantly they earn native tokens from every project within the Ecosystem within Archa‚Äôs Distribution of Value (DoV) model. Each token within the ArchAngel ecosystem provides a portion of their transactional taxes back to the Archangel staking pools where they are distributed to stakers. Earn tokens from each and every project in the Ecosystem (including Archa) by simply staking your Archa. 

Archa on Guardian Platform
This is how ecosystems are supposed to work!
Check out ArchAngel‚Äôs Project Dashboard on the Guardian Platform.  Guardian Token, an ArchAngel Ecosystem partner, is developing the Guardian Platform to become the most comprehensive user-focused data platform within the industry.

StrikeX DD - $STRX - (The King of #RWA),10,12n51ex,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/12n51ex/strikex_dd_strx_the_king_of_rwa/,11,"**These are my views and my opinion on StrikeX Technologies Ltd. & TradeStrike BVI. These views do not reflect on an official TradeStrike Team standpoint**

Before I start, please take some time and read my other [DD‚Äôs](https://www.reddit.com/r/TradeStrike/comments/zj0umf/strikex_dd_strx_2022_with_strikex/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)


**What is RWA?**

Real World Assets. 

This acronym is taking over crypto Twitter recently and will continue to gain traction. So what exactly is it? 

RWA stands for Real World Assets. This includes, but is not limited to, Tokenisation of Real World Assets. These are assets outside of the blockchain that get tokenised to allow them to be integrated into the decentralised finance (DeFi) ecosystem. 

For a far more in depth [explanation of RWA‚Äôs read this article by StrikeX.](https://blog.strikex.com/understanding-the-tokenisation-of-rwas-6f82cdc1b28d) 

**Whats the difference between Synthetic RWA and Tokenised RWA?**

Synthetic:
‚ÄúA Synthetic RWA token is an on-chain token that gives the holder exposure to the price of a real-world asset. Holding a synthetic asset token does not afford ownership rights to the underlying asset. Simply put, you do not own the real thing.‚Äù - [StrikeX Medium](https://blog.strikex.com/rwas-you-need-to-know-this-not-all-tokens-are-created-equal-3cf4f54e8847) 

Tokenised:
‚ÄúIn contrast, Tokenised RWA tokens offer a digitised replica of the real-world asset, which can provide token holders with ownership rights, such as voting and dividend payments. In short, you own the token; you own the real thing.‚Äù - [StrikeX Medium](https://blog.strikex.com/rwas-you-need-to-know-this-not-all-tokens-are-created-equal-3cf4f54e8847)

So essentially, Synthetic is a copy and Tokenised is the real thing. 

**How is StrikeX the king of RWA?**

StrikeX has been building their flagship product TradeStrike over the last 2 years focusing deeply on a 24/7 Marketplace for Tokenised Assets tailored to the retail investor. 

They will utilise their token $STRX to carry out all transactions on the [Stock Token Bridge](https://twitter.com/tradestrikebvi/status/1646197066878664722?s=46&t=0N8lW-ec-ykgUx9-y7bNhg) thus bringing the stock market volume to the StrikeX token.

‚ÄúAt StrikeX, we have long recognised the inevitable shift towards a tokenised economy and have spent the last two years laying the foundations of an ecosystem that can harness its truly breathtaking potential.‚Äù - [StrikeX Medium](https://blog.strikex.com/understanding-the-tokenisation-of-rwas-6f82cdc1b28d)

You can read more on this [in their recent Newsletter](https://twitter.com/tradestrikebvi/status/1643683262223589381?s=46&t=0N8lW-ec-ykgUx9-y7bNhg) 

**How is Tokenisation the future**

With major institutions like BlackRock and Citi Bank on board you can never really go wrong.

‚ÄúInstitutional giants such as Citi Bank and BlackRock are now touting the tokenisation of RWAs as the single biggest use case for the mass adoption of blockchain technology. With a potential market size in the tens of trillions of dollars, and the World Economic Forum suggesting that 10% of Global GDP will be tokenised by 2030, the excitement around this emerging market is palpable.‚Äù [StrikeX Medium](https://blog.strikex.com/understanding-the-tokenisation-of-rwas-6f82cdc1b28d)


**Conclusion**

StrikeX is ahead of the curve with tokenisation of Real World Assets and is one of the few projects that are actually leading the tokenised RWA wave. I have seen many projects claiming to be all about tokenised RWA however they are Synthetic. 

I genuinely believe that StrikeX is the king of RWA and is in a prime position to absolutely explode. Especially with the way things are going.

Ethereum‚Äôs Shanghai Upgrade Unlocks Staking Rewards: A Bullish Sign for Markets?,5,12koaph,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/12koaph/ethereums_shanghai_upgrade_unlocks_staking/,3," 

# [Ethereum](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum)

Ethereum, the world‚Äôs second-largest cryptocurrency, has recently undergone a [major upgrade called Shanghai](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/04/12/ethereums-shanghai-upgrade-activates-starting-new-era-of-staking-withdrawals/). This upgrade has unlocked staking rewards, which many people believe is a bullish sign for the markets, despite what some may think.

At first glance, one might assume that unlocking staking rewards would cause people to withdraw their coins immediately, leading to a bearish market. However, this assumption overlooks the fact that many people who stake their coins do not plan on immediately unlocking them. Instead, they use staking providers like Lido and Rocket Pool to gain liquidity even before their coins are unlocked on the main chain.

The Shanghai upgrade has been a success, and it could lead to an increase in the total number of staking coins. People who previously hesitated to stake their coins due to the fear of not being able to unlock them may now feel more confident in doing so. This increased staking activity could be a positive sign for the markets, as it demonstrates a greater commitment to the Ethereum ecosystem.

Furthermore, the Shanghai upgrade has introduced several other improvements to the Ethereum network, such as reducing the gas fees required for transactions. This reduction in fees is another positive sign for the Ethereum market, as it makes the network more accessible to a wider range of users.

In conclusion, the Shanghai upgrade is an exciting development for the Ethereum community. The unlocking of staking rewards may seem like a bearish signal at first, but it actually represents a greater level of confidence in the Ethereum ecosystem. The success of this upgrade could lead to increased staking activity and a more accessible network, which could ultimately lead to a more bullish market.

It‚Äôs worth noting that Ethereum made a significant change back in September 2022 when it switched from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS). This change means that Ethereum is now a stake coin, which has several advantages over PoW coins. For example, PoS is more energy-efficient and can handle a greater number of transactions. Additionally, with PoS, stakers have a greater say in the governance of the network.

Most popular ETHASH Asic miners :

* [**Antminer E9 pro**](https://mineshop.eu/antminer-e9-ethash/)
* [**IPOLLO V1 MINI 300 mhs**](https://mineshop.eu/ipollo-v1-mini-280-mhs-for-ethash/)
* [**JASMINER X4-Q 1040MH 370w**](https://mineshop.eu/jasminer-x4-q-1040mh-370w/)

As a result of this change, some popular ETHASH ASICs are no longer able to mine Ethereum, but they can still mine other coins like ETC and ETHW. This change has led to some shifts in the mining landscape, but overall, it has been a positive move for Ethereum. The shift to PoS has been in the works for several years, and it represents a significant step forward for the network.",2023-04-13 07:57:56,1681390676.0

Cryptocurrency mining has been gaining significant attention in recent years, and the Kaspa network is the latest addition to this trend. With its unique blockchain protocol, Kaspa has created a buzz in the crypto world, and its rising prices since October 2022 have led to increased profitability in GPU mining. In this blog post, we will explore Kaspa mining, the best GPUs to use, and how to check mining results accurately.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6m7agsz7k8sa1.jpg?width=2000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=add77c031e84a9e269a0afb915d71f7c317a453d

What is Kaspa Mining?

Kaspa is a decentralized, open-source blockchain platform that aims to provide a faster and more efficient way of processing transactions. Unlike Bitcoin, which has a block size limit of 1MB, Kaspa‚Äôs block size limit is dynamic, meaning it can adjust according to the network‚Äôs needs. This dynamic block size limit ensures faster transaction processing, making Kaspa a promising alternative to Bitcoin.

Kaspa uses a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus algorithm, which means that miners have to solve complex mathematical problems to validate transactions and earn rewards. The mining process involves using computer hardware, specifically GPUs, to perform these calculations.

Best GPUs for Kaspa Mining

The profitability of Kaspa mining depends on several factors, such as the current market price of Kaspa, the mining difficulty, and the cost of electricity. However, using the right GPU can significantly improve your mining efficiency and profitability.

The RTX 4000 series GPUs are the best currently at the time of this post for Kaspa mining, with the most efficient being the [RTX 4070Ti](https://mineshop.eu/gigabyte-4070ti-gvn407tgaming-oc-12gd/) and RTX 4090. The RTX 4070Ti can achieve a hashrate of 1100mhs at 100w, while the RTX 4090 can achieve a hashrate of 2200mhs at 240w. These GPUs are more energy-efficient and powerful, making them ideal for Kaspa mining.

Our shop also manufactures plug and play [Kaspa mining rig with NVIDIA GPU](https://mineshop.eu/netpeer-x47o-nvidia-rtx-gpu-mining-rig/).

Profitability of Kaspa Mining

The profitability of Kaspa mining depends on various factors, such as the price of Kaspa, the mining difficulty, and the cost of electricity. One RTX 4090 GPU can currently generate approximately $65 in passive income from mining a month currently, assuming a Kaspa price of $0.03 and an electricity cost of $0.10 per kWh.

However, it‚Äôs essential to note that the profitability of Kaspa mining can fluctuate depending on market conditions.

HBAR Revolution: How Hedera's Unique Tech is Shaping the Crypto World ‚Äì Don't Miss Out!,1,125u1du,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/125u1du/hbar_revolution_how_hederas_unique_tech_is/,1,"The number of HBAR investors increased as HashPack‚Äôs wallet count spiked. MFI and CMF were bullish, but the rest suggested a continued downtrend. Hedera \[HBAR\] will **upgrade the Hedera mainnet to v0.35.2 on 31 March.** 

While Hedera developers worked on the update, it was also interesting that HashPack, a leading HBAR wallet, **hit 250,000 account creations**

As HashPack users account for 90% of the Hedera ecosystem, an increase in their numbers reflects Hedera‚Äôs growth. It was also interesting to note that Hedera recently crossed the milestone of successfully completing 6 billion transactions on its mainnet.¬†

HBAR‚Äôs Money Flow Index (MFI) was entering the oversold zone. This was positive, as it could increase buying pressure. Another bullish indicator was the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF), which registered an uptick lately. Nonetheless, nothing can be said with certainty as the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Ribbons continued to favor the bears.¬†  


**HEDERA remains the most convenient token for active trading, which is due to the Hashgraph technology itself and its bonuses.**

The data of the sites and the analysis of the behavior of the token give enough reason to consider it a promising investment in the near future. Like other tokens, HBAR does not ignore the trends of BTC, which is clearly tired of the bearish trend and intends to turn into a bull. And here there is a double cumulative effect, because the HBAR ecosphere is much wider than the use of tokens on PoW.

We can expect HBAR to grow by 25-50% in the next 2-3 weeks

Spring portfolio hunt for the real bull run,40,11zdraf,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/11zdraf/spring_portfolio_hunt_for_the_real_bull_run/,57,"We all already have plans for what we want to have in our bags for the next bull. Some tokens have already been accumulated‚Ä¶ others will be purchased after a market correction. However, we always leave room for a few gems in our bags (at least I do).

I want to share some projects that I‚Äôm keeping on my watchlist for this case.

**AI:**

This could be the leader in the next bull market and I think projects centered around AI could be a good investment. I already made some decent profits on some of them - OCEAN and GRT are my picks from this area.

**DeFi:**

In this sector, I‚Äôm really bullish on AAVE. I think it will reach a new ATH, and perhaps hit the $1K mark.

**Layer 0:**

ATOM and DOT aren‚Äôt moonshots or anything, but I see them as strong projects that give provide high APYs for staking. It makes it much easier to hold during the whole bear market, so I‚Äôm filling a portion of my bags with these gems.

**Layer 1:**

EGLD. Its ATH is 10x from here - in the previous bull run, this project nearly had nothing developed in its chain. Now it looks more robust, with a lot of development in progress. They built a lot during the bear market and, if they hit again at ATH, I will be more than happy.

I have a bag of QANX too, which is another Layer 1 but in the testnet phase. However, they already have partners that will use their private blockchain. Also, it's followed by some unique features such as coding in any programming language and mining and validation with a phone. Even though it's 15x from its ATH, it's a low cap and could get much higher.

**Last but not least, an NFT marketplace:**

POOP - it's nothing as you would assume from the name. This will be something like an OpeanSea for the Polkadot ecosystem. Although it‚Äôs not that far from the ATH, however, it's a low cap, so it can go much higher.

Are you bullish on one specific crypto area, or do you prefer diversification? Which alts are you keeping an eye on?

What needs to happen for privacy in Web3 to go mainstream?,10,11w7gi4,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/11w7gi4/what_needs_to_happen_for_privacy_in_web3_to_go/,13,"I've been a privacy advocate for a long time but when it comes to privacy in Web3 we've mostly accepted that it isn't possible. Yes, we do have certain silos that allow transactional anonymity with networks like Monero and Zcash, but those are often frowned upon by regulators and don't address privacy on a much larger and broader scale.

In the last few months I've seen and experienced several solutions that address privacy on a small contract level. Popular players in the field include [Oasis](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/oasis-network), [Secret](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/secret) and others like Aztec and Railgun which don't have an associated token so far. One common problem I've noticed is the poor UX. I have to sacrifice convenience and move all my logic over to a siloed network - it's clunky and not scalable at all.

Oasis, which for most part has a siloed [confidential EVM runtime](https://oasisprotocol.org/blog/get-to-know-sapphire-the-industry-first-confidential-evm-paratime), does have a very promising solution to this problem - a [privacy layer for Web3](https://oasisprotocol.org/blog/the-oasis-privacy-layer-powered-by-sapphire). It would be very similar to Railgun but what's exciting is that it hugely improves UX as the end user would be using their existing frontends and wouldn't even know they're protecting their on-chain activity, on any EVM compatible chain, using the Oasis Network.

Privacy unfortunately is only a nice have for most users in Web3. This means that unless we vastly improve the UX pain points we won't see any meaningful interest. You can see a demo of this presented at ETH Denver a couple of weeks ago for a [secret ballot use case](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbl3ViISrm8) on BNB Chain.

Would love to know your thoughts on this :)",2023-03-19 22:40:33,1679283633.0

Why is Reddit-backed $BRICK exploding today while everything else is down?,0,11oc97s,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/11oc97s/why_is_redditbacked_brick_exploding_today_while/,2,"BRICK (marketcap $3,300,000, up 45% today) is backed by Reddit, a company with a valuation of $10 billion.  The ability to trade BRICK on mainnet from testnet was recently enabled, and has already climbed 600% in the last 30 days.  With only a $3,300,000 marketcap, I believe this native Reddit community point token has huge potential.

Reddit has two ‚Äúcommunity point‚Äù tokens, $BRICK and $MOON.  $MOON was developed first, was unlisted on any major exchanges and only 6 months ago had a marketcap of $4,000,000.  Since being listed on a major exchange (Mexc), its marketcap has exploded by 6x to $24,000,000.  Brick, the newer of the two tokens, has **not** yet been listed on any exchanges.

**Deflationary and Capped Supply:** This is not your average shitcoin with infinite supply and zero fundamentals.

There will be a **MAXIMUM** 250 Million Bricks to ever be distributed with a bonding curve similar to bitcoin's mining distribution over time.

Every time a FortniteBR Sub user uses his Bricks to buy a Sub Membership these 500 Bricks get burned so the **deflationary** mechanism is a nice bonus.

Combine the **Capped** **Supply** with people constantly **BURNING** Bricks out of circulation to get the Sub Membership and you get a nice formula for success, not to mention a solid use case. 

This means that over time people will earn less and less **Bricks** per month.

**Ties to Fortnite:** BRICK is backed by Reddit and is the community point system for r/FortniteBR.  Fortnite has maintained a consistent monthly active playerbase of around 80 million, with 2021 being a peak year at 83.3 million MAPs.  Fortnite has more than 390 million registered players to keep the game alive and running. According to the data provided by Active Player, in the last thirty days, the game averaged 252,600,145 peak players in a day.‚Äù - https://fictionhorizon.com/how-many-people-play-fortnite-user-growth-stats/ Around 85% of Fortnite players are aged 18 to 35 - https://explodingtopics.com/blog/fortnite-stats

Fortnite has grown year over year since it began in 2017.  But that‚Äôs besides the point.  It doesn‚Äôt matter what BRICK is attached to, although being attached to fortnite certainly helps as most crypto investors align with the ages that typically play fortnite.  What matters is this coin is safe from rugpulls as it‚Äôs tied to a multi-billion dollar company.  What makes it a good opportunity imo is the fact the marketcap is so low.  Taking everything into account I‚Äôve already mentioned I think it‚Äôs a good buy right now and will only go up.

**Safe:** Reddit, a privately held company, has a valuation of over $10 Billion as of 2021.  (Source: https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/12/22621445/reddit-valuation-revenue-funding-round) Reddit has even proposed that it might be worth as high as $15 Billion in 2023.

A company of this valuation has employed a very large legal department (Google: ‚ÄúReddit legal department‚Äù and scroll through results to get an idea of the size) to handle all major decisions involving risk.  This extends to vetting any cryptocurrency projects it might affiliate itself with.  

Since $BRICK is specifically affiliated with two of Reddit‚Äôs largest subreddits, these have most certainly had countless hours of research and vetting done by numerous legal department staff.  Imagine if Reddit *didn‚Äôt* fully vet $BRICK, and something like a rugpull or exploit happened draining either of all funds.  They‚Äôd be sued on a massive scale, and would likely be found liable for damages.  

Thus, we can deduce that $BRICK has been fully vetted, and is likely one of the safest Memecoins you could invest in today, since it‚Äôs backed by a multi-billion dollar corporation.

**Brick verses Moon** Moon is affiliated only with r/cryptocurrency, whereas Brick is affiliated with r/fortniteBR and Fortnite the game which has hundreds of millions of players.  Also, r/cryptocurrency members are active traders of crypto and selling Moons is somewhat discussed throughout their sub, leading many Moon farmers to sell what they‚Äôve accumulated.

r/fortniteBR members for the most part don‚Äôt actively trade crypto.  Selling community-acquired Brick is prohibited, is against Reddit TOS and can‚Äôt even be discussed on r/fortniteBR (I‚Äôve spoken with the mods, no discussions about buying/selling/trading Brick allowed).

I believe $BRICK is extremely undervalued with a marketcap of just $3,300,000.  This is a drop in the bucket when compared to other memecoins of years past such as Dogecoin, Safemoon and Shiba Inu.  Dogecoin at its peak had a marketcap of $88.8 billion dollars.  Just for comparisons sake, if $BRICK ever gets to this marketcap, you‚Äôd see a return of 3670x your initial investment, meaning $500 invested today would turn into $1,835,000.

**HOW TO BUY:** Step by step instructions on how to buy $BRICK

Step 1. Download the MetaMask Wallet App and follow the in app prompts to set up your initial wallet.

Step 2. Make sure you have Ethereum in your MetaMask wallet.  You can purchase ETH with a debit card by clicking ‚ÄúETH‚Äù under your token list, then clicking ‚ÄúBuy‚Äù

Step 3.  In your MetaMask wallet browser, visit [chainlist.org](https://chainlist.org), scroll down and search networks for ‚ÄúArbitrum Nova‚Äù then select ‚Äúconnect wallet‚Äù.

Step 4. In your MetaMask wallet browser, visit orbiter.finance.  ‚ÄúToken‚Äù at the top should be ‚ÄúETH‚Äù.  ‚ÄúFrom‚Äù should be Ethereum.  ‚ÄúTo‚Äù should be ‚ÄúArbitrum Nova‚Äù.  Input the amount of Ethereum you‚Äôd like to swap and press ‚ÄúSend‚Äù.

Step 5. In your MetaMask browser, visit either [Sushi.com](https://sushi.com) or [RCPswap.com](https://RCPswap.com).  

Sushi Instructions: 
Visit [Sushi.com](https://Sushi.com) and click ‚ÄúEnter App‚Äù in the top right corner.  The top token should be ‚ÄúETH‚Äù and search for BRICK for your bottom token.  Input the amount of ETH you‚Äôd like to swap for BRICK, and press ‚Äúswap‚Äù.

RCPswap Instructions:
The top token should be ‚ÄúETH‚Äù and the bottom token should be ‚ÄúBRICK‚Äù.  Input the amount of ETH you‚Äôd like to swap for BRICK, and press ‚Äúswap‚Äù.

You now own BRICK!  Follow the same steps in reverse whenever you want to sell.

Introducing Onomy Protocol: Merging Forex and DeFi,1,11oafqn,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/11oafqn/introducing_onomy_protocol_merging_forex_and_defi/,2,"Onomy Protocol is a Layer-1 ecosystem that seeks to harmonize the worlds of Forex and decentralized finance. At the core of the ecosystem is the Onomy Network, a proof-of-stake blockchain built using the highly versatile Cosmos SDK framework. The network is maintained by a distributed network of independent validators located around the globe. The Arc Bridge Hub provides interoperability with EVM, non-EVM, and IBC chains.

One of the key features of Onomy Protocol is its Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), which empowers contributors to actively manage and shape the Onomy ecosystem's features, products, marketing initiatives, and more. This is done through Onomy Improvement Proposals (OIPs), which are directly funded from the on-chain treasury managed by all holders of Onomy's native NOM token. The current major OIPs in progress include the Onomy Exchange (a hybrid orderbook+AMM DEX) and the Onomy Reserve (decentralized stablecoin issuance).

The NOM token is the native coin of Onomy Protocol and is used to secure the network through staking, payment for transaction and bridge fees, and for governance in the Onomy DAO. Onomy is governed by the Onomy DAO, providing NOM holders with the opportunity to guide the decision-making process through NOM-weighed votes.

Arc is a hub-and-spoke model bridge that enables users to transfer tokens from an integrated chain to Onomy and back again, or to another integrated chain, by locking up tokens on the integrated chain side of Arc and minting equivalent tokens on the Onomy side of Arc. Arc is completely non-custodial, meaning there is no central intermediary or third-party bridge administrators who could run off with your funds. The security of the Onomy Network, and thus Arc, is through the Onomy Validator Guild (OVG), which is comprised of a decentralized network of globally situated independent validator firms.

To contribute to the merging of the $7T/Day Forex Market with DeFi, join Onomy's thriving community social channels, where you can connect with fellow NOMads and receive guidance on how to get started.

Overall, Onomy Protocol presents a unique opportunity to merge the traditional finance industry with the world of decentralized finance, and its innovative features make it an exciting ecosystem to be a part of.

It's worth noting that Onomy's native token, $NOM, has recently been listed on two major centralized exchanges, Kucoin and Bitfinex. This is a significant milestone for the Onomy network, as it provides increased liquidity and accessibility for traders and investors looking to buy and sell $NOM. Kucoin and Bitfinex are well-established exchanges in the cryptocurrency space, and their decision to list $NOM speaks to the potential that the Onomy platform has to disrupt the traditional financial industry. As more investors become aware of the benefits that the Onomy network offers, it's likely that we'll see increased adoption of $NOM, which could drive up its value in the long run.

If you are a recent participant in the crypto market, specifically in early 2022, you may know about Layer1 projects, Defi projects, and recent trends, then you may know about Aptos - a Layer1 blockchain project that operates using the Move language, with the goal of being a Solana Killer & ETH Killer(Here's the project if you don't know [APTOS](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/aptos/))

On October 19, 2022, Aptos mainnet launched and caused a huge buzz on social media at that time due to the backing of the Diem team and a massive airdrop for users. Like previous testers, I also received this gift and decided to invest it in a native dapp managed and launched by the Aptos development team called the Aptos Name Service. At that time, to mint a 3-character domain of ANS, you needed 80 APT, 4 characters required 40 APT, and 5 characters required 20 APT. At that time, I wondered why the ecosystem's domain was so expensive, but then I trusted the project and bought one domain. Everything would be completely normal like other domain projects until early 2023, when I wanted to renew my domain. After a search, I found that my domain could not be renewed. I went to Discord, asked, and received an answer from the project that there was currently no renewal function and would be added in the future:)). At this point, I had doubts about the project but still ignored them and continued to use it. But it seems that all my guesses and doubts are gradually becoming true.

&#x200B;

On March 8, 2023, which was yesterday, ANS announced on its Twitter that they want to increase the number of users, so they will reduce the fee for minting ANS domain names, with 3 characters being 20 APT, 4 characters being 10 APT, and 5 characters being 5 APT, which is divided by 4. This is also within my speculation because a domain that costs up to 80 APT is quite expensive and needs to be reduced. But what made me extremely disappointed is the second announcement of the project, that the domains created or purchased on the secondary market since January 1, 2023, will be compensated for one year:)). By this point, you probably understand my point somewhat, since January 1, 2023, so what about those who created in October, November, December?

&#x200B;

I and many early users, who created domains before 2023, asked in Discord, and the project team said that compensation would not be given to those who created domains before that. Later, they sent me a bunch of documents about the TERMS OF USE that they had prepared from February 2023 (i.e., 5 months after early users created domain names). Yes, a VALID set of documents was released after we, the early users who created domains 5 months ago, were required to comply with it (I can confirm to you that I and other early users have not seen this before, and we have not used our wallets to sign it).

&#x200B;

Now, I want to ask the project the following questions:

&#x200B;

1.Why weren't these changes announced or mentioned in the Roadmap for the community to know, but were automatically notified and changed (if the project can automatically change the price 4 times, then it is entirely possible for them to decrease it to 0.1 APT)?

2.Why did you let early users create such high-priced domain names? If you want more users and better service, why not make the domain creation fee 20 APT from the beginning?

3.Why do early users who created domain names in 2022 not receive any compensation and not even get their domain names extended?

4. You reduced the domain name price by 4 times, why only compensate for 1 year :))

&#x200B;

A blockchain project community always emphasizes decentralization and equality. However, projects are becoming more centralized, and users are losing their rights.\* => My guess and that of early users is that they intentionally did not allow early users to renew or compensate for their beautiful domain names. I wouldn't be surprised if in the future, they require domain owners in 2022 to pay 200 APT to maintain them :)). But it must be said that a project with a professional team working like this makes me very disappointed.

&#x200B;

I HOPE MY ARTICLE AND MANY PEOPLE WILL HELP YOU AVOID SIMILAR PROJECTS.

The next big memecoin? $BRICK: A solid microcap token with 100x potential backed and vetted by a $10 billion corporation,0,11kfni9,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/11kfni9/the_next_big_memecoin_brick_a_solid_microcap/,5,"The ability to trade BRICK on mainnet from testnet was recently enabled, and has already climbed 800% in the last 30 days.  With only a $2,800,000 marketcap, I believe this native Reddit community point token has huge potential.

$BRICK was initially developed by Reddit for r/fortniteBR as a new way for people to be rewarded for their contributions to the r/fortniteBR community.  r/FortniteBR prohibits the transferring or selling of $BRICK acquired within the r/fortniteBR community.  This essentially has created two versions of $BRICK:  The internal version, found within the r/fortniteBR community, and the external tradable version found on sushi.com and RCPswap.com (Reddit Community Points swap).  This has produced the effect of locking the internal community supply as it‚Äôs unable to be sold.

What makes the external and tradable version of $BRICK an ideal candidate for the next memecoin is the fact it‚Äôs back by Reddit, a company valued in 2021 at $10 Billion.  Reddit likely spent tens of millions of dollars hiring coders and analyzing $BRICK to make sure risk was absolutely minimized to near zero.

To put this into perspective, r/cryptocurrency MOONs has been available for several months now on a major exchange (Mexc) and has since climbed to a marketcap of $22,000,000.  At the present time BRICK is not yet listed on any major exchanges, is difficult to buy, and only has a marketcap of $2,800,000.  If BRICK ever gets to the same Marketcap as MOON, this will be a 8x return on investment, meaning a $500 investment now would be worth $4,000.

The process of buying BRICK is a bit complicated, but I can break it down.  It took me several hours to figure it out, but the whole process should only take you about 10 minutes following the step by step below.  Feel free to comment with any questions.

Step 1. Download the MetaMask Wallet App and follow the in app prompts to set up your initial wallet.

Step 2. Make sure you have Ethereum in your MetaMask wallet.  You can purchase ETH with a debit card by clicking ‚ÄúETH‚Äù under your token list, then clicking ‚ÄúBuy‚Äù

Step 3.  In your MetaMask wallet browser, visit [chainlist.org](https://chainlist.org), scroll down and search networks for ‚ÄúArbitrum Nova‚Äù then select ‚Äúconnect wallet‚Äù.

Step 4. In your MetaMask wallet browser, visit orbiter.finance.  ‚ÄúToken‚Äù at the top should be ‚ÄúETH‚Äù.  ‚ÄúFrom‚Äù should be Ethereum.  ‚ÄúTo‚Äù should be ‚ÄúArbitrum Nova‚Äù.  Input the amount of Ethereum you‚Äôd like to swap and press ‚ÄúSend‚Äù.

Step 5. In your MetaMask browser, visit either [Sushi.com](https://sushi.com) or [RCPswap.com](https://RCPswap.com).  

Sushi Instructions: 
Visit [Sushi.com](https://Sushi.com) and click ‚ÄúEnter App‚Äù in the top right corner.  The top token should be ‚ÄúETH‚Äù and search for BRICK for your bottom token.  Input the amount of ETH you‚Äôd like to swap for BRICK, and press ‚Äúswap‚Äù.

RCPswap Instructions:
The top token should be ‚ÄúETH‚Äù and the bottom token should be ‚ÄúBRICK‚Äù.  Input the amount of ETH you‚Äôd like to swap for BRICK, and press ‚Äúswap‚Äù.

You now own BRICK!  Follow the same steps in reverse whenever you want to sell.

Again, a bit complicated, but if you follow the step by step instructions you‚Äôll see it‚Äôs pretty self explanatory.  Comment with any questions and I‚Äôll help walk you through.

Most of them are useful in some way and work as they should, but somehow they have disastrous shortcomings and they also address only one peculiar feature of privacy protection.

Only private messaging (often very limited, with only text messages available) is what anonymous messengers have to offer in the market. Find another app if you want to do something different while maintaining your privacy. And the situation is the same with all private solutions. Each task obliges a different application. Naturally, this greatly reduces users' desire to be serious about their privacy.

Although slightly different, VPN services that track all your device traffic also have known vulnerabilities. VPNs are useful, but not satisfactory for privacy. To solve this and other privacy issues, UtopiaP2P offers a complete solution by offering a fully anonymity-proof ecosystem. Everything is absolutely anonymous and undetectable, including messaging, data transfers, financial transactions, and multiplayer games. 

The UtopiaP2P ecosystem assurances freedom of expression. A third party cannot intercept or read any communication or data. All user account information is stored by Utopia in an encrypted file on its local device.UtopiaP2P is a product powered by freedom, anonymity, and the uncensored Internet without borders, designed for secure communication and anonymous payments. Utopia is designed to stop things like full surveillance, information flow control, and official deception. 

The protection of all human rights, including the right to privacy of communication and freedom of expression, is one of the core values ‚Äã‚Äãof Utopia P2P. With this manifesto, Utopia hopes to uphold these human values ‚Äã‚Äãand lay a solid foundation for them in the high-tech society of the future.

**The UtopiaP2P privacy Ecosystem is made up of the following components:**

**1** Utopia P2P is the first privacy project to provide this extensive service thanks to its Proof-of-Stake and Proof-of-Resources blockchain. They already have two cryptocurrencies called the Crypton coin (CRP) and Utopia USD (UUSD). Listed on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. Besides, it is already accepted as payment method on 1858 websites and services, with more to come.

**2** Layer 1 network dedicated to privacy.

Utopia P2P provides exchange, mining robot, mobile app, desktop app, and many other features for anonymous communication, crypto cards, untraceable cryptocurrency transactions or exchanges, anonymous network, secure data transmission, private web browser 3.0, and many other applications.

The StrikeX Ecosystem - Due Diligence,17,11a5cqj,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/11a5cqj/the_strikex_ecosystem_due_diligence/,17,"Hey there! Let me introduce you to StrikeX, their existing products, and all the exciting developments they have in the works.

First up, TradeStrike Lite (V1), which was the first product that was released. It's an application that allows users to stake their tokens for a variable ~10% return, with no lock-in commitment. It's a great option for current holders to benefit from staking rewards while the DEX v2 is being built from scratch. This sets it apart from other DEXs which are just carbon copies of each other. The long-awaited v2 is coming in just a few days and I can‚Äôt wait!

Security & self-custody have been all the rage in the Crypto industry lately and StrikeX have this at the forefront of their vision. Their DeFi wallet was released at the end of 2022 and supports BSC, SOL, BTC, and ETH blockchains, allowing for multi-chain support, integral swaps, portfolio & asset charting, and instant fiat deposits and withdrawals through the integration of the transak and Mercuryo payment gateways (with more on the way!). It's supported on both android and iOS and has an in-built biometric login for added security. There is a ‚Äúconveyor belt‚Äù of upgrades lined up, such as NFT galleries, ledger compatibility, staking compatibility and additional network integrations, which is sure to make it the most extensive DeFi Wallet on the market.

TradeX is the fully functional V2 of their DEX, which is coming in February 2023. This new version is going to be the most comprehensive of its kind, including a fiat on-ramp, proper charting (think tradingview), order books, limit orders, and much more. You can find a demo of TradeX on StrikeX's social media platforms, but it won‚Äôt be long until you can try it out yourself!

Now, let's talk about the flagship product: TradeStrike. This is what the team set out to deliver from the beginning because of the inconvenience of traditional stock trading platforms. TradeStrike, which is due for release in 2023, will be a 24/7 trading platform that allows users to trade stocks, cryptocurrencies, NFTs, real estate, and more all in one app through the use of blockchain technology and tokenisation. All assets will be backed 1/1 with the real-world asset, and the STRX token acts as a gateway to all assets tradable on the platform. The team have been working with one of the biggest law firms on the planet, Latham & Watkins, to ensure compliance and regulation from the start. We can expect to receive a lot more information regarding this in the coming months, once all existing products are rolled out and up to date. 

Let‚Äôs not forget that while the main function of the $STRX token will be its utility within the Trading Platform, Stock Token Bridge & Blockchain, there is also 10% of the company (presumably in the form of a Tokenised asset) up for grabs to for the top 10% of holders upon launch of the trading platform. This creates a huge opportunity to get in early and be a part of the movement away from traditional finance! 

But that's not all! StrikeX is growing their web3 ecosystem and has started developing their own POA blockchain, X-Chain, with advancements in encryption standards and additional safety controls. The $STRX token will become the native currency of the network used in all transactions and gas fees.

And there's even more! StrikeX has been working on a stock token bridge that will allow for the seamless transfer of traditional stocks to tokenized versions that can be traded on the TradeStrike platform. This means users will have access to a wider range of assets, including those that are not yet tokenized, making the platform even more comprehensive. Plus, the stock token bridge will provide a new level of accessibility to traditional stock markets, eliminating the need for intermediaries and reducing costs associated with traditional stock trading. The bridge is still in development, and we are yet to find out the finer details, but the team is working hard to make it a game-changer in the industry.

Overall, the StrikeX ecosystem has a lot of exciting developments in the works, from their DeFi wallet and DEX to their upcoming trading platform and blockchain technology. Their focus on compliance and regulation, as well as their commitment to user security, make them a promising player in the world of cryptocurrency and finance. Keep an eye out for more!

Is Kryxivia going to disrupt the Play & Earn Web 3 Industry ? & Why ?,10,115lcq5,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/115lcq5/is_kryxivia_going_to_disrupt_the_play_earn_web_3/,7,"Play to earn, Play & Earn, GameFi. Call it whatever you want, but it was the main trend in the previous bull market, and now everyone thinks it dead.

Well its not ! Building a real game, with the likes of World of war craft, Apex, Call of Duty etc. takes years and millions if not billions of dollars in investment and more importantly it takes time!

Kryxivia was one of the games that actually launched during the bull market however, the game development takes so long since they are building a high quality game, and finally launched their game on January 13th !

You can check the game out here :

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3m427aOhXI&t=1s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3m427aOhXI&t=1s)

Why Kryxivia is going to disrupt ?

Besides the games quality, as it has a lot of room of improvement. The most important part is the model.

Kryxivia is Free to play , as a player you don't invest money in an NFT or even buying any token in order to play, you just go to their website : [www.kryxivia.io](https://www.kryxivia.io/) either download the launcher (for best quality) or if you want try it on webGL on your google chrome or similar browser, but the best experience is through their launcher.

With that free to play, the game have gained more than 5,000 players in less than 1 month, with almost no marketing, all have been organic & word of mouth. Which actually lead them to partner with the largest guild in Poland.

Ok so what's differentiating Kryxivia from others ? The company isn't focusing on going after SEA or mass markets where you get on grinders, nor it is promising anyone to make a complete living by playing a ""Game"". The majority of their players are in Europe & North America , which are actually spenders in games, and known as users that spend hours and hours playing for fun!

Which exactly explains why when you go to YouTube right now and type Kryxivia, you will see bunch of US, Spanish, European individuals creating tutorials and videos playing the game, and that proves that Kryxivia is a game that players actually love and enjoy that is leading them to start selling NFTs and generating revenue.

DYOR!! GameFi/Play&Earn is going to be a major adoption channel for web3, and only really good games that player enjoy are going to drive this adoption !!

I'm so excited to share with you a project that I believe has the potential to revolutionize the way we think about decentralized computing: Cudos.

Cudos aims to build a decentralized network that provides scalable, secure, and cost-effective computing resources to businesses and individuals worldwide. What sets Cudos apart is its unique approach to utilizing the unused computing power of devices like smartphones and gaming PCs, turning them into a global supercomputer. This not only addresses the issue of centralized data centers having a monopoly on computing power, but it also offers a more sustainable solution by reducing the carbon footprint caused by these data centers.

- Build human-centric Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)
- Issue your own token and allow users staking it in a DAO linked with their unique identities
- Coordinate token-holders using quadratic tokenomics and one-person-one-vote governance
- Use Idena Oracles as a decentralized gateway to real world data

Ultra Brings Crypto To The Masses: Potential 100x Bagger About To Launch Games Marketplace,2,10vl2u8,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/10vl2u8/ultra_brings_crypto_to_the_masses_potential_100x/,0,"This is about Ultra (https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ultra)

If you are looking for a new potential 10 to 100 bagger, then listen up. After launching in 2019, Ultra has now their own NFT marketplace with 2000 listings already.

Anyhow, Ultra is ABOUT TO release a Games marketplace. What is so special about it? Firstly, you own your games and can resell them at any time. Secondly, they will have exclusive games that are considered Play-to-earn games much like Axie infinity. If you recall, Axie infinity was worth 10B at one point. Yes, now consider what an entire platform of NFT/P2E games can achieve. The sky is the limit here!

If you want to review the platform but dont have time to download it, check out my full NFT marketplace review: https://www.howtoguides.org/Ultra.io-Brings-NFTs-And-P2E-Games-To-The-Masses-Powered-by-UOS-Currency

Last but not least, Ultra has no transaction fees, meaning you can sell or buy NFTs at no extra cost. That is why I believe that Ultra has a real chance to become a viable Steam competitor in the near future.

Hope this helps, Good luck! Kucoin is not very liquid, but dont let that get in your way of accumulating some. Binance has a small info listing but might list when they release their games marketplace. This marketplace is currently in closed beta, so give it a few months and dont sell with regret if it moves against you.",2023-02-06 17:00:27,1675724427.0
Tips for Earning a Positive Return When Investing in Cryptocurrency,3,10v11x9,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/10v11x9/tips_for_earning_a_positive_return_when_investing/,0,"Without thorough analysis, cryptocurrency trading can be difficult and risky. Calculating your cryptocurrency ROI, or Return on Investment, is the best way to assess the performance of your upcoming investments. 

There are a few guidelines to follow to make sure you are investing wisely if you want a positive return. In order to invest in cryptocurrencies, consider the following five tips: 

 **1.** **Pick your platform carefully:**   You can see that without taking transfer of funds, deposit, and conversion fees into account, simple ROI calculations cannot accurately predict how much money you will make.  

 **2.** **Make a variety of investments:**  The risk involved in trading with cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and other digital assets can be reduced by putting small sums of money into a larger pool of cryptocurrencies. Don‚Äôt be afraid to put $10 into a fresh NFT project you come across. 

 **3.** **Pick initiatives that will bring in passive income:**   Nothing is more enjoyable than waiting for income to come to you while you‚Äôre relaxing at home. You can buy assets with cryptocurrency that can generate a small income just by keeping the coin.  

 **4.** **Manage the risks:** Even though diversifying your cryptocurrency holdings is a smart move, it doesn‚Äôt mean you should just buy any project you come across. Analyse each project to reduce risk.  

 **5.** **Keep calm:** Not least of all, you must develop patience if you want to trade in the cryptocurrency market. Remember that cryptocurrency prices fluctuate daily and can sometimes go up and sometimes down.

Bulls or bears? Is this really important in the long term?,55,10kt4xv,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/10kt4xv/bulls_or_bears_is_this_really_important_in_the/,37," 

As an investor, it can be challenging to navigate the ever-changing crypto market. One of the most debated topics is whether the market is currently in a bull or bear phase. However, it‚Äôs important to note that it‚Äôs not as crucial to focus on this as opposed to following current trends, allowing you to make investment decisions accordingly.

One strategy that I personally employ is to focus on mid-cap projects that have been active during the bear market and contain potential for growth in specific sectors. For example, some of my best investments have been in projects such as OCEAN, UTK, and QRDO (not financial advice).

OCEAN is a project that I believe has great potential in the AI (Artificial Intelligence) sector, as even many ""big"" influencers are bullish in this space. My own rule is to avoid investing in projects that stagnate during the bear market, and OCEAN has definitely been building a lot in the past year. I‚Äôm confident that it will go much higher in the bull run.  
[https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ocean-protocol](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ocean-protocol)

UTK is another project that I believe has great potential. They‚Äôve been changing their tokenomics and adding more utility to the token while also adding some fantastic partnerships, such as Lugano's use of Utrust infrastructure for crypto payments. Even though there isn't much hype about the crypto payment sector, it has been gradually growing for several years now.  
[https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/utrust](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/utrust)

Lastly, QRDO is a project that I believe has tremendous potential for institutional investors in crypto. They offer different solutions for managing assets and have been busy in the past year. I expect to see many big partnerships in the future.

**Utopia p2p ecosystem** offers users a number of tools and services, such as encrypted communication, secure file-sharing, anonymous email service, privacy payment or trading, gaming, P2E, lottery, privacy web 3.0 browser, and much more. Users of Utopia p2p can benefit from a variety of cutting-edge, decentralized, and futuristic services while remaining anonymous and secure. The ecosystem creates Utopia USD stablecoin (UUSD), which is the first ever and only privacy stablecoin, in the entire cryptocurrency market. Listed on the CMC and CG.

The serverless peer-to-peer blockchain used by Utopia, which powers an all-in-one kit for anonymous web browsing, voice calling, encrypted email, and secure instant messaging, serves as the foundation for the UUSD stablecoin. The Utopia USD (UUSD) is meant to remain at a parity of 1:1. UUSD offers a quick, anonymous, secure, and liquid payment option. The available supply of UUSD is equal to the value of the DAI cryptocurrency collateral, which is publicly verifiable via the cold wallet address.

The initial supply is stored in an Ethereum wallet at address 0x2Cf6717fA2C1fea68F4bdedC26B578898651C270 and is supported by a total of 1,000,000 USD and 1,000,000 DAI.

&#x200B;

 **The Characteristics of Utopia USD (UUSD)**

It does not divulge any identifying information to its blockchain and by default supports anonymous transactions.

It completely makes it's past untraceable. Every transaction is completely private, and no metadata is ever made public.

The level of untraceable transactions offered by this cryptocurrency is currently unmatched.

&#x200B;

Competing private cryptocurrencies rely on obfuscation methods rather than true anonymization, making them susceptible to tracking tools like those provided by CipherTrace. UUSD is built on genuine anonymization that's resistant to tracking tools. Market-making algorithms supported Utopia USD's (UUSD) liquidity on a number of exchanges, including Crypton Exchange, where conversion is possible at a rate with almost no transaction costs.  Crypton Exchange is a natively integrated anonymous crypto exchange with instant deposits and automated withdrawals.

What do you think about these hyped projects for 2023?,7,zyvhku,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/zyvhku/what_do_you_think_about_these_hyped_projects_for/,32," Hello everyone.  


Every once in a while I do some research here and there, to see which crypto projects are more hyped and talked about. Remember, I'm not saying these are good projects or have strong fundamentals, just that I believe they are more hyped than the others. So they can be a good investment, or a bad one.  


This time I found these:  


1. The obvious ones which are almost always hyped: BTC, ETH, BNB, Doge, Matic and ADA. We all know about them, so let's focus mostly on the others.  
2. Polkadot (DOT)  
3. ApeCoin (APE)  
4. Dash 2 Trade (D2T): This one's not still in exchanges, but supposedly it's a strong crypto platform, and hyped.  
5. The Graph (GRT)  
6. NEAR Protocol (NEAR)  
7. Decentraland (MANA)  


So which one of them do you think will perform better in future? If you have any opinion for (or against) anyone of those, I'll be glad to hear it.

However, when we compared the amount of FUD we‚Äôre getting with general market prices, we‚Äôre standing pretty strong. Imagine if anyone had brought up the Binance FUD 1 or 2 years ago‚Ä¶ we‚Äôd definitely be down by 50% in terms of the entire crypto market cap amount. Not to mention FTX, Terra Luna, and every other big or small event that was pulling us down throughout 2022.   


War and recession are potentially imminent as well, but hard to predict. BTC, in my opinion, will not fall below $13,000 (\~30% lower than now). I‚Äôm placing my buy orders now and starting with my DCA (Dollar Cost Average) plan.   


Timing the absolute bottom, as well as one specific sector that will be overhyped, is pretty much impossible. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôd rather choose to DCA from this point on and have diversified my portfolio.  


 

Below are a few altcoins I‚Äôve kept an eye on for some time (not financial advice): 

**EGLD**

This layer-1 blockchain was extremely profitable for me in 2021 - I‚Äôll be buying it again with it for the next bull run. The price is currently around $36 and a large number of projects are built on the chain, compared to the ATH of close to $500 when it only had a few projects. You can even stake EGLD to earn between 9‚Äì10%, making it easier to hold until the next bull run.

[https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/multiversx](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/multiversx)  


**UTK**

Speaking of the MultiverseX chain without mentioning Utrust would be a waste, as they‚Äôre currently undergoing the same rebranding as Elrond. They received a checkmark for operating in the USA, so due to their CEO‚Äôs connection with eBay, I wouldn't be surprised to see some big deals next year. There are many more things in the pipeline, such as a token burn, which will reduce supply to 250 million coins. With an APY of 25-28%, it can also be staked to hedge against potential price declines and earn passive income.

[https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/utrust](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/utrust)  


**METIS**

This is the only layer-2 project for me for the upcoming bull run. I can't give you any other reason besides Vitalik's mom being the owner of the project‚Ä¶ since we know how Vitalik talked about how layer-2‚Äôs will be essential, I have a feeling that ""his"" project will be pumped. Not to mention it's a 20x from the ATH, so even if it returns back to that level, it will be extremely profitable for me. I also see some crazy rates for staking on BakerySwap, so it looks like a potential winner to me.

[https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/metis-token](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/metis-token)  


 

**POOP**

I know it sounds funny but it‚Äôs actually not a meme coin. The name of the project is Raresama, aiming to become the OpeanSea of the Polkadot ecosystem. This is part of my moon bag, whether you call it a low cap or a moonshot.

Best wallet for altcoins ?,3,zqklch,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/zqklch/best_wallet_for_altcoins/,11,"Throughout the years I have just been holding bitcoin and ethereum in a non-custodial wallet but now I have decided to diversify my portfolio.  
There are a lot of potential altcoins out there and I have picked up a few. Storing altcoins on an exchange id obviously not the right thing to do.  
While I know that hardware wallet would be the best place to store altcoins I want to know other options as well.  


Thinking about long term perspective.

1. For now, I have been thinking to store them on a non-custodial wallet but then again which wallet should it be ? My choice would be Exodus but let me know which one is best.  
2. Would it better to store different altcoins in different wallets or decrease the hassle of maintaining different wallets and settle down with just one with all the coins.

Transparency in private DeFi,23,zpp9wk,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/zpp9wk/transparency_in_private_defi/,31,"2022 has seen the strengthening of scalability and security of blockchains at the technology layer, such as the Ethereum merge and Cardano Vasil fork. Almost exactly oppositely, we saw centralized institutions like FTX, 3AC, and Celsius fail spectacularly leaving users and investors without remedy. 2022 was one of the worst years in crypto in both price drawdowns and startling breakdowns of trust. However, these collapses hold an important lesson: we are here to build systems that don‚Äôt need trust and cannot be affected by trust breakdown on a technological level. These systems need widespread adoption, not just from crypto nerds but from the normies, your mum, your dad, your barista, your banker, or your manager. For this to occur, we need privacy to be built into all systems because these groups would not be comfortable with their entire transaction history and balances being broadcast every time they buy something or get a loan.

Foremost, enabling information transparency is one of the biggest promises of blockchain technology, which provides a fully auditable and valid ledger of transactions. A blockchain is a transparent register in which anyone can join the network and, as a result, view all information on that network.

Transparency in crypto means that every action and transaction is publicly stored on the blockchain. It can be easily matched by public ledgers using explorers such as etherscan.io or blockchain.info until the end of time. It may be simple to ignore privacy as an individual when purchasing, sending, and transacting digital assets. However, because transaction patterns can be matched, anyone can track blockchain transactions on public blockchain ledgers using explorers such as blockchain.info and etherscan.io, which potentially puts you at risk. I would wish to pay for a service without revealing any transaction details that could expose me to theft, blackmail, or other nefarious actors.

Bitcoin and the blockchain paved the way for anonymity, control, and security within a largely insecure public infrastructure. However, there is still progress to be made to reach the full potential of anonymity and control in cryptocurrency at the moment. IMO, the future of cryptocurrency revolves around privacy, and while there are popular privacy tokens such as Monero and Zcash, the zero-knowledge proof technology has become extremely popular, with both Zk-SNARKs and Zk-STARKs frequently utilized to obfuscate and maintain anonymity currently. There are subjective views and sentiments about these technologies. These solutions are great for holding and privately transferring value, however, they lack DeFi functionality and you are exposed to the market price of ZEC and XMR. Not exactly ideal for the long-term management of finances.

Railgun is a smart contract privacy protocol that is deployed directly on Ethereum, BSC, and Polygon. From what I understand, it allows users to interact with smart contracts privately and is thus composable with dApps without needing any bridges (which is a security risk). I‚Äôve had a play around with it and think it has the potential to bring privacy to DeFi which might be a bigger issue as more and more people adopt DeFi.

RAIL is the governance token for Railgun DAO and might as well be among the best-performing privacy-focused altcoins in 2023. One to watch!

Utopia is about actual confidentiality and offers two cryptocurrencies: Crypton coin (CRP) and Utopia USD (UUSD). To create a personal account, you do not need to provide your phone number or email address.

The Utopia P2P ecosystem's monetary unit and digital currency are the Crypton (CRP). It is a decentralized cryptocurrency with instantaneous, irrevocable, and entirely untraceable transactions. The Peer-to-Peer network of Utopia P2P promptly and without delay confirms transactions whenever Crypton is sent.

Utopia p2p create the first anonymous stablecoin in the cryptocurrency industry called Utopia USD stablecoin (UUSD). It is based on the P2P serverless blockchain of Utopia. Both Crypton coin and UUSD are listed on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko.

No centralized or decentralized authority has the ability to reverse a transaction on the Utopia peer-to-peer network. Authorities cannot seize cryptocurrency balances stored in uWallets, not even for purposes of identification. Utopia p2p cryptocurrency transactions are completely anonymous and are not recorded on the blockchain. Newly minted Cryptons are distributed every 15 minutes to nodes who support and uphold the highest standards for the network.

In response, some in the crypto community are calling for a return to its decentralized roots.

Among the rallying cries of this latent movement: ‚ÄúNot your keys, not your coins.‚Äù

In other words: Trust only yourself.

But doing so requires individuals to maintain their own cryptocurrency wallets through a more complicated ‚Äî if safer ‚Äî process that involves generating complex passwords and sometimes buying physical hardware to keep track of crypto, as opposed to entrusting it to an exchange.

""A company like FTX was supposed to hold your assets, but they ended up lending them out,"" Tracy Wang, deputy managing editor at the crypto news site CoinDesk, told NBC News.

That concept is what undergirds the traditional monetary system and seems to go against the fundamental philosophy of cryptocurrency.

""This is like taking power back and being in charge of your own money,"" Wang said of decentralization.

So does that mean that Utopia P2P had chosen the right way from the very beginning, being based on its own decentralized blockchain and having own Crypton privacy coin? As for the 5 years of existence it didn't face any data leakage or scamming scandal. Or what else would you offer to pay attention to?

It was one of the refelection token. Their goal was to combine the DEX and CEX world for all the reflection tokens out there and to generate trading volume by creating utilities. WAS is what I'm stressing here.

Some days ago the CEO came out and said that they had to drain liquidity since they were afraid that [deeplock.io](https://deeplock.io), the company Y5 had their tokens locked with, is a scam and would try to drain the liquidity of the Y5WT token (there are two different tokens, y5wt and y5tt, to simplify things we'll disregard y5tt token and will call the other token just y5). Whoever is interested can find the video on their discord and telegram. So step 1) circumvent the whole idea behind locking the tokens. Already a great start.

Then, a couple of days later he came out with another statement, namely that the project would completely change the direction and actually would be become something that is just used by the other one, MSV, a token that came out just like a month ago  and is used by a so-called decentralized social media platform, without anyone being capable of explaining what makes it so decentralized. Which becomes even funnier now since all the changes/decisions were made by a core team of like , oh, I don't know, 5 people.

And then they sold everyone this genious Idea, both liquidity pools for MSV and Y5 will be put together and people are supposed to send their Y5 tokens to a certain adress and will get airdropped the new token 1 to 1 with an additional 25% on top of it. Just so that you know, the buying/selling tax was at 20%, so those 25% are basically there to compensate for that. No explanation was given on how the distribution will look like, no option to opt out was given as the liquidity was drained overnight.

edit: forgot to mention an interesting detail, the founder and CEO of y5 switched over to MSV just like a month before all of that happened. That swtich was also not communicated and investors were just suddenly informed after the effecively switched over to the other project.

Yeah, that's basically It, just wanted to share it somewhere, where the y5 ""officials"" won't be able to take it down easily. I've checked all the Altcoin Rules and I don't think I'm breaking any of them.

Here is the required CMC link, just look at that graph in case you'll ever think about investing one of their projects: [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/y-5-finance/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/y-5-finance/)

***The next part is more for those that are invested in y5.***

If you want an explanation of what's happened in 1 sentence, I couldn't sum it up better than **Keith034: ""They‚Äôve basically rugged Y-5 to feed MSV.""**

1. There was still 0 evidence presented that [deeplock.io](https://deeplock.io) was draining liquidity. Evidence! Not what we got: ""lookz on teh internetz"".
2. Y5 gets merged into a different project without the consent of the investors overnight. And then it's also sold as some genious idea. Mind you MSV is assimilating y5, not the other way around.
3. The main selling point of y5 was the ""bringing DEX and CEX worlds together"". Creating the CEX environment for reflection tokens, brining in Fiat trading. Now, that's completely killed, getting regulated is out of the question.
4. No explanation on what merging with MSV actually means for the tokens. Everyone gets a 1 for 1 of the tokens with a 25% bonus (the 25 are just there to cover the buy fee) but how many MSVT tokens were in circulation? What was the price in comparison to y5? There was already a question on telegram, asking what would happened if you were holding 1% of the WT supply, whether you'd still hold 1% of the total supply. The answer was obviously no but without any details on that.
5. If someone really got some ""Decentralization"" or ""Security"" comming from the team, which I guess are +- the same people for both y5 and MSV, you should honestly stop taking those pills. Or maybe start, depending on the circumstances. All the decisions were made by the very core.  All security protocols that should be there to protect investors from being rugged, were circumvented.
6. If you really think serious investors will put money into a project that can rug the liquidity overnight, you're delusional. What prevents the y5/MSV team from doing the same stunt again the next time they'll decide to move money to the next project they like? Yeah, you guessed it right, nothing.
7. At least I was able to withdrew 10k about 3 month ago, so it's not all that painful but people that bought close to the ATH are meanwhile 99% down. Still, I'm sure there are still a lot of ""I trust in the team"" people around. Who is the team, like really, who are they? The only guys I'm aware of are the ones from the Albany Group, in case they're still even supporting that. None of them mentions Y5 on their LinkedIn profile. For the others, who are the others? What are their linked in profiles? What's their experience prior to y5? We already know there are no full time devs working on the project, everything was made by some 3rd party company. I will ask stewart on LinkedIn to see whether Albany Group is still behind all that's happening to the project.
8. There are claims that Blockchain is being built but yet again no details. Which company is doing it?",2022-11-27 13:17:38,1669576658.0

[gamefi]What is the X-Metaverse and how to make money by playing it,2,z3fazv,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/z3fazv/gamefiwhat_is_the_xmetaverse_and_how_to_make/,7,"There are few games that remain extremely active in the midst of a crypto winter - the X-Metaverse is one such game. Launched in May 2022, this community-favorite online interstellar warfare strategy card game has been praised for its intense battles, subtle strategy combinations, and diverse nurturing gameplay.  
This article reveals information about X-Metaverse gameplay and how to profit from it, as well as a host of other interesting facts.

**X-Metaverse official address on BNB Chain**  
**0xb080171c8999c336cc115d4d8224c2de51657a1c**

**6 Ways to Make Money on the X-Metaverse**

X-Metaverse is tailored for hardcore gaming enthusiasts who want a thrilling experience in the metaverse. Players can earn money by playing X-Metaverse and feeling the adrenaline rush. The game's pilots and space battleships are economic assets in the X-Metaverse, earning income from activities such as interstellar combat, racing, mining resources and trading.

The most common way for new players to earn money on the X-Metaverse is to actually play the game. As you play, you will receive XMETA in-game tokens and generous amounts of in-game materials. The easiest strategy for gaining these in-game earnings is to use up your energy in PVE and PVP modes.

1.PVE mode

By completing PvE levels, you can earn up to 400 energy cores per day, which is worth about $1.17, and if you stick with it for a month you can get a price of more than $30. This is the most stable game since gamefi 6 months, he brought me a few months of stable income, is my lunch and I am very grateful to X-Metaverse.

2. PVP mode

You need to spend effort to participate in arena battles. You can fight bosses to get gems to set in your battleship to increase your combat power, so you can get a higher PVP ranking, your ranking will determine how much XMETA you can win. That's an average of nearly $125 a week, which is a huge amount of money for an average family. The extra tip is that you can PVP every day between 6:00-8:00 UTC and 18:00-20:00 UTC each PVP win will give you an extra 6 points, which will give you an even bigger advantage. If you want more points you can also duel during this time!

3. Space Jump

You need to put XMETA in your prize pool to race against other players' space battleships, your ranking will determine the percentage of XMETA prize pool you can win, 2-4 minutes to complete a race, the highest prize is up to 55K XMETA, worth $184. It's an exciting race game that makes us excited!

4.Battleship retrofitting and selling

When a space battleship is retrofitted, a new space battleship will be raised and all of its skills and attributes will be changed, and you can either use it for battle or sell it on the market. When you SR retrofit three times with a failed result, you will 100% get 1 SR class space battleship on the 4th battleship retrofit.  
The current market price of N-class space battleship is 1,350 XMETA, worth 4.5 USD, while the minimum cost to perform 1 retrofit is only 34 USD, a gain of over 492.94%, which is a huge ROI, let me answer your last concern for you, the NFT trading market in X-Metaverse recovers SR battleships every day by mysterious forces (I guess maybe it's official , but I'm not sure, that's my guess) I've tried it a few times and it keeps me immersed in battleship retrofits every day.

5. Farm stake Pool

Participants can use XMETA-BUSD LP trading pairs, Space Battleship NFT, Pilot NFT, to stake for rewards, the annualized yield remains above 150%, which is very stable APY has lasted for at least 4 months, the usual round time is 30 days, the latest 1 NFT stake total prize pool is up to 864K XMETA, worth $2,896.

6. Stake DAO

A part of all X-Metaverse revenue is destroyed directly and a part is added to the DAO dividend pool. DAO dividends will directly benefit everyone in the community by participating in staking veXMETA to receive voting rights and game revenue dividends. Dividends are paid every 30 days and distributed based on a percentage of the veXMETA dividend pool holdings, and everyone can initiate proposals to the game to fix some of the illogical structures that are taking the game one step closer to true decentralization. All the concentration of power will be well relieved. That's what I've always admired and trusted about the project, and they've been working hard on the game. I hope it gets better and better! I think the game will become as phenomenal as AXS/MBOX/SSS and will have a high position in the future WEB3 space.

It's all in the game  
From Axie Infinity to the X-Metaverse, blockchain gaming has injected excitement and competition into the space. The advent of blockchain has led to a scenario where a user push economy exists for games. Technology puts players in control, allowing them to make money by using their time, energy and skills effectively in the game.  
What makes this game X-Metaverse amazing is that both newbies and veterans can enjoy this game. They start at level 1 and as they gain levels, experience and gems, they go through complete and exciting space battles.

Or is it a move to make us think that someone is accumulating [$FTT](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FTT&src=cashtag_click) amid the storms?

It is a 100% proof of stake secured by the POS distributed consensus algorithm, and you can earn rewards just by leaving your core desktop wallet open and connected to the network. What's special about it? The whole Neblio network is entirely controlled by volunteer wallet users who stake NEBL to create new blockchain blocks and authenticate each network transaction. Luckily, I learned about this project at an early stage from its listing at MEXC they listed it yesterday, and it went up 100%. Nebilo already has 95k+ wallet downloads and is still going strong, so I think having some in our wallets has great potential. Just my views, #NFA can research about it and grab some from MEXC.

Free Chainlink Due Diligence Report,6,ym81o1,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/ym81o1/free_chainlink_due_diligence_report/,2,"Hi all,

To kick off my Patreon, I posted a free Chainlink due diligence report. For those of you who don't want to check out the report, here is a quick summary of my findings:

This project, being one of the highest profile top 30 coins, has access to the best talent in the industry, and if Sergey Nazarov really is Satoshi Nakamoto, then Chainlink *certainly* has an impressive team behind it. If that weren‚Äôt enough, it has one of the most viable use cases of any coin in existence and truly is critical to the success of digital assets. The launch allocated the coins fairly (much less was allocated to the company than on some other projects) and the maximum supply is nice to see as it is conducive to price appreciation. Conversely, it remains to be seen if a fixed supply will be successful for a transactional coin of this type since early investors will end up holding most of the purchasing power. The project is dominant within it‚Äôs category and has garnered strong support from investors, which propelled it higher than many other top 30 coins during the most recent bull run. With that said, LINK is still coupled with BTC, and proved not to be immune to the crypto bear market, still getting plowed harder than Bill Gates‚Äô 269,000 acre farmland portfolio and giving up most of its 2021 gains.   

Chainlink has been awarded a total score of 48/60 (80%), categorizing this coin as a **strong buy** with a price expectation during the next bull run of between $86.67 and $114.32 USD.

I hope some people find value in this, or at the very least get a good laugh out of it, as the goal is for the reports to be entertaining as well as informational.",2022-11-04 14:31:13,1667590273.0

Jump Trading, known as one of the biggest Market Makers in cryptocurrency, has just transferred 731.409 [$MASK](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24MASK&src=cashtag_click) (\~$3.4M) to individual wallet 0x419.

**How, Why and What then?** 

Wallet 0x419 showed signs of depositing [$MASK](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24MASK&src=cashtag_click) on CEXs (Binance and OKX) 2 days ago.

This wallet has made no further move after the transaction from Jump Trading.

This brings up a question:

**Do these smart moneys see we are in a sufficiently good** [**$MASK**](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24MASK&src=cashtag_click) **price range with high liquidity, and unlikely to grow further in the near future?** 

For traders, we see this is now a very bad [$MASK](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24MASK&src=cashtag_click) price range for a long position when the whales are showing signs of taking profit, like Jump Trading.

**There is highly possibly a pressure from short positions (a chance for short sellers).**

$IMX High Volatility is Waiting Ahead?,7,yjwq5i,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/yjwq5i/imx_high_volatility_is_waiting_ahead/,3,"# [$IMX](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24IMX&src=cashtag_click) HIGH VOLATILITY AHEAD?

105% [$IMX](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24IMX&src=cashtag_click) circulating and 12.7% total supply (254.862.617 [$IMX](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24IMX&src=cashtag_click)) are going to be unlocked in the upcoming vesting on November 5th, for the investors buying in the private sale.

So what is waiting us all ahead?

**1. Out of** [**$IMX**](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24IMX&src=cashtag_click) **Total Supply:**

* 88% are still locked.
* 8.3% are on the exchanges.
* 1.6% are on the bridges.
* 2.1% are on Ethereum-blockchain wallets.

The [$IMX](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24IMX&src=cashtag_click) circulating and held in individual wallets are still very low. Upcoming unlocking will greatly change [$IMX](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24IMX&src=cashtag_click) whale rankings.

**2. Out of 254.862.617** [**$IMX**](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24IMX&src=cashtag_click) **are going to be unlocked:**

* 134M will be used for developing [$IMX](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24IMX&src=cashtag_click).
* 120M (\~6% total supply, \~$70M) will be sent to private investors buying at $0.1 (ROI +489.4%).

We see a $70M selling pressure from them to avoid risks as this is their first vesting so far. You should be preparing.

**3. Allocation:**

* 77% [$IMX](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24IMX&src=cashtag_click) total supply will be used for its project and ecosystem development, such as improving their protocol, user rewards, development grants, liquidity and marketing plans.
* 75.3% still remain after the upcoming vesting.

Such allocation promises a bright future ahead.

**4. Treasury Wallet:**

* Based on the allocation, this treasury wallet is used for [$IMX](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24IMX&src=cashtag_click) development. 1.5M [$IMX](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24IMX&src=cashtag_click) were deposited on FTX on Oct 30.
* Before that, another wallet getting [$IMX](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24IMX&src=cashtag_click) from this wallet also deposited on Binance.

Good news will come then, indeed there was one shortly after this.

**5. Out of 10** [**$IMX**](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24IMX&src=cashtag_click) **Balance Change Wallets in the past 30 days:**

* Largest withdrawals from the 3 wallets are ranked among 5 [$IMX](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24IMX&src=cashtag_click) largest holders.
* Largest deposits are more equal.

*Please note that the 2M deposit means nothing but a transaction from the treasury above.*

[$IMX](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24IMX&src=cashtag_click) selling pressure in the past 30 days were stronger and mainly came from the whales who cut losses. It was partly digested by smaller holders who are accumulating more [$IMX](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24IMX&src=cashtag_click).

**6. Looking at the 3** [**$IMX**](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24IMX&src=cashtag_click) **Largest Holders**

* 0xf0fa shows signs of dumping recently, with a selling pressure of 8.1M [$IMX](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24IMX&src=cashtag_click).
* 0xd8d6 is cutting loss before the vesting, or this one is in need of some funds for another purpose.
* 0x491f shows no sign.

**5. The Remaining Top Holders:**

* In contrast, others in Top 5 - 20 wallets had been accumulating \~18M [$IMX](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24IMX&src=cashtag_click) since May to August, most of which were created in May 2022.
* They are still showing signs of buying.
* Supply decreased due to their accumulation, but rising demand will better the price.

This upcoming vesting will strongly raise [$IMX](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24IMX&src=cashtag_click) supply, and it does take time for the market to digest such increase.

**So you need to observe more.**

**There are recently 20 new wallets in Top 50 Holders.**

* Interestingly, these wallets were not recently created. They only appeared there out of nowhere.
* This is not a whale accumulation because these wallets have already bought $APT before, with no further move so far.

*=> So we believe this is just an error, which is no surprise as errors happening on* *#Aptos* *are quite frequent. In good news, they are fixing it.*

**There also appears a wallet with 20M** **$APT**\*\*, which equals to the $APT used for the airdrop.\*\*

*=> Could this hint that there may be another airdrop soon?*

**90% of the 1000 wallets airdropped after the due date Oct 25 have been holding their tokens ever since, mysteriously**.

* FYI, these wallets failed to claim $APT due to errors and have to do it on 26 and 27.

1. Selling pressure from the 90% wallets above won't be so strong (\~$3M $APT compared to its $600M trading volume).

Historically, $AXS price plunged when a large number of $AXS were unlocked (\~21M $AXS), as seen below:

* Oct. 30, 2021: fell by 60%.
* Apr. 29, 2022: fell by 50% before sideway.

* [@DeFianceCapital](https://twitter.com/DeFianceCapital) got 160K $AXS, and later sold all on July 1.
* [@arca](https://twitter.com/arca) got 437K $AXS, and later sold all on May 9.

"For a successful P2E game, is gameplay more important, or is making money more important?",2,y7utrz,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/y7utrz/for_a_successful_p2e_game_is_gameplay_more/,7,"Vitalik Buterin shared this take in a recent interview with Wired.

‚ÄúGames like Axie Infinity were really successful last year, but then Axie Infinity got hacked,‚Äù Buterin said. ‚ÄúEven aside from that, it hasn't really been able to recover. The reason for that in my view is that the people who designed these first-generation NFT games approached it with the attitude that the financialization aspect by itself was enough to make the game fun. But that‚Äôs clearly not enough, and a successful NFT or play-to-earn game itself needs to be fun even without the monetization aspect. Whoever figures out how to make a blockchain game that is a fun game first, those are the kinds of projects that are going to win.‚Äù

Recently, X-Metaverse launched a new game Space jump, which is a brand new racing game about space battleships. It is also our latest exploration of P2E. If you are interested, you are very welcome to come and play.

Why is $CATHEON is going to make me a millionaire? (DD included DYOR),3,y1uffr,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/y1uffr/why_is_catheon_is_going_to_make_me_a_millionaire/,11,"After seeing this token pop up on my Twitter multiple times over the last few days I wanted to share this buy-of-the-century opportunity in the blockchain gaming space. SolChicks (first high quality game on Solana) has just announced a rebrand of their single game token to a gaming ecosystem token across 25 games + Steam platform + metaverse project called Catheon Gaming.

The business model is similar to other gaming ecosystems such as Gala, WEMIX and Immutable X with a portfolio of high quality games, and a high degree of vertical integration (ranging from game development to distribution and SDK). Compared to its competitors Catheon is more focused on a publisher / advisory model to convert successful Web2 games to Web3, and has the highest number of quality games among its peers.

While similar gaming ecosystem tokens all trade around \~$1.5 billion fully diluted market capitalization, **SolChicks token (**[**https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/solchicks-token/markets/**](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/solchicks-token/markets/)**) is only $45M now (only \~3% of the price of the competitors), due to temporary mispricing as a single game token, but will be swapped 1 for 1 for Catheon token if it is bought before their snapshot at 1PM UTC on 13 Oct 2022.** With the largest game portfolio and one of the biggest communities (in terms of Twitter following and existing token holders), there‚Äôs no way the Catheon token is valued lower than its peers. Already up \~300% in the last few days. You can check out the details yourself on their website, what do you think?  


EDIT: Just noticed Cointelegraph featured them just a couple days ago [here](https://cointelegraph.com/press-releases/catheon-gaming-announces-the-catheon-gaming-ecosystem).

"It's an open discussion, what are your plans ahead of the coming bull run, are you buying anything now or not?",39,xvdhpi,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/xvdhpi/its_an_open_discussion_what_are_your_plans_ahead/,138,"I remembered the last bear market when a friend advised me to buy ETH, but I was hesitant. My first purchase later was around 3000, and I planned to hold to 10K if possible, but the bear market had other plans. To avoid repeating the same mistake, I've decided to conduct research, compile a list of a few good crypto projects that I believe will lead the next bull run, and then ask you guys to vote on which ones you think are good and which ones you think are bad.

The first on my list is potential Solana. I know some people don't like it because of centralization issues and the fact that it has had a few shutdowns, but I believe it's a great blockchain with a lot of great potential. I have DCA from $60, and I may still buy more. Some advantages of SOL include its high scalability, which makes Solana a better blockchain for Dapps such as DEXs and staking protocols.

The following is DOT. Polkadot should not be overlooked either, as it has a fantastic community. It is designed to allow unrelated blockchains to securely interact with one another, allowing value or data to flow between blockchains without the need for an intermediary. It's also intended to be fast and scalable, thanks to the use of numerous parallel blockchains or ""parachains"", that offload much of the processing demand from the main blockchain. Dot has an ATL of $2.69, so buying at $6.27 now isn't a bad idea. I just want to start DCA-ing DOT this month.

I also discovered a low-cap project called Qanplatform. It's a layer 1 quantum-resistant blockchain, which you may have heard of. It recently released QVM, which allows developers to code smart contracts in any programming language. In comparison to EVM, which only allows programming in Solidity, this could be huge for the crypto space in general. It also has several other USPs, such as the quantum-resistant features I mentioned above, which make this chain one of the most secure ever and not hackable by a Quantum computer. I've had DCA-ing QANX since it was 0.014, and I'll be buying more this month to hold for the long term.

The fourth one is MoonRiver, an Ethereum-compatible, smart-contract parachain on Kusama. It is intended to be a companion network to Moonbeam, where it will provide a permanently incentivized canary network. The token name is MOVR and it has several utilities for this decentralized smart contract platform.  I did buy some for around $15 and am still looking for more if possible.

The last one is a meme called TSUKA. It has the same founder as Shiba and I will be gambling in on that, hopefully, it will become the next Shiba.

So guys, what do you think, I‚Äôm I good to go? Do I need to add any other gem before the bull run, let me know in the comment section

We have been really lucky in securing the services of M1chl to help the project reach the goals and objectives that the team has set.

One of the most important developments has been the success of writing a Mobile wallet for DigitalNote encompassing our wallet encrypted Messaging features. This allows our users to communicate securely with each other in real-time.

The development of the Apps by M1chl has overcome many challenges that we were unable to solve in the past. The App is now available on the Google Play stores and on the Apple Store.

Some of the features that we now have built into the wallet include the following:

Cold Staking ‚Äì This means that you can stake your XDN without having to keep your wallet open to benefit from earning rewards. Another effort in making sure that XDN works toward a greener future.
Withdraw staking rewards ‚Äì This is a feature that allows you to leave your main balance for staking and withdraw the rewards to your ‚Äúspend‚Äù account for purchases or to send XDN to your friends.
Allows for instant payments for purchases of goods and services. This will be a significant benefit to users and merchants that can now have a trustless service to receive funds with an insignificant fee being paid by the purchaser, ensuring the Merchant gets the full value of the purchase price.

Q3 Partnerships

Cavoodle.org

We have secured a significant partnership with Cavoodle.org. They have released just under 300 unique Cavoodle Pup NFTs that have an XDN collar. The significance of this partnership is that we have been gifted 90% of the proceeds on the sale of these NFT‚Äôs to ensure that we can continue to pay for the development of DigitalNote and set up our own supporter‚Äôs club. These pups have been transferred to our developer's account so we are in control of what we do with them. We encourage the XDN community to choose your favorite pup and secure them as soon as possible so that we can continue developing XDN into one of the best Cryptocurrencies for our community. The ‚ÄúWhitelist‚Äù price to the Community will be the same for everyone which is currently just 0.1ETH. The pups are available on Opensea.io 

Rocketbot.pro

The rocketbot.pro partnership is another great development offering XDN exposure to over 100,000 cryptocurrency enthusiasts. This will also include a listing on the Merge wallet with another exciting feature for XDN investors.  XDN holders can spawn an XDN masternode offering higher rewards than staking alone. The benefit of this service Is that you do not have to pay an additional fee to rent a VPS to host your masternode. The cost of hosting the masternode is based on a percentage of the rewards that are earned. More details to follow.

Future Development

With the funds that we hope to secure from the sale of these cute XDN Cavoodle pups, we will allocate to the following:

Development of the Apps to further enhance usability in a Point of Sale environment.
Advertise to attract Cryptocurrency Investors and Merchants.
Provide more opportunities to make our goal ‚ÄúXDN Accepted Here‚Äù a reality.
Set up an XDN NFT Private Pup club similar to BAYC .
Set up a web wallet using the tools and technology that have been used for our Mobile Wallets.
Further, enhance our blockchain and QT wallets to scale even further.
Investigate a DOA using 2XDN on the Binance Smart Chain to help make decisions on future projects. This will help give 2XDN the use case that has been missing.

It really is time for XDN Supporters to start partying!

This collection was created by artist [SphincterBob](https://twitter.com/SphincterbobArt) as an extra incentive for stakers. We‚Äôll have a blog post out later this week with more on the collection and minting process.

xToken Terminal's upcoming Origination app is the easiest way to launch a token offering or crowdfunding campaign,7,xe3trt,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/xe3trt/xtoken_terminals_upcoming_origination_app_is_the/,4,"Small to medium sized teams often do not have the resources or internal  infrastructure to bootstrap their protocols. There's a lot of smart contract work, prone to logic or security issues. There's a lot of UX  work, risking a subpar experience for investors and community.

What are the ingredients for bootstrapping a protocol? 1) financing (raising money) and 2) liquidity. Terminal already solves for #2 with the Mining app, which allows any project to permissionlessly spin up a Uni V3 LM campaign in just a few minutes. With the launch of the Origination app, Terminal will make #1 just as easy.

What can you do with Origination? Launch a token offering (any ERC20) in exchange for any other token (ETH/ERC20), with custom cliff/vesting conditions, dynamic pricing formulas, custom allowlists as easy as uploading a CSV, and much more. You and your community/contributors can benefit from the sleek UX of Origination. All claiming, distribution and vesting managed on chain, freeing you from the intimidating process of launching an offering.

Want awareness? Your offering will line up right next to all the other token offering and liquidity mining campaigns on Terminal.

Curious to learn more? We'd love to begin a conversation with you!

Looking out for projects with solid fundamentals in this bear market,7,wrqyx2,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/wrqyx2/looking_out_for_projects_with_solid_fundamentals/,48,"Is the bear season over or there's still some surprises to come? Personally, I think that whatever green we see now won‚Äôt last long. I know certainly that this current crabby movement will last longer than many expect (I hope I‚Äôm wrong). Until the FOMO resumes, I believe it‚Äôs a good thing to utilize this period to do extensive research and source for the next gem.

In recent times web3, NFT management and support, asset management and security as well as privacy protocols have been receiving major attention. In line with this development, certain projects have come together to form a partnership to integrate two of these sectors. A good example is the recent integration of Open Rights Exchange on Polygon. This integration enables cross chain wallet and NFT management on the Polygon network. 

Speaking of Ore protocol, its contribution to interoperability and easy access to multi chains has surpassed my expectations despite the fact that it is a low cap project. As a matter of fact, it pioneered a product, ORE ID which is an identity management and multichain access tool that can now boast of having over 200,000 active users. Personally, I see this as a milestone, considering the project's market cap. In addition, it's worthy to note that it stayed on the top gainers list on bitmart for weeks especially after the Polygon announcement.

Bifrost is another promising multi-chain project that is well known for developing a structure where developers can build protocols with scalable and flexible dApps. If anyone has been paying attention lately, it‚Äôs quite obvious that a whole lot of developments have been going on in the DeFi space. Hence, the need for developers to tap into the resources of multiple blockchain protocols simultaneously and seamlessly cannot be overemphasized. In this line, Bifrost might as well play a key role in the future of blockchain services and its adoption.

[https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bifrost](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bifrost)

The inference here is that there are hidden projects worth performing excellently but overshadowed by already established high caps and market sentiments.

A little search down the projects making a solid impact in the development of web3 and its adoption, and you‚Äôll find yourself in a pool of gems primed to explode ahead of the next bull run.

Monero's latest network update further boosts transaction source and privacy on an already uncracked system, making it a real challenge for deciphering efforts.

Monero beats Bitcoin on privacy, fungibility, transaction fees, and mining algorithm. Bitcoin beats Monero when it comes to transaction speed, scalability, network effect, supply, and price. Therefore, it's hard to pick a clear winner when comparing these two crypto assets.

After the update on August 13, the number of users has increased significantly, which indicates a great potential for growth and trust in the anonymity of the coin.

However, there are many green cryptos right now. If you are a miner, and care about the energy consumption, cost, and the bad effect on the environment, you can try other mineable cryptos that consume less power, greener, or even more profitable. For example Crypton, the native coin of Utopia P2P.

How to Buy Bitcoin Anonymously,67,we0i1c,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/we0i1c/how_to_buy_bitcoin_anonymously/,23,"Today, most countries of the world provide an opportunity for people to purchase and sell Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies for a profit with almost no restrictions. Despite this, the probability that Bitcoin may be banned in any country is increasing day by day.¬†

These events give crypto traders serious reasons for concern and make the anonymity of investments and trading in Bitcoin one of the most urgent.

In addition to the risk of losing the opportunity to carry out trading operations with Bitcoin in their own country, for many the issue of protecting their savings from tax authorities for personal reasons is also important.

The question concerning how to buy Bitcoin anonymously is asked by people who do not want to disclose their personal data when making transactions.

Using the no KYC Crypton Exchange

Crypton Exchange is a no KYC exchange that is part of the decentralized Utopia P2P ecosystem. It is a platform free from surveillance, censorship, and hacker data leaks. It offers built-in tools for messaging, data transfer, browsing, online payments, mining, etc.

Crypton Exchange is a secure online platform for buying, selling, exchanging, and withdrawing available cryptocurrencies. Registration and the use of the exchange are anonymous and do not require the entry of personal data.

It is a digital offshore that provides anonymous financial transactions. In addition, the platform does not cooperate with other centralized platforms or government agencies, which makes it one of the most independent and private exchanges.

The exchange functions perfectly worldwide and is not afraid of possible blocks by individual countries. Moreover, even if the exchange domain is blocked, it will still be accessible through the ecosystem (one of the advantages of decentralization.)

In addition, Crypton Exchange offers the lowest fees for financial transactions and comprehensive support by a strong Utopia community.

The exchange supports the purchase and sale of several cryptocurrencies:

* Crypton (CRP) is a privacy coin of the ecosystem and its main financial unit
* UUSD is the first stablecoin of the ecosystem
* Monero (XMR) is a popular privacy coin
* Bitcoin (BTC) is an anonymous cryptocurrency

Share your very own crypto trading signals while following others on our decentralized signals marketplace, SanR. A conducive environment to practice your trading skills whilst earning rewards for the eager trader.

SanR runs on consecutive competition cycles called an ‚Äúepoch‚Äù which begins every two weeks along with the lunar cycle. Players compete by measuring their forecasting ability through the signals (price predictions) that they open. Assessing their predictive skills in three different leagues, determining their ‚Äútrader DNA‚Äù.


Every SanR participant competes in all three leagues concurrently:

- Qilin League - Average positive performance (awards overall intuition)

- Dragon League - Total positive performance (awards the lucky strike!)

- Phoenix League - Total negative performance (awards the contrarian position)



The top 10 forecasters in each league will be awarded $SAN tokens once the epoch has concluded. All activities on SanR run inside our proprietary sidechain built on the Ethereum blockchain. Adopting meta-transaction technology into SanR, all actions on the platform are free to use without incurring any gas fees.  SanR keeps an immutable record of crypto price predictions ‚Äì on-chain confirmation of good calls or trades.

By tracking the signals of other participants in the forecasting competition, you will be able to:
* Study the trading decisions of others

* See where consistent winners think the market is headed next

*  Subscribe to SanR's best forecasters. Don't miss their new signals!

*  See what crowd sentiment looks like at any given time

With many new features on the roadmap up to be launched soon, including:
- Intelligence Staking ‚Äì where participants can earn on market forecasting by staking $SAN tokens
- NFT Prizes  ‚Äì collectable NFTs for league winners affecting Intelligence Staking payouts
- And many more to come!

SanR is ready to scale! Help us in introducing the platform to others by showing how much it can benefit your trading skills and knowledge. There will be several iterations on our product development journey. The mission of SanR is to give users clarity about the market and how to assess risks and opportunities.

üçî BurgerCities ($BURGER) Overview,0,w4b4qf,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/w4b4qf/burgercities_burger_overview/,11,"One of the most popular decentralized exchanges on the Binance Smart Chain, BurgerSwap, has decided to expand its ecosystem and present to users a fascinating project that combines all the trends of 2021 ‚Äî the metaverse, DeFi, and NFTs. This direction is called MetaFi and seems to be the next stage in the development of the industry.

https://preview.redd.it/kjpoiskgkvc91.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e56a2feb45beb29323cb6a797e27440d00fd685

### What Is BurgerCities?

[**BurgerCities**](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/burger-cities/) is a metaverse integrated with DeFi and NFTs. As in other metaverses known to users, players will be able to get into virtual reality, in which they can communicate with each other using avatars, travel, participate in battles, complete game quests, and much more. BurgerCities also disposes of a play-to-earn model, thanks to which users who complete quests, combat monsters, and so on can earn tokens and NFTs for their in-game achievements.

But what distinguishes BurgerCities from many existing projects? The participants of the metaverse receive rewards not only in the course of play-to-earn but also via many other economic models. Moreover, users will be able to participate in engaging gameplay as well as use DeFi and NFT services. Players can attend NFT exhibitions and trade NFTs on a peer-to-peer basis. Moreover, trading and staking tools are available to users.  


### BurgerCities Gameplay

Users who want to enter BurgerCities will need BurgerCities NFT heroes, in other words, avatars that will become a visual representation of players in the virtual world. At the moment, the developers hold many events through which you can get The First BC Residents IDENTITY Group and Burger Cities NFT skin. For more information, please navigate to the official Discord of the project.

According to the developers, each NFT Hero is a unique character with its own attributes that can be upgraded during in-game actions.

With the help of their NFT Heroes, users can participate in interactive gameplay, perform everyday tasks and quests and just enjoy the game. In addition, players will be able to participate in battles that have now become more strategic, thanks to a wide range of skills and class combinations. In the future, the developers plan to introduce PVP and PVE gameplay. Trading is also available to users, within which they can swap tokens, in-game exchange resources, and trade NFTs.  


### Black Market

Black Market is a trading interface where users can exchange any tokens almost instantly and with minimal fees. Black Market operates according to the aggregate trading model. Simply put, the platform compares the exchange rates of partner DEXs and CEXs and provides users with the most favorable offer. At the moment, BurgerCities collaborates with leading DEXs, such as PancakeSwap, MDEX, Biswap, Apeswap, BakerySwap, and so on. In addition, the project team recently announced a partnership with the DeFi liquidity protocol iZUMi, which allowed users to provide even more liquidity and competitive exchange rates.  


### Energy Plant

Energy Plant is a section where users can become liquidity providers. You just need to choose two tokens and deposit them into the pool. For example, BURGER and BNB. After that, you will receive a BURGER token displaying your share in the pool. The number of BURGERs grows over time and can be redeemed anytime.  


### Central Bank

Central Bank is a single-asset double mining aggregator with which users can increase income from single-coin mining. At the time of writing, 4142371.58 USDT has already been locked in the protocol, while 5564562.99 USDT has been distributed among users. A wide selection of tokens is available to users. For example, the most profitable is BNB. By adding BNB to the protocol, users can earn up to 8.00% APY. The reward is paid in USDT stablecoin.  


### BurgerCities Lands

Currently, the BurgerCitites metaverse is still developing, and only key plot scenarios are available to users. In the future, the developers plan to introduce PVP and PVE gameplay. Trading is also available to users, within which they can swap tokens, in-game exchange resources, and trade NFTs.  


### Final Thoughts

BurgerCities is rapidly developing and entering into partnerships with notable projects. For example, DEGO Theater is available to game users in collaboration with DeFi + NFT DEGO protocol. The protocol creates a diversified product portfolio that includes liquidity mining, NFT auctions, NFT Minting, NFT trading, and more. BurgerCities has partnered with Treasureland, a cross-chain NFT platform with mining, trading, and other NFT-related services. In addition, StarryNift, a gaming platform and one-stop shop offering the creation, incubation, auction, and trade of NFT collectibles, has also settled in BurgerCities.¬†¬†

The concept of MetaFi is revolutionary and fascinating, so a project combining DeFi, NFTs, and the metaverse has a considerable chance of success. And given the vast number of partnerships with well-known companies, BurgerCities is probably one of the most potentially explosive projects in 2022.

What Is Dash? Dash Network Review || Educational,1,vzmjhq,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/vzmjhq/what_is_dash_dash_network_review_educational/,1,"[Dash Network ](https://www.dash.org/)([$DASH](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dash/)) is a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network and digital currency that provides you with fast, cheap payments worldwide. Its main goal is to offer you a user-friendly experience and privacy equal to cash.¬†

Transactions are made using the Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Service (PoS) consensus model, which is similar to Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).¬†

That was pivotal for the project to build a digital payments system with real use cases. That‚Äôs why you can shop with your $DASH at 150,000+ locations and online merchants for any goods you need.

The Dash Network has some undoubtful advantages:

1. One of the most private cryptocurrencies;
2. Speedy transactions;
3. Masternodes enable transaction anonymity;
4. High level of security.

https://preview.redd.it/qgwjhuulopb91.png?width=801&format=png&auto=webp&s=a176b713dc9cfa316ab4e70463918d4650bed494

### Dash History

Evan Duffield, a software developer, launched Dash on January 18, 2014, and named it XCoin, which was changed to Darkcoin later. In 2015, it was renamed Dash, reflecting its aim of being ""digital cash.""  


Dash has a two-level system of the network, and it's a unique innovation in the cryptocurrency world. That makes it possible to earn in the network both by mining digital currency but also on the masternodes. Masternodes are always online and have way more memory than usual nodes. They also process transactions for about several seconds. All this makes the network's capacity relatively high.  


### How Does Dash Works?

The most unique aspect of Dash is its masternodes system. A masternode is a special server with a full copy of the Dash blockchain. Users with at least 1,000 Dash can operate masternodes that power several of Dash's features.

These features include InstantSend, which allows for fully confirmed transactions within two seconds, and CoinJoin, a method of running a sequence of transactions and making them harder to trace. In exchange for running masternodes, users receive a portion of the block rewards from Dash mining.

While most merchants don't accept any type of cryptocurrency, Dash has had some success in this area. It launched DashDirect, a retail savings app, on July 27, 2021. The app allows you to make purchases using Dash in more than 155,000 stores and 125 websites. It also includes discounts, with the discount amount depending on the retailer.

One final thing worth noting is how user-friendly Dash is. Its website clearly explains how Dash works and where you can buy it. This may seem minor, but it stands out compared to all the cryptocurrencies with overly complicated websites.  


### Dash Ecosystem

One of the most prominent organizations in the Dash network is the Dash Core Group (DCG) which is building a platform where developers can create dApps and websites. The DCG platform will create a space for developers and businesses to improve their integration and payment solutions using Dash to reach decentralized finance and commerce.¬†

The DashDirect application is already used by about 155,000 retailers across the United States.

This proposal outlines a go-forward plan for the liquidity of StakeWise tokens in Uniswap pools via SWISE incentives. Deep liquidity will help to reduce slippage and bolster the sETH2 and rETH2 pegs, and liquidity mining incentives are a proven way to attract and retain LP liquidity.

https://www.polkadex.trade/ 

Polkadex with their native coin PDEX just made a major step by releasing their Orderbook public beta, soon to be followed by releasing it mainnet. Their last major milestone was securing a parachain slot on Polkadot

Polkadex combines the best aspects of centralized and decentralized exchanges while removing the worst aspects of both. 

-Non Custodial
-full orderbook trading
-fast and secure
-truly cross chain
-high frequency trading
-500,000 tps 
-low fees (unlike swaps)
-trading bot support
-asset delegation
-advanced limit orders

Plus so much more cutting edge stuff that all traders need. 

On top of all that their staking is at 36% APY currently. 

I truly think this will be the next big exchange since all the crypto you trade on here will be YOUR crypto, not technically the exchanges.

Go check it out, they just came out with a cool new video on their Twitter too, just cant post videos here so their Twitter is https://twitter.com/polkadex?t=PgIgteHqwSumAOYz1xkLew&s=09

Bullish on Slam Token,3,vsh3tq,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/vsh3tq/bullish_on_slam_token/,21,"Looking at the current value of the token, ~0.21 USD, the upside is tremendous for two reasons. 

1. There is only 10 million tokens in existence and 4.3 million are in the locked wallet for 100 years leaving the circulating supply at 5.7 million. 

2. Slam provides dividends from its casino and ecosystem to holders of 1,000+ Slam. That‚Äôs only $210 USD currently. Based on my napkin math from recent payouts, which occur every two weeks, the yearly return would be roughly 40% at current prices. So that would mean earning an additional $84 from a $210 investment. 

Slam is only growing. The licensed casino only launched earlier this year. There‚Äôs other gaming products in the pipeline.

That‚Äôs my 2 cents. 

To buy, it‚Äôs only available on PancakeSwap. When trading volume begins to increase it is planned to be listed on exchanges which the Slam developers are in contact with. This should provide a nice boost.

I have no affiliation with Slam Token.

According to C.1, SecretNetwork is a blockchain protocol built with Rust enabling decentralized applications to perform encrypted computations.¬†

Secret Network has its roots in another cryptocurrency project called Enigma. Enigma was founded in 2014 by MIT graduates Can Kisagun and Guy Zyskind.¬†

**Team**

Can Kisagun

Tor Bair

**$SCRT**

$SCRT is used to pay fees and transfer value on the network. Secret nodes must stake SCRT in order to operate on the network, and in return, they receive fees and network rewards in SCRT.

**About SecretNetwork**

Secret Network combines the best features of decentralized, open-source networks and blockchains with the benefits of data privacy and improved usability. These improvements are critical for achieving mass adoption.

Blockchains, and by extension smart contracts, have one glaring problem that is often overlooked ‚Äî all data stored on them is public. In that sense, blockchains are worse than anything that came before them when it comes to privacy. Instead of trusting your data with a single organization, you now have to trust everyone. Secret contracts and Secret Apps combine these benefits of dApps but add the ability to keep data private, helping remove one of the biggest barriers to mass adoption of the decentralized web

What's In Your Bag,17,vd7ley,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/vd7ley/whats_in_your_bag/,113,"AltCoin preferences all depend on how you see the world of crypto evolving. I used to only be into SOL (bought at $8, held at $250, still holding - I'm a long term investor; despite their recent growing pains, there's still massive adoption and I fully believe will get back with upcoming updates) but have branched out to diversify holdings with how I see the future being built in web3. What are some of your other AltCoins and what's their elevator pitch?

My others are XRP, Polkadot, and WeGro. 

XRP 
[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/xrp/]
There's no doubt in my mind a favorable decision is coming. Despite being in litigation with the SEC, it continues to trade heavily in outside exchanges and holds a steady T10 market cap. When the decision comes, I see an absolute explosion despite the current state of the market. 

Polkadot [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/polkadot-new/] 
DOT connects and secures specialized blockchains to facilitate cross-chain transfer of any data or asset type. This allows blockchains to be interoperable with one another to provide a foundation for web3. 

WeGro
[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/wegro-coin/]
WeGro is only 7 months old and setting itself up for BIG things. It's all about decentralized participation im the CAM industry (complimentary alternative medicine). But my biggest takeaway with them is their ability to create an ecosystem of privitizing your data to sell yourself to marketing companies. Instead of big companies selling your data, you take the power back and decide what to do with it. It's some eye-opening stuff at a ground level. Their 10 min video (https://youtu.be/I9AsmCUVBok) will widen your eyes at the future of data in web3. 

[Disclaimer - I'm a social moderator for WeGro as an independent contractor but this IS NOT an advertisement. I actually believe like hell in this AltCoin and am far off from being a MoonBoi]",2022-06-15 18:18:29,1655335109.0

World Mobile Token (WMT) - paving the way to mass adoption,9,vakorl,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/vakorl/world_mobile_token_wmt_paving_the_way_to_mass/,6,"It‚Äôs been a while since I wrote a DD on World Mobile Token (WMT) but so much has happened that I think it‚Äôs worth updating my previous post with the latest developments. I‚Äôll be using a fair bit of info from my one of my previous posts as I want to make sure everything is covered.
¬† 

The TLDR of WMT¬†is that they‚Äôre a Telecommunications company first and foremost. What separates them from the other 1000 Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) is that they are combining Cardano's blockchain technology as well as the Sharing Economy business model (think Uber and Airbnb).¬† Their mission is to connect the unconnected and finally bridge the digital divide the separates the haves from the have-nots. The poor get poorer because they don‚Äôt have the same privileges that the wealthy do. Internet access will level the playing field as things we take for granted such as education, healthcare and financial services is just a click away.¬†Let that sink in for a bit before you read on. This is an incredibly important project that, if they succeed, will immediately be beneficial to any other crypto project you‚Äôre invested in as the other half of the global population will finally have access to crypto.

‚Ä¢ 1000 Mobile Network Operators (MNO) providing internet access to 52% of the world. 

‚Ä¢ $2.6 trillion global telecommunications industry 

‚Ä¢ 3.7B people (48%) without internet access 

‚Ä¢ Therefore circa $2.6 trillion left on the table (or under a mattress)

‚Ä¢ 54% have mobile phones

Market Cap of World Mobile VS other Mobile Network Operators


‚Ä¢ World Mobile USD$70 million 

‚Ä¢ Vodafone USD$50 BILLION 

‚Ä¢ Singtel/Optus USD$40B 

‚Ä¢ Telstra USD$31B


Take this comparison with a grain of salt as it‚Äôs hard to compare MC of traditional stocks vs crypto. But still, the upside is apparent.

Sharing economy


I didn't quite understand this term until someone pointed out other examples such as Uber and AirBnB, who both use the Sharing Economy business model. With this in mind, it makes sense how World Mobile will be able to keep costs low (approximately 12 times cheaper than legacy MNOs) when other MNOs have failed to do the same. Because basically, the infrastructure is built and maintained by the customer. Other MNOs have to invest capital into costly towers, and then have their tiny profit margins eaten into when something goes wrong and they need to pay an expensive engineer to drive a few days through unpaved terrain, pay for food and accommodation. The World Mobile customer, who earns revenue from their Air Node, takes care of all of this, including making sure no one steals, vandalises or damages the equipment.


..............................................................................................................


Confirmed Partnerships



Cardano - Cardano is a top 5 coin in terms of Market Cap size (not counting stablecoings) but the what sets them apart from the other Layer 1s is that their blockchain is peer reviewed (90+ papers) and mathematically proven to work. Charles Hoskinson, Founder of Cardano, has been heavily criticised for how long it has taken to get Cardano to where it is today when other Blockchains have passed them by (albeit with expensive consequences, see Terra Luna). But his reasoning is akin to building an Airplane. If people are going to put their lives/livelihoods into his creation, he is going to make sure there are no issues with it. The fact that a company like Cardano/IOHK have not only partnered with World Mobile, but also have a 10% equity stake in World Mobile (IOHK have no stake in any other Cardano Project) speaks volumes about how critical World Mobile‚Äôs success will be to their own mission in Banking the Unbanked, which you can‚Äôt do until you Connect the Unconnected. In the crypto world, Cardano's name is comparable to Google, Amazon or Tesla.
Here's some link for easy reference if you wanted to read further.


Fulham FC ‚Äì Fulham won the 2022 Champions League and will therefore be promoted to the English Premier League next season. This is a 3 year partnership. This is NOT a sponsorship deal where World Mobile simply paid huge sums of money to have their logo on the front of Fulham jerseys. The partnership runs deeper. How? Good question, I never asked. Someone find out please!
¬† 

EPSON ‚Äì That‚Äôs right. The $6.6 billion Printer company partnered with WM in November 2021 to support education and bring new opportunities to the unconnected schools in Africa, where WM provided internet connectivity and EPSON supplied the printers and projectors. Not exactly a price catalyst but a solid boost in credibility nonetheless.
¬†

Unconfirmed Partnerships
¬† 

Starlink, Microsoft and Google ‚Äì Starlink has been heavily ‚Äúhinted at‚Äù by the founders (several pics of founders visiting SpaceX invite-only restricted areas). My guess is a partnership is there so that Starlink can act as a backhaul option but has yet to be formally announced due to legal reasons. However, all three have been named in their ‚ÄúPartnerships, Collaborations, Vendor & Supply Chain Team‚Äù list¬†https://worldmobile.io/blog/post/deployment-diary/
¬† 

Let‚Äôs pause for a moment and imagine Elon tweeting a pic of 
himself wearing a Fulham FC Jersey with the WM logo on full display.
¬† 

..............................................................................................................


Physical Assets
¬†


This is what separates World Mobile Token from every other crypto project. Ok I take that back. Everything I wrote above separates WMT from everything. But the physical, tangible assets that World Mobile have deployed on the ground (and in the air) is clear proof to skeptics that WMT is not magic internet money like some see crypto to be. They have a blimp for f*cks sake! A BLIMP! It‚Äôs technically an Aerostat, but whatever you want to call it, it‚Äôs a big-ass balloon 300 metres up in the sky with WORLD MOBILE printed on the side, holding hundreds of kilograms worth of equipment that will provide internet access to everyone underneath within a 70km radius. There are several benefits of having (unmanned) Aerostats instead of Cell-phone towers but cost is a huge factor. Just two of these bad boys and Zanzibar will be covered (first one goes up end of July 2022), and around 100 of them will cover unconnected areas of Tanzania. 

¬† 

Other assets include: 

‚Ä¢ Air Nodes - imagine a pole with a couple of solar powered panels, a light on top, a couple of batteries at the bottom, and a big ass modem/router in the middle as one example (there will be many iterations). Air Nodes will provide high speed internet to everyone within a 100m ‚Äì 200m radius, as well as electricity thanks to the solar power panels and batteries. Click here to see what happened to this tiny fishing village that previously had no electricity, light, or internet:¬†https://youtu.be/hYlLA9emiaw. Under the Sharing Economy business model, Air Nodes will be owned and operated by the local community. My basic understanding is that, if I lived in the middle of nowhere, with no electricity and internet, we would simply download the hardware (off the shelf) specs off World Mobile website, followed the instructions provided on putting everything together and setting it up, I would eventually be connected to the internet and anyone around me would also be able to connect using my Air Node (after they paid for a pre-paid data pack from the nearest shop using local fiat). Once they connected to my Air Node, I would earn revenue depending on how many people were connected. And at twice the speeds of competitors as well as half the price, I can‚Äôt imagine people not connecting if given the option. 

¬† 

‚Ä¢ Earth Nodes ‚Äì there will be a maximum of 1000 of these. Most of them have been reserved but the final 100 or so are being auctioned off. About 15 have already been sold at the time of writing. First year ROI is set to be at least 50% / 50,000 WMT from inflation rewards alone. The bigger draw to own and operate an earth node is that Earth Node Operators (ENOs) will earn a percentage of revenue from users/subcribers. An Earth Node is basically a computer that validates transactions on the block chain. That‚Äôs crypto speak for an automated Finance / Book-keeping team processing the paperwork (possibly a terrible analogy but I‚Äôm dumbing it down as much as I can because‚Ä¶ well, I‚Äôm dumb myself and that‚Äôs how I understand it). The way ENOs get paid is also what makes it easy for me to say WMT is not a Ponzi/Pyramid scheme. With a lot of sh*tcoins, investors make money when other investors buy in after them. But with WMT the process is like this: 

1.¬†Local internet user pays cash for data card and use WM internet service 

2.¬†Cash goes into WM treasury 

3.¬†WM Treasury uses the cash to buy WMT on market / exchanges 

4.¬†WM distributes WM Token to ENOs 

5.¬†Profit 

¬† 

This process drives the price up organically, not from investors investing. But from people purchasing internet data packages. Of course, price will also be driven up by investors but it‚Äôs not necessary like other crypto projects.

Magus Nodes \[$MAGUS\]. Our team consists of veterans in the crypto space, who have come together to bring the Node community one of the biggest and most sustainable projects of the year.

We will be developing and launching one of the first P2P Node marketplaces in the space, with goals to become multichain!

Website: [https://www.magusnodes.com/](https://www.magusnodes.com/)

Magus Nodes long-term plan is to introduce new products to the ecosystem to attract users from all over.

Daily 1% ROI Earn $MAGUS tokens every day with your nodes! Each node costs 100 MAGUS tokens to create, and there is a limited supply of 100k nodes. Once they're gone, you'll have to purchase off the secondary market!

Our biggest hurdle was achieving sustainability. By introducing a fantastic token recycle mechanism and a community treasury, we have set up Magus to last long-term. NFT BOOSTERS P2P MARKETPLACE The Marketplace will provide a way for you to safely make transactions with your tokenized assets.

This allows you to sell items you have collected, as well as buy assets that you need. You will be able to earn NFT rewards and then resell them and convert your proceeds into fiat money.

Total Supply: 10,000,000 $MAGUS

Node Total Supply: 100,000

Transactions Fees: Buy Tax: 1% / Sell Tax: 1%

Node Claim fee: 10% (8% rewards pool 1/1 to development and treasury) (Sell tax is currently at 16% and drops 2% daily until we go to 1%)

It involves sending/transfer of an e-money value to a registered phone-number(mssidn) via USSD code. when that e-value is sent, the sender can contact the receiver via text(sms) to inquire whether he or she have received the amount in question.

In simplicitic terms, you are able to achieve the transfer of the funds but also maintain communication between the parties concerned,

Wit that background, I will proceed with elaborating what my query is all about.

Say I have an online store that accepts bitcoins and want people(my clients) to be able to contact me through the same wallet they used to send the bitcoins.

Can that be done and how??

Something that not only allows anonymous transactions take place directly between two entities but also may involve exchanging messages, order ids, refund addresses, and something that results in a negotiated transaction which can be broadcast on the P2P network just like the bitcoin Network.

If I could send a message to a wallet, I would know for a fact that the person reading is the one that has access to whatever funds I send to that wallet. Using the sender and destination's public keys to allow the exchange of both bitcoins and text messages",2024-11-18 06:03:53,1731931433.0

I've started transferring my bitcoin from my wallet to Kraken over the last few days so I can start selling it off bit by bit as the price rises. My first few transfers cost me around ‚Ç¨1 to ‚Ç¨2 each (~0.0000232 BTC each), but when I went to transfer some more today, I was getting quoted ‚Ç¨30 (~0.00037 BTC). The mempool suggests that the fees right now are around $0.60, so I don't understand why I'm being quoted such a high fee. 

Have I screwed myself by not consolidating my UTXOs? I was tangentially aware of the concept of UTXOs but wasn't really in the detail with them, which I think may have cost me. I've now looked at consolidating them but I'm being quoted ‚Ç¨87 (0.00101 BTC) to do that. 

Is my assumption correct that it's UTXOs? Is this simply an expensive lesson for me to learn? Is it worth consolidating them now anyway? Any thoughts are more than welcome.

Hope I won't be crucifixed for my question but I will try anyway!

Most of the time, I have read comments on here saying that Bitcoin is still the crypto to invest in, because it's solid, it's stable and has still prospects of growing.

Now with the Bitcoin reaching its ATH , how much would you think someone should invest in BTC to make it worth.

Of course depends on how much money someone is ready to ""loose"" and I understand that but in real terms, you people how many Bitcoins have? In particular those who invested in the last 2-3 years, how many BTC you have in your wallet currently?

In my specific case, to give some context:
I am a doctor in UK, so my salary is decent but nothing more than that. I have a lump of money I would be happy to invest in crypto, but this won't be more than ¬£15-20k?
With this amount of funds, would you say it's still worth to buy like 1/4 of BTC or at this stage doesn't make sense anymore?

I am sorry if this question sounds stupid or has been already asked several times, I still hope you could give me your feedback about.

As I said, I understand the amount of money to invest depends only in how much I feel confident to loose ¬£15-20k and never see them again üôÇ

So, i got an account on Kraken and did a try upload of 10 dollars to my account. It is in my account

I bought the Jaden cold wallet and safely wrote down only on paper my 12 recovery words and set the pin.

I installed the Blockstream GREEN app on my android. Linked it to my Jaden wallet. Send a tiny amount of bitcoin to Blockstream (From BTCDirect. Not Kraken as i started to with BTC Direct to buy a little part of a coin first) Just created Kraken account.

So now i think i am ready to SAFELY start investing. What i want to do is:

1. Buy Bitcoin (Say, 50 euro first as a test then batches of 10.000 euro) by sending euro's to my Kraken account
2. Buy the Bitcoin on Kraken with the deposit i just did (There is no limit right?)
3. SEND the bitcoin from Kraken to my Blockstream. I choose to send Bitcoin to the account adress (Long BC1 code) of my Blockstream app.

Hmm. Then i have it on the blockstream app. I guess i need to connect with BluTooth for it so it is savely stored in the Jade app

Not to sure on that last step yet. How it does from the blockstream app to the physical Jaden device

And then by Bitcoins are save? There in my cold wallet. 12 key password is savely stored away. Then i can put it in a locker and don't think about it for a few years.

Phew. I have faith in Bitcoin. But i must admit it's quite daunting. Expecially since a stupid mistake can cost me a LOT of money

" After 15 Years, Is Bitcoin Closer to Real-World Adoption or Still Just Speculation? ",2,1gowyp9,BitcoinBeginners,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/1gowyp9/after_15_years_is_bitcoin_closer_to_realworld/,44,"I've been following Bitcoin for a while, and as we‚Äôre now 15 years out from its creation, I'm curious about where it truly stands in terms of mainstream adoption. When Bitcoin was launched in 2009, there was this huge vision of it becoming a new kind of money‚Äîdecentralized and used in everyday life. But in 2024, it‚Äôs still not widely used in daily transactions, whether it‚Äôs for groceries, utilities, or other routine purchases.  

I‚Äôm trying to understand what factors might be holding back its wider adoption for practical, day-to-day use. For example, if we look at the evolution of technologies like smartphones, they were clunky at first, but within 10-15 years, they became essential in most people‚Äôs lives. Bitcoin, on the other hand, seems mostly used as a speculative asset rather than an everyday currency.  

Do you think Bitcoin‚Äôs role will remain focused on store of value and investment, or is there still a path to real-world, transactional use? And how do proponents of Bitcoin address the critiques that it could resemble speculative bubbles, particularly when its value is so heavily market-driven?  

I almost invested in Bitcoin earlier this year as it hovered around $15K, considering it as a high-risk, high-reward asset. Ultimately, I held off because I wasn‚Äôt convinced it had crossed that threshold into being anything more than a long-term speculative play. I‚Äôm genuinely curious if there are concrete developments that could lead to more day-to-day utility in the near future or if Bitcoin‚Äôs primary value will always be in its scarcity and decentralized nature rather than its practical use.

LAST  is a link to a pertinent screen shot .

And now i have peak anxiety. First thing i think of is unplugging my google next hub, my Sonos boxes wich support speach and generally hide in a supply closet where no 'smart devices' can hear me. But my phone does....

I think EVEN if i disable all my speach support Google is an asshole and listens anyway. Just like it doesnt 'share' my whereabouts'. Or one of my apps had a secret backdoor.

I intent to eventually invest 50.000 euro or more in bitcoin. So yes the thought of someone stealing them worries me. I am thinking of buying a Ledger Nano S Plus. To keep them offline.

I found an old core wallet and I suspect that there might be a small amount of money in there. I can't download the whole blockchain again. It takes forever, crashes too often and is just unreliable.

COLDCARD Cannot Recognize PSBT and Other Issues?,1,1gmko8o,BitcoinBeginners,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/1gmko8o/coldcard_cannot_recognize_psbt_and_other_issues/,14,"Hello all,

I want to preface this by saying I got really into Bitcoin during COVID. I bought a hardware wallet (COLDCARD Mk4) at some point and set it up and then imported to Bluewallet to watch my balance.

I'm trying to be a little more serious about it now after life got in the way and I'm testing the wallet to make sure I can move my funds for when I need them. I withdrew some sats from Swan where I had some bitcoin to withdraw using the xpub from my COLDCARD and it never showed up in Bluewallet. First red flag.

Then, I tried sending some funds from the wallet to test it and after creating the PSBT, the COLDCARD cannot validate it and I get this error: ""Failure: Missing redeem/witness script for output #1""

I did a little digging but came up empty. I also tried re-importing the wallet according to Bluewallet's instructions and it created another COLDCARD import, but the public keys on the new wallet start with bc and the public keys on the existing wallet start with 3.

I'm really trying to make sure I have access to all of my funds. I'm wanting to eventually use it for our wedding and I'm frankly feeling a little unnerved right now that my funds are locked up with no way for me to use them.

Any help would be greatly appreciated since I don't have the technical knowledge or time to be able to work this out. I think keeping my own keys requires me to better understand everything before moving any more funds.",2024-11-08 09:08:01,1731078481.0

Not only hackers, but also burglaries. Someone might home invade you for your private keys after learning from a broadcasted transaction (from your IP address) that you are sitting on a fat stack.

With this in mind, the Sparrow guide recommends running an Electerum server from your own node. However, isn't this still standing out to attackers? If an attacker sees someone drop $200+ on setting up a personal Bitcoin node, they've probably got a fair bit of bitcoin to justify the expense.

But if you're not necessarily too concerned about privacy and all you want are lower fees wouldn't it make more sense to keep all the bitcoins in the same address? As once you want to liquidate that you will have to transfer those bitcoins to a potential buyer and if you're doing so all the bitcoins from one address instead of Bitcoin spread out across various addresses you would presumably pay less in transaction fees.

I‚Äôm new to the world of Bitcoin and find its decentralized structure absolutely fascinating ‚Äì a monetary system that operates without central control! What really stands out to me is how Bitcoin combines the best qualities of gold (limited supply) and paper money (easy to transfer). But one thing that worries me is Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility, which has been so high in the past.

What if this volatility isn‚Äôt just a temporary phenomenon, but a permanent characteristic? A highly fluctuating price could make Bitcoin impractical as a payment method since prices would constantly need to adjust. And as a store of value, it would only be partially reliable. The decentralization alone doesn‚Äôt seem enough to justify its value ‚Äì what‚Äôs the point of decentralized money if it‚Äôs difficult to use for trade or as a stable store of wealth?

A ponzi scheme is not based on any type of value, only a greater fool situation which is just a lack of information. Clearly, BTC has some type of inherent value, since it can be used as a medium of exchange and is compared to digital gold, so the value is greater than 0. 

Now, the supply of bitcoin is decreasing over time as a result of a cap upon the total number of bitcoins in existence and lost wallets, so if the value BTC provides remains constant, the price should increase over time just for this reason. 

If BTC can't be replaced by another cryptocurrency, then it has the properties of stable inherent value that is greater than 0 and a decreasing supply, putting pressure on the price to go up indefinetly and leading to basically an infinte money glitch within the current inflationary fiat monetary system.

Now, the main thing which is unclear to me: What prevents someone from making a new cryptocurrency with slightly more inherent value than BTC? BTC has kind of a moat due to the network effect, but surely if someone invented a crypto with more inherently value that does what BTC does but better, maybe in terms of power consumption or network capacity, BTC would eventually get replaced, right?

If you ignore that, would this even be enough money to invest in it to make a difference since its a small fraction of its current value?

Question about BTC value.,1,1gcxssb,BitcoinBeginners,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/1gcxssb/question_about_btc_value/,18,"When we spend BTC for any goods. The value of the goods is based on fiat currency rather than the portion of BTC. (The amount of BTC you pay for something is based on what that would be in fiat currency).

Therefore, does BTC matter at all? For example, if when you pay with BTC the amount of BTC you are requested to spend to the other individual is based solely on what the portion equates to in fiat currency...

Additionally, does this mean that BTC can only have its value in and of itself if it was completely separate from fiat currency in that it does not have any value as in it is worth $0... because if it is worth $2 and you want to purchase a packet of crisps... then you would pay 2 BTC because that's what it is in dollars?

TL;DR, If BTC does not break away from being valued by fiat currency then when spending BTC for goods *if it became a widely recognised currency* not matter as it is linked to fiat currency and it has no value itself?",2024-10-26 18:26:04,1729985164.0

Need help with Sparrow Wallet error,5,1g4xwiw,BitcoinBeginners,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/1g4xwiw/need_help_with_sparrow_wallet_error/,6,"Hello, fellow Bitcoin people

Well this might not be quite the right sub for this, but Sparrow has no sub, and no forum on their website. I figured someone on here might have run into the same issue.

I am having an issue when trying to scan for my hardware wallet (Blockstream Jade) in Sparrow. I had set up my Jade in Sparrow a few months ago, and everything worked just fine. I simply just connected the Jade through USB and scanned for it in Sparrow, and it popped right up.

Well yesterday I did a factory reset on my Jade because I wanted to update the firmware. I plugged the Jade in and was going to scan for it in Sparrow, however Sparrow is not having an issue giving me the following error when clicking the button to scan for hardware wallets: ""Error executing HWI"".

I searched the internet, and found multiple online posts with people having the same issue, and some of them were from a few years ago, so I don't understand why this error still persists.

I am running Sparrow on Fedora Linux. Here is the error shown in my sparrow.log:

KYC or not [?],5,1g4asqn,BitcoinBeginners,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/1g4asqn/kyc_or_not/,17,"I came across the following dilemma:

1. ""If you are poor or low-income and are in Brazil, you will probably not only keep Bitcoin as a hedge (protection of assets) but you will also probably buy something as Bitcoin appreciates. In this case, they recommend that you buy with KYC at a brokerage so that you can declare it and, when you buy something more expensive, the rotten state will know where the money came from.""
2. ""If you are already rich and will use Bitcoin ONLY as protection of assets, there is no problem in buying with non-KYC - it is even recommended, of course.""

However, I feel extremely disgusted with myself for even considering contributing to the oppressive state by declaring Income Tax (Income Tax is a federal tax levied each year on the earnings of an individual or legal entity.). That is why I came across the concept of ""The Bandit's Wallet"", which seems to me to be the best thing to do.

From my understanding, ""The Bandit's Wallet"" is about you having a small amount of BTC in an institution that is KYC (like Bipa), but in reality the rest of your Satoshi are completely anonymous in the model without KYC.

I asked to AI and told me that there is a process that has some steps. **But I have some questions...**

1. **Anyone can propose changes:** Individuals or groups can submit proposals for new features or improvements to the Bitcoin Core codebase. These proposals are often documented in Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs).
   * **Where are these proposals registered? Do they have to be in a specific format? Who receives them and controls the website where they are uploaded?**
2. **Peer review and testing:** Other developers in the community review the proposed changes, ensuring they align with Bitcoin's principles and are technically sound. Extensive testing is conducted to identify and address potential issues.
   * **Who are these developers? How many are there? I understand that they are not paid or working full time, so how do you make sure that there are no bad developers or proposals that are intended to cause potential harm? Where is testing done? Does Bitcoin have any kind of QA environment? If the code is open and anyone can contribute, what prevents someone from proposing senseless changes trolling?**
3. **Consensus:** If a proposal gains sufficient support from the community, it can be merged into the main Bitcoin Core codebase.
   * **How is community support measured? Who approves that the change is okay and certifies that it is good? Is there some kind of vote? Who decides? Who performs the merging of the new code into the Bitcoin codebase? Who controls the repository where it is stored? I understand that it is publicly accessible and is on GitHub, who presses the button to deploy a new change to the source code? Who has control of the repository to grant or withdraw permissions?**
4. **Implementation:** Once merged, developers can update their Bitcoin nodes to incorporate the new changes.
   * **What happens to nodes in the network that don't update to the new version? I understand that a ""fork"" can be formed in case of important updates, but in that case, everyone would have to update uniformly always, how do they agree to decide which change is good and which is not? Could a group of nodes organize a kind of ""protest"" if they don't like an update? What happens if the person who manages a node is busy or is not aware and therefore does not update? So all nodes are super informed of all updates day by day? How many nodes are there? I understand that there are several types of nodes, do they all need to update? If a node forgot to update and does it after days or weeks, what happens?**

If you read everything I appreciate it, I know they might seem like silly questions, but I've been checking and I can't find much information about the details of how this whole process works, people just blindly assume that the mechanism has no room for failure and that bitcoin is totally decentralized... but if the changes and revisions are only proposed and approved by a small group of people (developers), which we don't know, I even understand that some are part of a ""Bitcoin Core"" organization or are owners of websites like Blockchain dot com (I'm not sure if that's the company). Really all the people who have bitcoin are subject to their decisions, and to how the repository of changes is managed. Lastly, the nodes could also disagree on several things, because ultimately they are managed by people, and getting consensus for changes in large groups is complicated. I imagine there is an explanation for all this, I would appreciate if someone knowledgeable about the subject could answer it, thanks!

**TLDR: I describe the steps of the process of including improvements and updates in the Bitcoin source code and raise some questions (highlighted in bold) for which I have not found many answers and which everyone simply accepts with their eyes closed without many understanding how it works.**",2024-10-10 00:07:18,1728536838.0

Bitcoin data extraction and analysis,2,1g05lcp,BitcoinBeginners,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/1g05lcp/bitcoin_data_extraction_and_analysis/,2,"I‚Äôm trying to find the BTC wallets that have completed between 5 and 20 transactions in the last 3 months. For each wallet meeting this criterion, I want to find/fetch details of the wallet address, date/time of the transactions, and transaction information i.e. BTC amount, price, purchase or sale. The deliverable should be an Excel file capturing this information.

I am aware of two approaches to this problem. The first using prebuilt APIs which will return a specific, filtered dataset. The second approach using AWS infrastructure services to access, process, and query blockchain data without needing the third-party APIs.

I ruled out the API-based approach because it offers limited flexibility (can‚Äôt fully customize the dataset to meet all the requirements) and is also expensive.

So I went with the second one but while querying, I got stuck because of export failing due to the large data set. The data set is large since the query returned over 15 million rows (entries) because of duplication. A wallet which has completed say 18 transactions (meets criterion/falls within the 5 and 20 txs range) appears 18 times in the dataset. As a result of each transaction from the qualifying wallets being counted as a separate row, the query returned over 15 million entries.

How can I go about this or is there another approach that would be more suited to the problem?

Am I right in thinking, now it's showing in trezor suite, it is 100% safe? barring obviously a wrench attack or someone getting my seed phrase - both of which is kinda on me for being careless. 

On the bluewallet transaction, I did click 'send' a few minutes before clicking 'confirm' on the trezor, but I had visually checked the address that had been generated 3-4 times first. As mentioned, both transactions are showing in the suite. More haste less speed.

Ive never really considered the possibility of getting into BTC, since once I was old enough for it to matter, they were thousands of dollars for a single one (and I stupidly thought you could only buy in wholes at a time). I've since learned you can buy them in extremely small amounts and just save up over time, and that's what interests me.

Firstly, I read through the FAQ on this page, and immediately got questions. It says before you invest ""Pay off any high interest debt and have an emergency savings fund"". Why is that? If I were only buying like $20 worth every week or two, why would I need to pay off any and all debts or have savings?

Second, I've looked into the difference between hot and cold wallets, but are hot wallets even worth using, even short term? With how prominent hackers have been lately, it seems like it would only be worth getting into BTC if I have a cold wallet on standby, but maybe I'm misunderstanding?

Now, a month and a half later, they're asking me to resubmit an appeal.

Has anyone experienced the same? Did you solve it, and if so how?

This sounds like gambling and I'm not in to gamble hard. 

I bought in when it was 30k, bought more when it dipped at 16k I think, so he thinks it's a good move that I sell 1/3 of what I have now, keep the fiat aside for when it turns bearish, then buy again.

Blockstream Jade Multisig with one device,2,1fjn3i7,BitcoinBeginners,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/1fjn3i7/blockstream_jade_multisig_with_one_device/,9,"Semi-beginner here.

Just got my Blockstream Jade a few weeks ago. Been playing around with and getting familiar with it until I'm confident. Kinda curious with multisig though, but didn't want to shell out (at least this early) for another hardware wallet or two.

From what I can tell, I can set up a (2 out of 3) multisig with just one Jade device by:

1. Generating 3x 12/24 word recovery keys and writing them down
2. Draw the Seed QR for each keys that Jade generates
3. Create a multisig wallet in Sparrow
4. Import keystores from those three separate recovery keys by scanning the Seed QR (fastest) or manually inputting the recovery keys each time (painfully slow). Can skip one key if you store one of three keys in the Jade.

I created a test multisig wallet in Sparrow but I haven't put test amounts in it yet though.

My question is... is this recommended at all?

From what I can tell, it's harder to backup/hide the QR codes since you shouldn't print them for obvious reasons, have to keep them far away from any cameras that's not the Jade, and it's kinda hard to make steel/titanium backups for them. Even if one doesn't use the Seed QRs, inputting one to three recovery seeds (basically 12-36 words, if using 12-words each) is a pain.

Would save me a couple of bucks from buying another hardware wallet, and maybe spend that in one of those steel/titanium backup plates instead, hmm...

At least it's an option I guess, especially if one doesn't plan on moving their Bitcoin frequently.

On the other hand, all this hassle when an extra long passphrase for singlesig might suffice?",2024-09-18 02:25:28,1726644328.0

Bitwarden vs Proton vs KeePassBitwarden vs Proton vs KeePass ,5,1fi7xz8,BitcoinBeginners,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/1fi7xz8/bitwarden_vs_proton_vs_keepassbitwarden_vs_proton/,12,"I am thinking of moving my passwords from keepass which has been pretty good so far to something like bitwarden which is more popular with crypto enthusiasts or with proton because they also have protonmail which looks cool and like to separate my emails and spam.

I like keepass because its offline. I looked at proton which allows you to make separate emails and passwords for each site you make an account on. I could do that with keepass but I like the intuitiveness of proton. The main reason to get a password manager is to secure passwords but what if proton or bitwarden get infiltrated or something. Should I stick with keepass or move on and to which password manager given I would pay for the premium for it too.

I would also like to hear what people have to say in terms of managing their passwords, emails, accounts with different sites and services like banks, work related stuff, personal, shopping, games...

also is it safe to copy and paste passwords or use autofills or to type it out.

If you guys or vets in the game be able to share how you secure your passwords, emails as well as into their own sections like personal shopping, personal hobbies, work, bank, crypto etc that'd be great. What kind of storage safe do you personally use to keep emergency password sheets, hardware wallet and whether to take it with you when traveling to work etc. Your own anecdotal instructions and experience is beneficial. as well as password bit and characters. Is 32 characters and just under 200 bits too much? and if not then should i use this method for all passwords from website shopping or online games where I dont buy things and not just exclusively for crypto stuff?

Edit:

So I am thinking of going with BitWarden but in terms of managing my emails, does bitwarden have such a thing like protonmail and if not should i stick with managing emails and passwords separately on bitwarden or exclusively use emails using protonmail. I also feel like it is more secure if i move away from gmail.

I assume I'd have to specify the fee with ""Custom"" because the ""Recommended"" one says ""Warning: Fee estimation is currently not possible.""

Can I safely generate a Receiving address with the new wallet using Bech32/SegWit to keep fees low for this transaction from the migrated legacy wallet, or do I need to use Base58/P2SH-SegWit?

Cost to overthrow bitcoin network 2024?,0,1fcpxpe,BitcoinBeginners,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/1fcpxpe/cost_to_overthrow_bitcoin_network_2024/,25,"Hi guys, I asked this to chat gpt just out of curiousity so I can better understand the incentives of bitcoin. Chat gpt said for a 51% attack, it would cost several billion USD based on the computational power at the current time +  the hardware & electricity required to implement the attack.

So at this time obvi, people are more incentivized to buy bitcoin than to overthrow the network, however, I'm thinking about high net worth individuals, let's say bezos for an example who has 170bn in assets. Let's say he can singlehandedly go through all the work of aqcuiring miners, and energy to overthrow the bitcoin network of ""several billion"" like 7bn in electricity and hardware. Let's say it costs him roughly 20 billion. Wouldn't he be able to do it? Not only that, wouldn't he in a way be incentivized to do so given he owns a ton of the capital in USD. Also, that's just one billionaire, there are multiple who together can front the cost of overthrowing the bitcoin network by putting a little fund together.

Thoughts? Is chat gpt wrong in it's estimates? Am I incorrect in the incentives?",2024-09-09 08:51:54,1725889914.0

- Paper wallet

Paper wallet is an option. But again, at some point I will have access to the private key.  
Opendime is fine, but too geeky. And my friends can't check the balance on the go.

I have read a number of posts not only here but in other subs as well and still a bit confused.

If there is one thing that stuck in my head is ""Not your keys not your coins"" that I learned.

I am a total beginner when it comes to cryptocurrency and I do not own any - where are my questions;

Correct and if Im wrong and please advise;

I can buy crypto vi Exchange (coinbase, kraken etc) or P2P (bisq, robosats etc) My understanding based on posts here and other subs is that its easy to use an exchange. P2P is a way to buy without KYC which dont care if the government knows im buying coins also seems to be the consensus to be more expensive than buying using a exchange.

* I have been reading a lot of bad reviews about coinbase though. People getting locked out of their accounts as well as customer service. Are there any exchanges provide a ""decent"" service? 
* When I buy the coin, does it sit at coinbase - do I HAVE to use a different ""service"" as a wallet then?

A lot of my reading, I have also seen a lot of people scared of losing their coins after purchasing with an exchange and MUST move outside of there?

* Also a lot of discussions around hot/cold wallets. From what I learned it seems that cold wallets are more secure and I came across wallet caller Trezor (they are pricey). So lets say I buy crypto from Coinbase, should I then move to my cold wallet trezor? Lets then say I decide to sell, do I simple move my coins from the hardware wallet to the coinbase using some type of software?
* Personally I would prefer to use some type of software for wallet, but seems to be not secure enough. What hardware wallet besides trezor are you using?

I plan on buying small quantities, like $100/$200 often, my general goal is to keep for long periods of time looking for asset appreciation. 

 I started creting an account with coinbase but stopped half way because of all the bad posts around it. So looking for some general guidance of this community.

I noticed that in the ""ian coleman"" tool, it generates addresses in the ""BIP 44"" format (and also in other formats), and in the electrum wallet, the addresses always appear in the ""BIP 84"" format.



My question is: If I, for example, provide an address in the ""BIP 44"" format to receive a transfer, would it be visible in my electrum wallet? Or should I always provide addresses in the BIP 84 format when using electrum?",2024-09-01 18:43:39,1725234219.0

Found This online, an old article dated from 2022:

OUR PERSPECTIVE AND ASSESSMENT

Both MiCA and TFR should take effect in January 2023. However, we have 18 months time to implement them fully. This means that until June 2024, nothing is changing immediately for Relai users. As always, we want to be completely transparent here: There is no way for us as a company to circumvent this regulation. This means that in the future, we will have to comply with any EU regulations that directly affect us.

The short-term perspective (2 years):
For now, our service can continue as is. Meaning that for you as a user, nothing changes. The only thing we are monitoring is that the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) could lower limits for Non-KYC buys to 1k CHF per month and 12k CHF per year.

So non-KYC purchases can still be offered. If you want to use KYC to eg. raise your limits, you can already do that anytime in the Relai app.

The long-term perspective (+2 years):
In January 2024, we plan to start a transition period to shut down Non-KYC buys slowly. The reality is that we must comply with the regulation, and therefore, there is no way around that.

Starting in June 2024, the new EU regulation (MiCA) will be based on the nationality of the customer and no longer on the location of the company, similar to the GDPR legislation.

Had they been lying in wait since inception of the wallet in 2020, they took a huge gamble and could have stolen a lot more -- it seems unlikely.

EDIT 2: Does anyone know how to check the existing firmware on my wallet? (any way to check past firmware). I've always confirmed keys on device when updating firmware, but I want to check. I still have no clear understanding of what happened.",2024-08-26 11:00:14,1724688014.0
How can I verify a BTC wallet by sending and receiving from the same address?,2,1f1k5gh,BitcoinBeginners,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/1f1k5gh/how_can_i_verify_a_btc_wallet_by_sending_and/,9,"Hello, long story shot but Gemini is requiring that I ""verify"" a BTC to allow me to move my BTC off of their exchange.

Their instructions say that I need to send $1 or less of BTC from an address which will be the same address that will be verified and whitelisted.

I haven't used a BTC wallet in a long time but just got access to my frozen Gemini account and now transferring out the $200 or so of BTC I have in there.

I checked on here to see what BTC wallet people were recommended. I downloaded Blockstream Green. Created wallet. OK.. but it's showing it will create a new wallet address everytime you receive or send? Maybe I understand that incorrectly? Does it create a new BTC address everytime you receive or send? If so, how can I verify this new address with Gemini? Since my BTC address needs to remain the same for both sending (to Gemini) a receiving later (from Gemini) in order to ""verify"" my wallet address.

Q coldcard issue,1,1f1bjpo,BitcoinBeginners,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/1f1bjpo/q_coldcard_issue/,4,"Hi everyone. 

When signing an air gappeed transaction on Sparrow, the QR code on the Q screen is super tiny and my laptop camera does not read it. I tried for 2 consecutive days unsuccessfully (changing camera settings, brightness, resolution, etc). 

The solution I came up with was taking a picture of the  coldcard screen (tiny QR code) with my phone, enlarge it, adjust brightness and contrast, and put it up to the laptop camera and it worked pretty well.

Since I'm always a bit paranoid due to my lack of experience/ knowledge, I need your guys' advice: is this something safe to do, or did I compromise my wallet's security by having that QR code on my cellphone (I deleted it right after transactionwas signed)?

"Unlikely event of kidnapping / home invastion
",1,1f14fu8,BitcoinBeginners,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/1f14fu8/unlikely_event_of_kidnapping_home_invastion/,14,"Hi colleagues, I have a question that has been bothering me for some time, and I realize that the matter is quite unlikely.

Some time ago, I saw news about some tourists in South America who were kidnapped and robbed of their bitcoins.

In fact, if you are kidnapped somewhere for a long time and you have ETFs or any assets in a bank account or digital bank (Revolut/N26) or a crypto exchange, they can always force you to convert everything into money and then convert it into cryptocurrencies and transfer it to their accounts.

So, it is probably safest to delete the apps from mobile phones before traveling. If the kidnappers are smart, they can still check your accounts through emails and thus find trading accounts, etc. So, you should log out of emails, etc., before traveling, which is quite a problem because passwords are still stored on the phone, and it automatically enters the username on these sites unless you delete that too.

What about if someone robs you at home in the middle of the night? How to protect your hardware wallet? Have a decoy hardware wallet? But they can still go to Bitstamp or Binance and see the transaction history, which then does not match the decoy wallet.

Recover forgotten BTC wallet (Circa 2010).. from a box of obsolete HDD's!,3,1eznzhi,BitcoinBeginners,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/1eznzhi/recover_forgotten_btc_wallet_circa_2010_from_a/,15,"I have an entire moving box FULL of old hard drives that I've pulled out of retired computers over the years that were destine for destruction/disposal. 

Whenever I would retire or upgrade a machine at home or at my job, I would yank the HDD out and store it away in my ""box o' drives"" for two reasons:

1. Data retention - (aka, ""oh shit, I that old document that I REALLY need was on my old PC!"")..I can easily hook the old drive up to an external drive bay, recover the file, and save the day) 

2. Privacy - After a couple years of not needing to recover anything from them, My intentions were to bring them out to into my shop, lay them out on the bed of my CNC plasma table and run a simple CNC program that burns holes in a 1x1"" grid pattern leaving each drive looking like swiss cheese, thus, rendering the data unrecoverable by your average identity thief/hacker who might be scouring the landfill for old hard drives for that purpose!

Thanks to my ADD and lack of desire to throw anything out..  the bottom line is.. I never really got around to the #2 part, so the result is, I have a big box of old hard drives.

Well, recently I was reading another one of those bullshit stories about how some kid found an old thumb drive he thought he'd lost, and it contained 100 billion dollars worth of bitcoin on it, yada yada.. and It dawned on me that this actually DID happen to ME.. sort of.. except it was only about 10 BTC (not billions worth), and I didn't ""lose"" it, I just carelessly ""abandoned"" it!

Back in 2010 (when BTC was still in it's infancy) I ran into a need for some Bitcoin in order to make a transaction on a website that only accepted BTC (don't ask üòú), and since I knew NOTHING about it at the time, I followed some instructions I found on the web.. on how to install software that allowed me to create a local ""wallet"" that I could store my bitcoin in.

Back then, a single bitcoin was worth something like $.30.  The item I wanted to buy costed something like $85 UDS shipped, so I bought $100 worth of BTC, which was just enough BTC (including the fees) to let me buy the item.. and I remember having exactly 10 BTC left over after my purchase. (worth approx. $3 USD at the time)

Since it was only $3, and I had NO intention on learning anything about trading crypto, and felt like I had no use for the 10 remaining BTC, I had little interest in preserving the software, the wallet, or the associated text file that I KNOW I saved in the folder along with my wallet that contained ALL of the ""important"" info I was told to NEVER lose when setting up the wallet (encryption key, wallet ID, or whatever).

Well skip forward 15 years, and it's time to get rid of this box of hard drives!

I can't in good conscious just dispose of the drives, knowing there's a DECENT possibility that wallet still exists on one of them, containing 10 BTC (which I don't have to tell anyone here, is now worth more than a half million dollars today!) 

The problem is, I could hook up every single one of these old drives and see the old filesystem, browse all the old files.. but STILL not have ANY idea what I'm looking for!

I don't remember the name of the software I used to help me setup the wallet.

I don't remember any of the filenames I used for the folders where I kept the wallet or its associated keys, instructions, etc.

I don't even remember anything about the computer itself that the drive was installed in at the time, so I can't narrow it down by the PC's hostname, or use other installed software as landmarks to help me figure out which drive it was!

About the only thing I CAN do is narrow it down by the size/technology of the drive itself.. I know I wasn't using a 1GB, 3200rpm, IDE drive back in 2010, so I know I'll be looking for a larger capacity drive that's got a SATA interface. So I can toss aside 1/4 of the drives in the box out of the gate.  


But once I start hooking up and looking through all these old drives, I still need to figure out WHAT to look for to find a BTC wallet!  

I was hoping to even write a script to scan through the entire drive and look for (hopefully) guaranteed, signs of a wallet of some sort!

So I'm leaning on the reddit community to help me figure out what parameters to use to hunt for this misplaced wallet!

Plain text file system search for a particular file name would be nice, but I'm not certain of ANY of the file names, and can't guarantee that the folder the wallet is stored in uses any sort of standardized/default naming convention!

I'm obviously going to search for files/folders with things like ""bitcoin, BTC, wallet, crypto"" in their names, but..

is there ANYTHING else I can use to help me definitively locate a crypto wallet on a standard (non encrypted) PC/Windows filesystem?  

ie: Do wallets all have a certain number of characters in them?  like are they always a 26 digit number, or something like that?

Any other technical info that anyone could share with me to help me systematically locate this wallet would be greatly appreciated!  

Thanks.

I'm pretty new to this stuff so I'm trying to wrap my head around all of the stuff regarding bitcoin and wallets.

Basically what happened is that she had 11/12 words of her key phrase and I spent a couple of hours figuring out how to find the last word to fulfill the checksum. After some trial and error with different possible words, I finally found her wallet with her funds in there, about 1/10 of a bitcoin. Now it was a long time ago, and her memory is hazy about the whole process when she bought the bitcoin, but she swears there should be more than that in there.

So for some more details, she originally used breadwallet (or BRD) and from what I've gathered, it's a legacy wallet. I've loaded the wallet up on Electrum with the derivation path m/0' since that's what most people were saying to do for that type of wallet. She also made one purchase back in 2015, but in the transaction history, there's only one listing, but shouldn't there be more, like when the coin(s) were added to the wallet?

If it's just that amount in the wallet that it's showing that fine and still great, but I want to be thorough and make sure there's nothing else I'm missing. Is there possibly more in there that we're not seeing? Thanks!",2024-08-18 16:08:41,1724015321.0

Restoring Bitcoin wallet - help please,3,1erhkwf,BitcoinBeginners,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/1erhkwf/restoring_bitcoin_wallet_help_please/,5,"**UPDATE** - Per a user in a diff thread: Umbrel uses a 24-word seed phrase in the AEZEED format, which is specific to LND (Lightning Network Daemon) wallets. This format is not directly compatible with wallets expecting a BIP39 seed.

BlueWallet supports AEZEED seed format so I was able to recover using BlueWallet. Phew  :-)



**BELOW IS ORIGINAL POST:** 

I used umbrel > Lightning Network app to create a bitcoin wallet. I saved 24 seed words. Umbrel crashed. Ok, but I can restore my wallet, right?

I tried Sparrow - it says ""invalid checksum"".

I tried Electrum - there is dropdown with different seed options. I tried ""Electrum seed"" but after typing in the 24 words, the NEXT button doesn't get enabled. I tried ""BIP 39 seed"" and it says ""BIP 39 checksum failed"". I think this correlates to the Sparrow failure.

I didn't know there were other seed types. I thought all Bitcoin wallets used the same BIP 39 standard.

Does anyone know how I can restore my bitcoin wallet? Thanks !",2024-08-13 14:59:03,1723579143.0

I had a question about bitcoin's buying power. So we see bitcoin's number go up relative to the currency we buy in, this could be explained by USD inflating. As fiat supply increases, price of scarce assets increase from that system.

Okay, now I want to look at the increase of buying power and would like to understand that mechanism of that. If you lived on a Bitcoin standard, so not judging the appreciation of bitcoin in USD terms but instead on the buying power increase in bitcoin terms.. what is exactly happening here?

I get that if i buy a steak with bitcoin today, the same amount of bitcoin 
should be able to buy the same steak in the future as bitcoin cannot be inflated.

My question is, some bitcoiners talk about how their buying power increases over time, so that bitcoin for 1 steak can buy 2 steaks in 4 years or so. What is the mechanism of that? Is it related to the adoption of capital flowing in? Is it related to how the market is naturally deflationary and we are finally able to see it from a bitcoin standard (jeff booth)? 

Any explanation and reasoning is welcome!

Your cash goes into a sweep account that pays very nicely then when you're putting money to work you just have to sign in and push a couple buttons to make your trade. NO FEES!!!! I think you'll see FBTC performs much the same as Bitcoin. For added profit and fun I buy bitx, a leveraged fund that will usually move 2 times what Bitcoin does. The good thing with BITX is you can buy shares then sell covered calls against the shares you own. This locks in profit and usually adds a bunch of free money when the covered calls expire. I don't trust all these wallet, they can be hacked, disappear, whatever, who is behind them, but a Fidelity or Merrill Lynch account for example is insured and you can trust it will be there.

I sent like $25 worth of BTC to the wallet‚Äôs Bitcoin account and then used the internal swapping mechanism to swap all the bitcoin to Layer 2. So far so good. 

I started to get confused though because the Level 2 account holds l-btc (liquid) but apparently also has the ability to transfer sats on the Lightning Network. 

I then wanted to send some sats from Aqua to my Muun wallet via Lightning, to test its ability to send sats. But every time I try and send the sats I get an error message ‚Äúsomething went wrong‚Äù and then a bunch of illegible words and numbers. 

Thing is, even though the transaction failed, the wallet or whoever runs the channel still took the small sats as fees. I tried many many different times and many different amounts, all the time with the same error and sats fees deducted.

Best current option for running a full node,3,1ekozzs,BitcoinBeginners,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/1ekozzs/best_current_option_for_running_a_full_node/,15,"Hi all,

I've been running Umbrel for about 2.5 - 3 years now and I think I'm finally done with it. Every month or two I would need to reflash UmbrelOS or configure my node in some way because it went down. Well after fighting with this stupid thing the past 2 weekends, I cannot even get it to connect anymore. I'm done.

So, that said, what are some of the best options available right now? I was running Umbrel on a Raspberry Pi 4 with a 2 TB SSD. I'm open to upgrading my hardware, but it would be nice to save some money and repurpose my current setup.

I'm not super techy which is why I opted for Umbrel in the first place. I've heard good things about Raspibolt and RaspiBlitz, but they seem a little heavy for someone like me.

I've also heard good things about MyNode and Start9 seems to be the new gold standard. After all this time fighting with Umbel, I like the idea of just plugging something in and having it work. Another thing to consider is WiFi capabilities. I'm not exactly in a position where I can connect a node directly to the router so I liked the capability of Umbrel to connect over WiFi.

What is everyone using and does anyone have any recommendations? Thanks!",2024-08-05 09:19:52,1722867592.0

Liquid fees compared to Lightning (ideal for swapping BTC),9,1ej1bs0,BitcoinBeginners,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/1ej1bs0/liquid_fees_compared_to_lightning_ideal_for/,1,"I've been testing the use of Liquid and Lightning wallets since some exchanges offer free Lightning withdraw (Kraken). I like the Aqua interface (i.e. ""spending"" and ""savings"" integrated into one self custodial wallet) but don't see the benefit of Liquid unless you're planning to only use it for spending.

As a way to get to cold storage but avoid the high fees of exchanges (most don't have a custom send fee option like wallets do) the Lightning feature of Muun seems better than Aqua (and better than manually swapping through Boltz or Sideswipe). Breez is a true Lightning wallet but the swap fees are high.

Here's some recent data from 4 wallets showing the cost to send BTC with swap fees included (and also the Lightning to Lightning if you are staying off chain).

Fees for sending 150,000 sats (Note:on Kraken exchange it's a flat 20,000 sats withdraw fee):

**Aqua** (can receive LN or LQ and swap within app)  
BTC = 865-1325 sats (15 receive + 410 swap + 440-900 send)  
LN = 425 sats (internally swapping LQ to LN)  
**Muun** (uses subs on LN-BTC send)  
**BTC = 573-675** (internally swapping any LN to BTC)  
LN = 745 (internally swapping BTC to LN)  
**Breez** (uses Boltz for send to BTC)¬†  
BTC = 2361 (1681 is Boltz‚Äô fee)  
**LN = 15**  
**Green** (no swap options, so just for comparison)  
BTC = 440-930  
LN = 15

My conclusion is that Muun is the cheapest and easiest to get to cold storage, just not ideal for sending Lightning, Breez works better for that. Aqua is better for Liquid (if it has a viable use? I don't know an exchange that offers free send through Liquid). And Green offers both Lightning (Beta) and Liquid, but no swaps.",2024-08-03 06:41:10,1722685270.0

Transitioning BTC from exchange to wallet,1,1eikviv,BitcoinBeginners,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/1eikviv/transitioning_btc_from_exchange_to_wallet/,3,"Hello cryptofriends! My specific questions are: 

1) Why am I not always able to import my wallet? 

2) What is the best way to just safely generate a good old fashioned private and public key.

3) Also just out of curiosity, is ""WIF"" synonymous with ""private key""?

I know the adage ""not your keys, not your coins"", so I'm making the transition from an exchange to a wallet. But I'm having some trouble feeling ensured my coins will be safe.

  
I don't trust hardware wallets because hardware can break. I've been experimenting generating wallets with one software wallet, using my mnemonic phrase to open that wallet with a different software wallet, and then send it back to the exchange. This only sometimes works. I've noticed some incompatibility between Electrum and Sparrow and BlueWallet. Sometimes I'm able to open the wallet, but the coins just wont be there.  

  
The other thing that has me uncertain is this [old post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p9fcui/8_fun_facts_about_your_seed_phrase_you_might_not/) on r/CryptoCurrency that states:

**for long term archiving of your seed phrase, be sure to also record what software produced it and for what coin you created the keys.**

I don't want to have to rely on a software version 50 years from now, I would be more comfortable with just a good old fashioned public and private key, that was easy to import into any wallet,  but the newer software wallets don't seem to provide this information; only the seed phrase. When I was in Electrum wallet I **thought** I was able to see the private key, but there was like 20 of them, and none of them worked when I tried to import them into other wallets. Why were there so many of them?

  
I presume the solution to my uncertainty is to learn how to do all this myself on a RaspberryPi and run a node or something, but that is way to technical for a luddite like me.

So once again, my specific questions are: 

1) Why am I not always able to import my wallet? 

2) What is the best way to just safely generate a good old fashioned private and public key.

3) Also just out of curiosity, is ""WIF"" synonymous with ""private key""?

THANKS!

Let's say a wealthy person holds 10 BTC.

Wouldn't it be more secure to have a passphrase attached to that wallet AND use at least 2 other wallets?

Noob looking for a few answers,11,1ehnton,BitcoinBeginners,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/1ehnton/noob_looking_for_a_few_answers/,13,"Hey everyone, I‚Äôm new to Bitcoin, but have been doing my research and I‚Äôve decided to invest an amount I‚Äôm comfortable with, that I can afford to lose.¬†

I plan on just buying a set amount and riding it for 10+ years, and may invest a little more over time but I have my other investments and am approaching this as more gambling than investing TBTH.

I have a basic understanding of Bitcoin technology and the blockchain, the best exchanges to buy from, and the importance of cold storage.

I just purchased a Trezor Safe 3/Bitcoin only device for storage and am waiting for it to be delivered.

I purchased directly from Trezor as I am aware not to buy from any third parties.

I haven‚Äôt bought any Bitcoin yet, but plan to after I get a few answers from this post to help confirm some of the things I learned/clear up several issues for me.

Here are a few things I am already aware of:

1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Use a reputable exchange like Coinbase or Kraken

2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†When I transfer into cold storage, do a small transfer to ensure the address is right

3.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†If I F up, I will lose my Bitcoin forever

4.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Bitcoin investing is volatile

5.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†HODL (Hold on for dear life)

6.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†The blockchain is kind of like a big database of all bitcoin transactions

7.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†I will have to download Trezor suite software to run with my Safe 3 device

8.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†My trezor will give me a 12 word seed that I need to write down and keep secure

Things I need help understanding:

1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Once I put my Bitcoin into cold storage, and I want to check my balance in a few months, do I plug my Safe 3 in, input my pin, and it connects to the Trezor software on my computer to show my balance?

2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†The 12 word seed that I am given, will that change if I decide to buy other Bitcoin over several months, or will I just be given a new address? I‚Äôm a little confused how the seed/adresss works each time I make a transaction.

3.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Is there a way to test my seed words before I transfer over all of my bitcoin into cold storage?

I'm mostly just paranoid about having my Bitcoin in cold storage and in ten years my seed words don't work or something stupid happens because I make a mistake, my Safe 3 doesn't work, etc.

  
That aspect just worries me so I want to make sure I understand everything down to a T before I invest.

The blockchain records transactions on a public ledger, but the specific amounts in cold storage remain off-chain. The balance of a wallet is determined by the history of transactions associated with it. When a user moves crypto from cold storage to a hot wallet for trading or spending, the blockchain updates the ledger to reflect the transfer. Therefore, the blockchain indirectly tracks the movement of crypto amounts, but the specific amounts in cold storage are not visible on the public ledger until they are moved.""",2024-07-23 18:52:11,1721778731.0

Using Bitcoin with a Hardware Wallet through Sparrow,3,1eab893,BitcoinBeginners,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/1eab893/using_bitcoin_with_a_hardware_wallet_through/,18,"I'm considering using Bitcoin with a hardware wallet (HW) via Sparrow Wallet, but I have a few concerns and questions.

1. **Security and Privacy Concerns with Public Nodes**:
   * How insecure is it to use Bitcoin through a public node in Sparrow?
   * I understand that querying the blockchain via a public node can compromise some privacy, potentially associating my transactions with my IP address. What are the real dangers of this?
2. **Running a Personal Node**:
   * Is it really necessary for a user who doesn't want complications?
   * I understand the utility of running a node, but shouldn't it be less ""dangerous"" to rely on a public node in Electrum? Are there any ""trusted"" or generally accepted public nodes?
3. **Ease of Use and Privacy**:
   * Is there an easy way to ensure privacy while using a public node?
   * With Trezor Suite, even connected through TOR, I feel I lack privacy. I haven't switched to Sparrow (signing with my HW) because I'm not sure if it's a good decision.
4. **Labeling System**:
   * I have a labeling system in Trezor Suite. Can I import this into Sparrow without messing everything up?
5. **Advantages and Disadvantages**:
   * What are the pros and cons of using Sparrow over Trezor Suite?

I'd appreciate any insights or advice on these questions, especially from those who have experience with both Sparrow and Trezor Suite. Thank you!",2024-07-23 10:49:17,1721749757.0

Question about digital signature safety when sending bitcoin ,2,1e8mloj,BitcoinBeginners,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/1e8mloj/question_about_digital_signature_safety_when/,8,"Complete beginning here.

  
I gather that when I send bitcoin, there is a signature generated using my private key. By checking my signature and public key (both included in the transaction and therefore both public), it is possible to determine that the signature came from the holder of the private key. However it is not possible to use the signature and public key to obtain the private key. 

My question is: my signature and public key are both public, as included in the transaction. Can a malicious actor now re-use my signature and public key to send/steal the rest of the funds from my wallet in a second transaction?

I know this isn't possible, I just don't understand how (again, I'm a complete beginner). I'm guessing the public key never changes, but something about the signature means it is only valid once, or valid only for a specific transaction? 

Thanks for any help!!

From my understanding if I want to use the LN network and I have BTC in cold storage (Trezor) I can send it to Strike via on chain address and than would I be able convert it to LN in the app to make payments via LN? 

Is this the best way to do it in regard to transaction fees or is there a better way to go about it?

"Swan iOS a frustrating, sketchy fiasco",3,1e5pncz,BitcoinBeginners,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/1e5pncz/swan_ios_a_frustrating_sketchy_fiasco/,2,"For all the high praise of Swan as a company their iPad/iPhone App is glitchy and disappointing, like some unprofessional, untrustworthy startup. 

Signing up was pretty standard KYC info like other US exchanges, but then for over two days the App acted like it was hung up ‚Äúprocessing application‚Äù. I was only approved after contacting support. I then connected a bank account and that verified immediately, but adding a second bank account caused the message ‚Äúverifying bank, please wait 1-3 days‚Äù. This prohibited me from accessing anything on the App, nor could I use the previously approved bank account to buy Bitcoin‚Ä¶ 

After three days of waiting and nothing changing I contact support again to inquire about the delay. I kept waiting 1 week before they finally responded simply to say I was not approved for ACH payments, and could only use Wire transfers, no further explanation. 

BUT the iOS App STILL has the same error message and prevents any action, 10 emails to support later, no fix yet, just ‚Äúsorry, use our website to wire us funds‚Äù. Sadly, I will be dumping such incompetence after using their initial no-fee purchase. 

This exchange deserves a better App, and is not worth such nonsense, because the added Wire fee I‚Äôll have to pay to fund the account negates the savings of free BTC Send. I can confirm that Bitcoin Well and Coinbase both have cheaper options without any Wire transfer hassle. Sorry Swan, I really wanted to have a good experience! #disappointedHODLer

"Aqua, Muun and Green wallet fees compared, does this look correct?",1,1e5glp0,BitcoinBeginners,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/1e5glp0/aqua_muun_and_green_wallet_fees_compared_does/,0,"I have been testing Muun vs. Aqua (and also Green) and it seems that Muun is actually cheaper because it saves steps/fees. Does the following data track correctly?

Right now Lightning/Liquid options are providing some cheaper ways to move from an Exchange to Cold Storage, right? (especially for those of us that can‚Äôt get River or Strike to verify us üòë) If it‚Äôs free to send by Lightning (i.e. Kraken) Muun then receives that for free and has only one step/fee to send BTC on chain to a cold wallet. In my test the total Muun fees were 1.6%

But Aqua charges a small fee to receive Lightning (like .35%), then you pay a¬†¬†bigger fee to swap into your BTC (my test was about 1.75% on 100k sats - which was still cheaper than doing this myself via Boltz), and then you pay a fee to move from the BTC wallet to a cold wallet. In my test the total Aqua fees totaled 2.4%

(For Green, their experimental Lightning wallet is currently very glitchy, and it would require a manual swap then via Boltz to covert ot BTC and send to the Jade Hardware Wallet. I couldn‚Äôt complete a test, but the manual swap in Boltz is only cheaper than Muun up to 175k sats, for higher amounts the .5% extra Boltz charge makes Muun the cheaper option than Green/Boltz)

For BTC Send fees Muun allows custom speed that is not quite as low/cheap as Aqua allows (maybe that‚Äôs where Muun ‚Äùbundles‚Äù the swap fee?). Muun won‚Äôt let you go below some ‚Äúminimum market speed‚Äù (i.e. like 6.5 sats/vbyte) whereas Aqua lets you specify anywhere from 2-5 sats/vbyte. But adding the swap fee in Aqua always makes it more expensive than Muun.¬†

Now if you‚Äôre sending/receiving Liquid than Muun isn‚Äôt an option. But my test of sending Liquid from Aqua to Green was slightly more expensive than via Lightning (i.e. 140-260 on 10k sats on Liquid vs. 65 sats on Lightning). Thus, if Lightning is cheaper than Liquid and Muun is cheaper than Aqua???

What am I missing? According to previous posts that I could find on Reddit Muun is considered more expensive because it‚Äôs not a true lightning wallet, but if your goal is staking sats then Muun is actually cheaper.¬†But if you‚Äôre dealing in Liquid then Aqua is the better option. And if you need a pure Lightning wallet for spending then Green might be good once they work out the current bugs. (but only if you‚Äôre not planning to convert to BTC)

So if Bitcoin fails to move in this direction its value will slowly wither away. The questions I have is  if there is any data that supports that the use of Bitcoin as a legitimate currency has been increasing over time, if the energy consumption of Bitcoin mining and transactions will be to great for a grid to support, if the existence Bitcoin transfer Fees make it so that Bitcoin will never be practical for small transactions, and what happens after the last bitcoin gets mined?
