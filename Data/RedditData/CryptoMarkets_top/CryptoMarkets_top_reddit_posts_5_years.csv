Dark time to be a crypto investor,1062,o5mtbq,CryptoMarkets,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/o5mtbq/dark_time_to_be_a_crypto_investor/,424,"It is a hard time for all crypto investors right now. Literally everything is red, esp after it has been a hard couple weeks on the crypto markers. Many of us are holding bags, many of us have lost money that we couldn't afford to lose, some of us might not be able to pay rent or mortgages or possibly even buy food...

&#x200B;

Most of us invested in crypto to 'get rich' or at least escape poverty... weather we like to admit it or not we invest because we want a better life for ourselves, our family, our children etc

&#x200B;

Sure people who are on their high horse will say don't spend money you cant lose, dont over leverage, dont buy crypto, dont xyz - But that doesn't help in this moment and it isnt fair to be kicked when you're down.

&#x200B;

There have been many crashes in crypto and probably many more to come. I'm not here to tell you to Hold or buy the dip or even sell. I'm just here to tell you that you're not alone, tomorrow is another day.

&#x200B;

So where ever you are around the world, whatever you do just know others are all hurting just like you right now and we will be better investors for this experience and for those that are HODLing like me just know we will see better days again and not to give up on chasing a better financial future for yourself.

My no.1 tip to find gems before anyone else,1032,qqh6qd,CryptoMarkets,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/qqh6qd/my_no1_tip_to_find_gems_before_anyone_else/,471,"So, I'm sharing a secret tip of mine that I've used to make most of my gains this season.

**A technique I've refined to find amazing, under the radar Twitter profiles.**

Because in my opinion, following the correct accounts on Twitter can have a huge benefit to your success in this space.

I'm not talking about huge influencers. I'm talking about those insane, under the radar accounts with a few thousand followers who are just freaks at finding gems.

**So, here's how.**

When you come across a project/coin that has done incredibly well, search the $Cashtag in Twitter (e.g. $PILOT), but then select the three dots in the top corner for 'Advanced Search.'

In the advanced search, re-enter the $Cashtag in the top field and then scroll to the bottom to find 'Dates.' Here, you can select an exact date range to refine your search!

**The important part: choose dates before a coin started to blow up.**

For example, search $PILOT and select the date range October 10, 2021, to October 15, 2021.

The result?

You'll find whoever was talking about PILOT before it blew up. These are people who had conviction before anyone else (and even enough conviction to post about on Twitter about it).

You can now follow these accounts and wait for the next project they talk about.

You'll end up finding the most amazing accounts who will provide the alpha going forward.

**EDIT: Then you DYOR on these projects!! I'm not saying ape blindly into whatever they call next haha, it's a starting point for finding new projects then commencing your own research.**

Lastly, some of these smaller accounts have Telegram or Discords in their bio, so you can interact with them directly. This lets you dive even deeper.

Hope this helps! WAGMI",2021-11-09 18:12:18,1636503138.0

Evergrande‚Äôs Situation & Crypto,603,pt07qw,CryptoMarkets,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/pt07qw/evergrandes_situation_crypto/,102,"I keep seeing people post about Evergrande making interest payments on time and that the world is good again. I used to work on a bulge bracket Asia HY bond desk and this is not the case. 

Twitter and the Media is missing the full picture and no one has pointed it out yet. üëá

We aren‚Äôt fully out of the woods. There is a difference between onshore (denominated in CNY) and offshore bonds (USD). Evergrande has offshore coupon denominated in USD due Sep 23 and have yet to make an announcement on those. Given a choice, they would pay onshore first. Should they decide not to pay USD, this will hurt global investors regardless. That said, there is still a 30-day grace period so it‚Äôs not end of the world, even if they don‚Äôt. 

The CCP won‚Äôt directly step in but they will save the house buyers in the case of a default (so they don‚Äôt see any protesting etc). SOE banks will be the first to get screwed and majority of loans/commercial papers are to them. The scary part is that we‚Äôre not too sure how many of these guys re-levered this debt into other instruments so there may be ticking bombs all around. 

Ultimately, the nearest USD coupon that is due is on Sept 23rd (Thursday), roughly equating to US$100m in interest. Sure, you may meet that interest but the company still has $300bn of principal coupon worth to pay. 

Personally, I see a few routes moving forward but one needs to look at the debt structure (1). horizontally (time-based) and (2). vertically (who and what type of debt do they hold) to see a better picture.

Horizontally:
- Sept 23, $83mio in interest due
- Sept 29, $45mio in interest due
- Oct 11, $~160mio in interest due
- Nov 6, $80mio in interest due
- Dec 28, $250mio in interest due

Vertically:
- 54% of its $300bn are in secured borrowings
- 2% are convertible bonds (lower pecking order)
- 21% are senior notes (this is mostly held by UHNW individuals and big funds/banks)
- 6% PRC bonds (local onshore denominated debt)
- 17% Unsecured direct bank borrowings (mostly to SOE banks)

That said, my gutfeel is that the CCP will go in indirectly via the SOE banks taking the brunt of the hurt; they‚Äôll likely working their butts off now with some meeting of sort with all EVERRE‚Äôs biggest debt/equity backers. The key players in this game are:

[In order of importance to the CCP]. 
1. People who bought homes (they will be taken care off first)
2. Suppliers and construction companies contracted (perhaps this may be next)
3. Public debt holders (UHNW/Funds/Banks) ‚Äì the key people here are the funds/banks
4. SOE banks who provided direct loans (govt backed anyways)
5. Equity holders. 

My guess at the end: some SOE banks come in with some package to save certain pieces of the above pie. Perhaps the CEO/management team gets reprimanded strongly? Either ways, this is the largest elephant in the room now and the Crypto market is worried of the repercussions and quakes that we could feel from this fallout.

That said... enough about Evergrande, Crypto is dealing with its own troubles. Messari's Mainnet event got hijacked by a SEC subpoena, Mr Gensler called stablecoins 'poker chips' (we get it), and Binance derivatives service got clamped down in Australia.

On-chain data wise: During the dip, BTC's LTH-SOPR (1.26) vs STH-SOPR (0.97) indicated short-term holders (speculators, swing-traders, etc.) sold into losses, while long-term holders took profit. Regardless, the stablecoin supply ratio fell, and the exchange reserves of BTC is nearing a six-month low. This suggest traders are flushed with cash, but whether they are willing to step in (presumably on long leverage positions) is another question. For the second day, BTC Long liquidation also indicated a sharp up spike relative to the past 12 days while the estimated leverage ratio hovered at the mid-point (relative to the past two weeks), suggesting a very risk-off environment.

In derivatives: BTC and ETH option contract open interest held constant while traders adopted a wait-and-see approach to prices. Options skew indicators reflect a different story: 25% delta skew (Volatility premium for puts to calls), a significant jump, reflecting a high belief among option traders that further downward movement is imminent. Coin days destroyed also show that the move was mostly driven by short-term traders. 

Personally, I like to fade such event-driven markets (but only post FOMC). Just note that conditions are primed such that if we get very positive news, people are flushed with cash for a jolt back to risk. A gentle nudge to also remember just how short-term market participant thinks, and that one only needs to look just over the ridge to stay ahead. IMO, the Evergrande fiasco is starting to look more like a very controlled detonation by the CCP - even if their offshore entity defaults (after the 30-day grace period), it won‚Äôt trigger a cross-default to its onshore entity. Finally‚Ä¶ I actually took Gary Gensler Washington Post interview early this morning to be bullish for Crypto long term. We certainly need certain aspects of the market to be reined in to progress further. Have a good one!

I hadn‚Äôt heard of Token||Traxx until just recently, it‚Äôs a music NFT marketplace kind of thing ‚Äúfor musicians by musicians‚Äù that‚Äôll reward you for collecting, sharing and creating music. I managed to get involved with their bounty campaign. I saw they were offering $10k in their TRAXX tokens, and also a chance to win their guestlist NFTs.

When I completed the task and signed up, this is what they sent me over email:

* Priority platform access at launch, ahead of the public access.
* Access to exclusive NFT releases.
* Direct connection to the founding team through our community channels.
* First to receive platform news and developments.

You can see for yourself here let me know what y‚Äôall think [https://tokentraxx.com/#guestlist](https://tokentraxx.com/#guestlist) 

They‚Äôre also launching their token on March 14th - anyone else think to ape into this? Saw that they just announced this recently on their Twitter [https://twitter.com/Token\_Traxx](https://twitter.com/Token_Traxx)

Cardano has done surprisingly well in troubled waters,466,ncedvr,CryptoMarkets,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/ncedvr/cardano_has_done_surprisingly_well_in_troubled/,142,"The last few days have seen significant flux in the crypto market. Elon declared an end to the ‚Äúbuy a Tesla with Bitcoin‚Äù stunt. Binance landed in deep water with regulators in the US. Coinbase continued to underperform against expectations in the stock market. Most coins and tokens trended down.

It is interesting how Cardano has flowed through this mess appreciating rather than decreasing in value. This is probably due to two simple things. One, it‚Äôs not Bitcoin, so it‚Äôs not in the primary spotlight of negative news. Two, it‚Äôs got perhaps the most momentum of third generation blockchains, and that makes it an easy hedge for those concerned with point one.

However, let‚Äôs not get ahead of ourselves. ADA is probably overpriced right now, riding on a halo due to low interest capital, crypto hype, and the primary market option floundering. A re-pricing will probably occur, I would suggest alongside ETH, as both have surged far ahead of their internal market growth. By that, I mean ahead of the smart contracts or profitable tokens, or practical global deployments matching the scaling of the token price.

These are heady times. It is a perfect moment to keep your hat firmly attached, stick to your long term plans, and not get distracted.

== Additional Note ==

I‚Äôm bullish about the long term, but I suspect we will have a jolt in the short term as peak crypto 2021 passes. It‚Äôs important to remember than the last time that happened, Cardano went from $1.0085 on January 1st 2018 to $0.1508 on March 26th 2018. In the latter part of the year it was trading in the 2 to 4 cent level with spikes to around 8 cent until April 2020, when it started the current upward trend, significantly accelerating in 2021. I don‚Äôt expect as dramatic a repricing this time because the fundamentals have improved. Nevertheless‚Ä¶ one should reread the paragraph above if one finds oneself getting too excited.",2021-05-14 12:41:20,1621014080.0

Here in the midst of the collapse of their 2nd largest real estate company, the Chinese thinks it's wise to declare crypto illegal. Like wow, THAT'LL save the markets. CCP comin thru to once again save the fucking people like they always have right?? 

For me, It's similar to Elon's tweets in the sense that the more it keeps happening, the less and less effect it has. If anything it just makes more and more people interested in why a country seemingly has to keep banning the same damn thing over and over again.  

I don't think I'd last a second in China given how much shit I'd be talking. Seriously, people's obsession with control is truly fascinating, and I can't wait to see the CCP's grip on people start to wane. The same applies to the US government. Can't wait for the next war on *insert noun here*, in this case crypto.  When you take a second to think about it, each of these governments are filled with boomers who are more or less going to fucking DIE in the next decade or so. So don't you dare let their naive cluelessness influence your decades down the road. 

My point is, brothers and sisters, FUCK anything a government tells you is ok or not ok, it is certainly not in your interest to follow their beliefs. But for the smart ones out there, y'all already knew that huh? Keep holding you guys, it'll be fine. 

And if you sold, kudos to you, I hope you left with a bag.",2021-09-24 07:21:53,1632486113.0

I have an unhealthy obsessions with cryptocurrency, and data which fuelled my desire to create an easy to use dashboard with minimal barriers to entry (completely free, no signups).

I haven't really marketed it at all since i'm not 'selling' anything but I would like to share my work in case someone finds value and can benefit from it themselves :)

Hope you find some value in what i've created - if not, i'm always open to feedback and suggestions.

You can view......

* Live trading price feed across most well known exchanges
* Live liquidations as they occur across most exchanges
* Live whale-watching movements (to and from exchanges \~ wallets)
* View various metrics such as historical fear/greed, open interest, company holdings, news
* Practice your trading skills with a simple paper-trading simulator (i'll be running a little competition soon)
* Socialise with other people in the community chat - or don't - it's up to you and the site is fully usable without registering/logging in (aside from the paper-trading as you need an account to preserve your data).

... and a bunch more stuff!

The tribalism in Crypto is cringe. It‚Äôs the opposite of decentralization. Anyone in here who thinks they have all of the answers is full of it and there is a lot of money to made off of altcoins.

Which by the way would be the last thing I would be doing because eventually I see them personally getting sued or Reddit over Moon distribution. I see it here. I just saw a post somebody marked as ‚ÄúScam‚Äù about Shiba (I own none). I could care less if you do. In fact awesome if you own Shiba. I hope you make a ton of money. Nobody in here has the answers. I see all of these people directing hate towards communities and it‚Äôs pathetic. I‚Äôm wondering why people put so much hate into it. Half of you are taking financial advice from high school kids or a man child keyboard warrior. There is a ton of good projects and we are really early at this point. If these people knew what they were talking about they wouldn‚Äôt be on here giving out free advice because they wouldn‚Äôt need to be. In fact I started buying coins people hate on and it‚Äôs been working. Right now in crypto sediment matters more than utility in a lot of cases. Your TA is a joke because it means nothing. It‚Äôs a waste of time and the whole stock market is rigged so you TA means shit there as well. Get over yourselves nobody here is a crypto prophet. All I see is a bunch of Jim Cramers on YouTube making money off of likes. One that comes to mind would be BitBoy. That guy sources bad articles and has never called one damn thing correctly yet I hear people echo his claims constantly as it‚Äôs all has to be true. Do your own research.

Ticketmaster watch out. NFT tickets are about to disrupt the ticketing industry. A comprehensive list of people who have advcated the benefits of NFT ticketing: From Mark Cuban to Vitalik,359,slwsqw,CryptoMarkets,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/slwsqw/ticketmaster_watch_out_nft_tickets_are_about_to/,97," **Benefits of NFT tickets include:**

&#x200B;

* **Preventing scams and fake tickets**: The blockchain provides a single source of truth for both organisers and ticket holders. The transfer of NFTs from initial sale to any subsequent resale is recorded immutably on the blockchain, so all parties involved can easily verify the authenticity of the ticket. Even cooler, in cases where resale of tickets is strictly forbidden, NFTs can be programmed as non-transferrable, so they physically cannot be moved to another buyer.
* **Perpetual revenue:** As programmable digital assets NFTs can have built-in rules for resales, merchandise, content and royalty splits. This means that the organiser can determine profit sharing percentages for any future resales or downstream creative content on secondary markets, and reliably receive these funds knowing they are unalterable within the NFT‚Äôs coding.
* **New revenue opportunities:** NFTs put tickets into the realm of programmable money, opening up unlimited potential for new revenue opportunities. For example resale of NFT tickets as **collectables,** using NFT tickets as a gateway for giving food and drink deals, even rewarding super fans who have collected a certain number of event tickets.

Over the past year the NFT tickets have gained more attention in the crypto space. I have compiled extensive list of developers, investors, financial instintutions, ticketing companies and NBA owners that have advocated the benefits of NFT ticketing

Some of you might already knew about Greyscale or Kucoin shorting Doge in May and causing it's price to drop, or Elon Musk suddenly causing BTC to crash(and Dogecoin with it), but it was only the begining. Now they want new coin that they market as ""one that will bonk Doge"" to create meltdown in the crypto market and spark the need for regulations.

Here's some of that involvement illustrated here: [https://i.imgur.com/IYS33Yu.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/IYS33Yu.jpg)

There's no way all these people decided to just get into some coin out of nowhere without big plan for it. There are even ""mysterious donors"" in their community that literally buy billboard ads in NY (see: [https://i.imgur.com/1Uzc5MG.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/1Uzc5MG.jpg)) and there's more and more coming in Australia, Germany, even in London or freaking Dubai, this isn't organic!

Something like that doesn't just pop up organically, it's all planned. Nothing is like it seems. We need to spread awareness of this to whole crypto community, because it's not only attack again the Dogecoin, it's attack on whole crypto itself! Also, there's Bill Gates.

Please help me spread awareness about this.",2021-11-19 10:15:16,1637338516.0

I do it myself. I transfer $1000 in AAVE from robinhood to a brand new trust wallet account. 

3 hours go by. I check congestion on the network meticulously. That was one of the claims people told me they were getting.  

My transaction fails. They charge me $106 in transaction fees and return my $894. 

I reach out to customer support. They tell me the failed transaction number doesn‚Äôt exist. We all know the outbound always exists on etherecan.  

I say that‚Äôs not how this works. 

They blame ethereum network. Tell me ethereum gas fees are taken by someone else. Not them. 

Eth didn‚Äôt have insane congestion today to the point where a txn would fail. I request an initiation txn number. Or any proof the transaction started. Customer service states it doesn‚Äôt exist again. 

Robinhood is stealing transaction fees for outbound transactions. The customer support agent folded and said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll forward this up to someone.‚Äù 

If you‚Äôve had this happen. Send your claim to the SEC.

At this time of writing, ~~1inch DEX edit: 1inch is back to sub $6~~, it seems [`https://raydium.io`](https://raydium.bio/) dex still has plenty of liquidity in the 7-9$ FTT range, while the price listed on ftx is under $4. strange

Is there any CEX that is allowing FTT withdrawals at the moment? I have a potential money making idea id like to try.

And, rumor has it that FTT will be heading right back to $20+ by next week. Binance is buying FTX, yes ,but FTX will remain as a seperate entity and thus FTT will remain valuable

anyhow, lets ride this storm out guys, calm and dont panic sell or do anything stupid

So basically traders on Robinhood were left perplexed by a seemingly steep discount in the price of bitcoin on the investment and yes, the issue has since been resolved, but customers who tried to execute trades during that time have been left with unfilled orders?

Everything is a SCAM. ,199,1ewuobq,CryptoMarkets,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1ewuobq/everything_is_a_scam/,200,"It's disheartening to see so many people talking about crypto being a scam. Most of the crypto Reddit forums are bearish which makes me more bullish. It is impossible for crypto to be a scam. The code, the blockchain, they aren't inheritly scammy. Crypto is the only industry where everybody is blamed for the actions of a few bad actors. 

In the 1920s people were over leveraging their positions in stocks. Then the market crashed. 
Were stocks a scam? 

After the markets crashed a guy named Charles Ponzi created a scheme where you couldn't lose money. He promised a fixed return of 50% in 90 days. Thousands of people still reeling from the crash of the 1920s put what they could in Charles investment scheme. You should know what happened next. Charles gave people pieces of paper and they gave him money. 
Was money a scam? 

Bernie Madoff ran the same Ponzi scheme 60 years later. He was smart enough to only promise 15% per year. But he told people it was from trading, when it was really just a scam. Bernie was found guilty. But stocks and investments kept on. 

Crypto has gone through numerous of these disaster situations. The latest ones are the ones I believe are affecting your mental the most. One of them was Sam Bankman Fried. There was nothing elusive or slick about what he did. You deposited money into his exchange and he put that into his personal account. People who had the power to stop him were too close to the situation because they were invested themselves. He also took rival cryptos he didn't like and sold them to drive the narrative that Solana was superior to everything else. 

Luna was a design flaw. It was going to crash eventually. People signed up on a proprietary website without any 3rd party validation and once again thought they were getting 20% interest. The interest was in a mintable token so to maintain the rate all they had to do was turn on the money printer. 

Newsflash this is how the current money system plays out. You put money in a bank and the bank promises you an interest rate. The rate just happens to be a bit lower than the federal rate. Translation the bank is paying your ""interest"" backed by the government which can't fail. All the government has to do is print more money. This is how the entire monetary system plays out. Is the entire monetary system a scam? (hehe you won't like my answer) 

There are bad actors in every part of the financial system. But you don't blame stocks when a single company crashes. You don't blame the money when you get scammed. But when crypto scams happen you blame the entire industry. 

Crypto is here to stay, and there's lots of opportunity in it. But not if you focus on the negative. ",2024-08-20 07:49:38,1724158178.0

I've lost everything trading with high leverage,120,1detp7c,CryptoMarkets,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1detp7c/ive_lost_everything_trading_with_high_leverage/,172,"About a year ago, I bought BTC and ETH without leverage and that has brought me with %100+ returns and almost $600 in profit which is a lot for me. I've read tons of stories about how people lost everything after getting overconfident, and I'm sad to say I fell down the same path.

Before I say anything more, I want to mention that I'm only 15, and definitely didn't know enough to be playing with leverage. In short, I convinced my parents that I will invest another $400 (all the money I had left other than the initial BTC and ETH) and decided to put it into RNDR, after a 10% dip with 5x leverage. Little did I know that dip would soon dip even more, as I watched my balance slowly decrease, 10%, 20%, 30% and finally 50% where I closed my position and decided to open another position with 10x leverage to try and recover my losses. This ended up being the last time I see the money as I soon ended up getting liquidated and losing everything.

I know for some of you here $400 is nothing but as a 15 year old that's all I had saved up. I've always been the type to never spend any of my allowance money and always save it so losing years worth of that really is a pain. On one hand I'm grateful I learned this lesson this early on made a promise to myself now to never use leverage again.

If anyone reading this is thinking of starting leverage trading I hope this made you change your mind and possible save you hundreds or even thousands. I'm done trading now and will just hold my BTC and ETH.",2024-06-13 03:03:52,1718265832.0
